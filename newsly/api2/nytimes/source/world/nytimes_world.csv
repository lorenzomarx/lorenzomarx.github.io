In time, the family’s food dwindled and Ms. Beley, a baker, said she fed her hungry children one bowl of porridge a day to share between them. Her 6-year-old daughter, Ivanka, dreamed of the poppy seed sweet rolls her mother had made before the war.“It tears you apart,” said Ms. Beley, 33, still traumatized after her escape from the city a week ago. “I just sobbed, just cried, screaming into the pillow when no one could see.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyShortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, it laid siege to Mariupol, using the ancient warfare tactic to try to starve the once-bustling city of 430,000 people into surrender.ImageWomen pushing mostly empty shopping carts near a damaged block of apartments in Mariupol on March 17.

Blinken accused Russia of “starving” cities in Ukraine. He invoked the memory of the brother of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Viktor, who died in infancy during the German siege of Leningrad during World War II.“It is shameful,” Mr. Blinken said. “The world is saying to Russia, ‘Stop these attacks immediately. Let the food and medicine in. Let the people out safely, and end this war of choice against Ukraine’.”Scholars of siege warfare say the tactic serves different purposes: to weaken enemies while avoiding clashes that can kill the besieging force’s own soldiers, or to freeze active fronts while attacking forces reposition. But the grueling nature of sieges — and how they use hunger to turn people’s own bodies against them — give them a psychological power unique among war tactics, according to scholars and siege survivors.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Siege is a way to break the will and humiliate — and finally to control,” said Mouna Khaity, a health and gender researcher who lived through the Syrian government’s five-year siege of Eastern Ghouta, an area near Damascus.ImageSyrians displaced from Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus,  waiting to receive food at a shelter in Horjelli, Syria, in 2018.Credit...Hassan Ammar/Associated PressDepriving a residential area of food while bombarding it serves not only to flush out combatants, she said, but to communicate to everyone trapped inside: “You are not an equal human to me. You don’t deserve to eat, drink, have medicine or even breathe!”After they surrounded Mariupol last month, Russian forces cut off the city from everything it needed to live, the mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said on Ukrainian national television. They also destroyed the city’s power plants, cutting off electricity for residents as temperatures froze, Mr. Boychenko said, and then the water and gas, essential for cooking and heating.Some civilians managed to flee, making harrowing journeys through destroyed streets and Russian checkpoints. But about 160,000 people are believed to still be trapped inside the city, Mr. Boychenko said, and more than two dozen buses sent days ago to evacuate them had not been able to enter the city because of Russian shelling.On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ceasing relief operations in Mariupol because the warring parties could not guarantee the safety of aid workers.ImageResidents lined up for hot food in an improvised bomb shelter in Mariupol on March 7.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAlmost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed there, the mayor estimated, but the figures could not be confirmed because of the difficulty of getting information.Russian forces are in control of parts of Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine told a group of independent Russian journalists on Sunday. But the center of the city continues to hold, according to Ukrainian and British military assessments.An aide to the mayor, Pyotr Andryuschenko, told The New York Times that an estimated 3,000 Ukrainian fighters from the Azov Battalion were defending the city against about 14,000 Moscow-backed soldiers.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 11:43 a.m. ET45 minutes ago45 minutes agoThe war is reshaping how Europe’s governments spend.Russian forces arrest an occupied city’s education chief during a struggle over changing the curriculum.Even with signs of progress in peace talks, the fighting continued on several fronts.When the siege began, one Mariupol resident, Kristina, said she, her husband and two children camped out in the entryway of their building, hoping it would provide better shelter and protection than their apartment.Her husband, a business analyst, ventured out to find water and she cooked on an open fire.

Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, is devising Germany’s first national security strategy. And Nancy Faeser, in charge of homeland security, is organizing the welcome for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees.As war rages in Ukraine, a mere 10-hour drive from Berlin, it is the first time that Germany has all three national security positions filled by women, putting them on the frontline of both a cultural and a strategic revolution in their country.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Security lies in the hands of strong women in this government,” Mr. Scholz, 63, said when he presented his cabinet to the country in November — the first featuring as many women as men. The shift would have been momentous at any time, but is now especially notable as Germany faces its biggest security crisis since the Cold War: the Russian aggression in Ukraine that has unsettled Europe and jolted the NATO alliance to attention.Mr. Scholz’s conservative predecessor, Angela Merkel, made history when she became the first female chancellor in 2005, inspiring women and girls across the country, and earning praise for her leadership in Europe, not least after uniting others on the continent behind tough sanctions on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014.ImageThe remnants of a destroyed Russian tank on the northern outskirts of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, on Friday.Credit... Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesChristoph Heusgen, a veteran German diplomat who was Ms. Merkel’s national security adviser for 12 years, summed up his former boss’s secret of success in foreign policy and security matters: “No vanity, no testosterone.”But unlike Mr. Scholz, a Social Democrat, Ms. Merkel never achieved gender parity in her government. Only now, a quarter-century after Madeleine K. Albright, who died last week at 84, became America’s first female secretary of state, does Germany have its first female foreign minister and its first female interior minister. (There have been two female defense ministers already.)AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySome spy an analogy to the foreign-policy shift, which had for so long eluded the traditionally more pro-military Christian Democrats of Ms. Merkel. Just like it took a male chancellor to achieve gender parity in government, it took a progressive government to announce €100 billion to revamp the German military, said Roderich Kiesewetter, a conservative lawmaker and former soldier.Had his own party announced this, “the result would have been turmoil, public unrest, demonstrations — the whole so-called peace movement would call us warmongers,” Mr. Kiesewetter said.Instead, it falls to Ms. Lambrecht, a onetime supporter of that peace movement who joined Mr. Scholz’s Social Democrats in the 1980s when she marched against nuclear power and in favor of disarmament, to buy armed drones and a new generation of fighter jets that can drop nuclear bombs.Ms. Lambrecht, a 56-year-old former justice minister who is considered to be on the left of her party and has no previous experience of the military, in many ways personifies the far-reaching change in the German mind-set since Russia attacked Ukraine in February.ImageA receiving station for Nord Stream 2  in Lubmin, on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany. Before the war, Ms. Lambrecht’s Social Democrats had not wanted to drag the giant oil pipeline into the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Credit...John Macdougall/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBefore the war started, Ms. Lambrecht spoke for many Social Democrats when she insisted “not to draw” the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany “into the Ukraine conflict.” She defended Germany’s ban on arms shipments into conflict zones, offering Ukraine 5,000 helmets and a field hospital instead.Now, she proudly describes Germany as one of the biggest supplier of arms to Ukraine and defends plans to raise military spending to beyond 2 percent of gross domestic product.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We have to say goodbye to the idea that we live in a peaceful Europe,” Ms. Lambrecht said in a recent interview. “The threats are coming closer — they have come closer. The idea that there are borders that are accepted by all, that’s over. We saw how Putin is trampling all over international law.”She is candid about her own — and her country’s — belated pivot, something that observers say gives her credibility with those who still need convincing.“If I’m honest, I could not have imagined it before this brutal offensive war,” she said. “There is a before and an after.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 11:43 a.m. ET45 minutes ago45 minutes agoThe war is reshaping how Europe’s governments spend.Russian forces arrest an occupied city’s education chief during a struggle over changing the curriculum.Even with signs of progress in peace talks, the fighting continued on several fronts.When Ms. Lambrecht meets President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan; Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III; and members of Congress in Washington this week, she has one message for them: “We stand by our allies’ side and are conscious of the responsibility that we must and want to take on in this alliance. We are not just talking, but taking concrete measures.”One of those measures is to develop a national security strategy, Germany’s first, and the woman in charge of it is the foreign minister, Ms. Baerbock. Hawkish on Russia, she is determined to enshrine the current consensus on a more muscular and values-based foreign policy into a doctrine that endures.ImageAnnalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, center in black, visiting Shyrokyne, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, last month.Credit...Pool photo by Bernd Von JutrczenkaThis consensus is fragile, she noted.“If there hadn’t been the war, some of these decisions may never have been taken,” she said. “I want to make sure that we won’t forget in four months or even in four years why we made some of these decisions.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFor Ms. Baerbock, a member of the Green Party, it is not just a policy shift. It is a shift in how Germany sees and defines itself, no longer hiding behind its history but actively trying to shape the future.“It’s good to know history, but we cannot formulate the future only with the past,” she said. “As Germans, we have a special responsibility, but we have to work for the future.”At 41, Ms. Baerbock represents a new generation in German politics, one that came of age after the Berlin Wall fell. Like others in her generation, she is not afraid to talk about “leading” or “führen” — long a taboo in a Germany traumatized by the memory of its onetime Führer, Hitler.As a mother of two young children, Ms. Baerbock has personalized and humanized war diplomacy almost every day, always with an eye toward the future.“I grew up in a united European Union at peace, and as a western German it’s my responsibility to ensure the same for my children and grandchildren,” she said. “I actually have the responsibility to lead so that other generations in neighboring countries can also live in peace. And this is a change in identity.”Image Nancy Faeser, the interior minister, center, during a visit to an arrival center for refugees from Ukraine at Berlin Tegel, a former airport, last week.Credit...Clemens Bilan/EPA, via ShutterstockOpenly advocating a “feminist foreign policy,” Ms. Baerbock described her arrival as “a culture shock” for Germany’s male-dominated security community, something she shares with Nancy Faeser, the interior minister.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“It should be normal in the year 2022 that women are heading security agencies,” Ms. Faeser said in an interview. “It’s an important and good signal for Germany.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks.

On Monday, Mr. Biden stood by his remark, but said it was a personal expression of his “moral outrage.”And long overdue, some officials in her ministry add privately. In 2018, Ms. Faeser’s predecessor appointed only men to eight junior minister posts. The photograph of the nine men caused such an outcry that the ministry had to take it off the website at the time.A more gender-balanced lens on security is not just a question of fairness but good policy, said Ms. Faeser, who is managing the arrival of some 250,000 refugees from Ukraine — a number expected eventually to exceed the 1.2 million who came from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan in 2015 and 2016.“One priority is taking care of young women and children,” Ms. Faeser said. “Many of these women and children are traumatized not just from war but because they had to leave behind their husbands, fathers and sons. They need special care. Because so many women are coming alone, we are particularly vigilant.”Ms. Faeser has increased the number of police officers at train stations where refugees arrive to guard against human traffickers and sexual predators.When she is not planning how to welcome refugees or promoting a joint system of registering and distributing them between the 27 E.U. countries, Ms. Faeser’s job also includes keeping watch on critical infrastructure at risk from Russian cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. Germany has a sizable Russian-German community.ImageRefugees from Ukraine in Przemysl, Poland, waiting to travel to Germany this month. Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times“Ever since the illegal war started, we have seen Russian disinformation campaigns peddling the narrative that Ukraine has to be liberated,” Ms. Faeser said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOne of the most dramatic cases of fake news meant to stir Russian sympathy was a homemade video showing a woman recounting in tears how a Russian teenager had been beaten to death by Ukrainian refugees.“The video was fake, that is confirmed,” Ms. Faeser said. An expert in the issues of far-right extremism and far-right terrorism, she is no stranger to online propaganda and incitement to hatred.Ms. Faeser has so far been largely spared the sexist commentary her fellow female ministers have received. Ms. Baerbock, who ran as the Green candidate for chancellor before joining Mr. Scholz’s government in a coalition, was the target of several online disinformation campaigns, some of them orchestrated from Russian accounts.But with the revival of Germany’s military now in the headlines, it is Ms. Lambrecht, the defense minister, who has become the primary target.“Does this minister know how to do war?” Germany’s best-selling tabloid, Bild, recently asked.For now, Ms. Lambrecht takes the criticism lightly. “Honestly, I’m pretty busy and don’t have time to think about why some things are written about me,” she said before boarding her plane to Washington. “My job is to make the military significantly better. Judge me at the end.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/world/29germany-women-security-01/29germany-women-security-01-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

Following the ruling, Mr. Hernández’s legal team said that it is looking at the possibility of applying for a court injunction, though it was unclear what legal recourse the lawyers have left to avoid their client’s trial abroad.“What was declared today is the extradition. He was not declared guilty or innocent,” Tomás Zambrano, head of Mr. Hernandez’s National Party in congress, told the local television station HCH after the ruling. “As nationalists and Hondurans, we express our solidarity with the family of president Hernández.”Sporadic fireworks went off in different parts of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa as some residents celebrated the decision against a deeply unpopular former president, under whose rule the country became more authoritarian and corrupt.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyU.S. officials have accused Mr. Hernández, who stepped down in January after his party suffered an overwhelming defeat in the November general election, of colluding with drug cartels to ship tons of cocaine to the United States in return for financial support for his political party, according to the extradition request.U.S. officials said that Honduras emerged, under Mr. Hernández, as one of the largest drugs transit hubs in Latin America and that the former president allowed cartels to penetrate the highest echelons of his country’s government.Collusion with cartels has worsened Honduras’ already chronic corruption and undermined its democracy, contributing to mass migration out of the country and leading to Mr. Hernández’s party’s loss at the polls last year.His successor, Xiomara Castro, has promised to overhaul what she called a “narco state” built by Mr. Hernández.Honduran police officers surrounded the house of the former president on Feb. 15, just minutes after Ms. Castro’s officials said they had received the extradition request.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe former president was led from his home in shackles later that day, shocking a Central American nation accustomed to officials operating with impunity. As spontaneous celebrations broke out that evening in Tegucigalpa, Ms. Castro’s supporters chanted “Juancho is going to New York,” calling Mr. Hernández by his nickname.While Ms. Castro has moved swiftly against officials in the former administration who were implicated in crimes, she has so far shown little desire to punish allies, darkening the perception of her anti-corruption promises, said Honduran analysts.In a handwritten letter released by Mr. Hernández’s wife on social media on Monday, Mr. Hernández wrote that he is an innocent victim of revenge by the drug cartels, whose extradited members made false statements to U.S. prosecutors to punish him for his fight against organized crime.The letter also conveyed his resignation to a long term in prison. “I conclude that by facing three life sentences, I could become a dead man walking,” he wrote.The extradition request, presented to Honduras’s Supreme Court and seen by The New York Times, claims that Mr. Hernández participated in a “violent drug-trafficking conspiracy” that since 2004 has transported 500 tons of cocaine from Venezuela and Colombia to the United States via Honduras. The document claims that Mr. Hernández received millions of dollars in bribes for facilitating the shipments and shielding traffickers from prosecution.The former president’s brother, Juan Antonio Hernández, is serving a life sentence in the United States for cocaine trafficking. Another convicted cocaine trafficker who implicated the former president, Geovanny Fuentes, received a life sentence earlier this year.The looming extradition of Mr. Hernández could have regional consequences if the former president decides to negotiate with the federal prosecutors, said Joaquín Mejía, a Honduran human rights law expert.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“He was the kingpin in Honduras, but the drugs came from Colombia and Venezuela and passed on to Guatemala and Mexico,” he said, “creating a criminal structure involving high-level people from the economic and political sectors of all those countries.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/world/00HONDURAS-JOH-APPEAL2/00HONDURAS-JOH-APPEAL2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

Members of the delegations said they hoped not only to persuade Francis to become the first pope to apologize for the schools’ abuse, but also to travel to Canada to offer his apology to survivors and Indigenous communities in general.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Truth, justice and healing. We hope that the church can finally begin a meaningful and lasting reconciliation,” said Cassidy Caron, president of the Métis National Council. The hourlong meeting had been “comfortable,” she told reporters in St. Peter’s Square, adding that the pope had listened and “nodded along” when three survivors of the schools “told their truths.”“I felt some sorrow in his reaction,” she said.ImageMembers of the Métis Indigenous delegation from Canada with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Monday.Credit...Vatican MediaMartha Greig, a survivor and member of the Inuit delegation, said she hoped the pope would visit Canada. “I think it would mean more to the former residential school students and the families.”Over the years, Francis and other popes have expressed sorrow and sadness for the survivors of Canada’s residential schools, but all have stopped short of apologizing or seeking forgiveness.“It’s been a very, very long wait,” Wilton Littlechild, the former grand chief of the Confederacy of Treaty Six First Nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan, said last week, before leaving for Rome. “I keep hope and pray that he does come here and say ‘I’m sorry’ to survivors. I think that will change our whole country.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe legacy of the residential school system has become Canada’s national shame. From the 1880s through the 1990s, at least 150,000 ​Indigenous children, including Mr. Littlechild and others in the delegations, were forcibly separated from their families by the Canadian government and sent to residential boarding schools, often far from their communities.At the schools, which were mostly run for the government by the Catholic Church, sexual, physical and emotional abuse were commonplace, as was violence. The former head of the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Murray Sinclair, estimates that more than 6,000 children died or vanished over the decades that the schools were in operation.ImageA memorial in British Columbia outside the former Kamloops Indian Residential School, where the remains of children were discovered last spring.Credit...Amber Bracken for The New York TimesThe schools were ​intended to sever the children from their culture, language and religion. Following extensive hearings, the commission called the school system a “conscious policy of cultural genocide.”The horror surrounding the schools intensified last year after announcements by three Indigenous communities that ground-penetrating radar had revealed signs of many hundreds of unmarked graves containing human remains, most likely those of children, at the sites of former schools in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Multiple survivors had testified at commission hearings that children died in the schools and were buried on the grounds.Sign up for the Canada Letter Newsletter  Back stories and analysis from our Canadian correspondents, plus a handpicked selection of our recent Canada-related coverage.

Searches for more remains are now underway at former school sites throughout most of the vast country.Francis responded to the discovery of remains in June, within days after a First Nation announced finding 215 possible human remains in the grounds around the former Kamloops Residential School in British Columbia. He said he joined “the Canadian Bishops and the whole Catholic Church in Canada in expressing my closeness to the Canadian people, who have been traumatized by this shocking news.” He also announced in June that he would hold these meetings with Indigenous delegates. And in October, the Vatican announced that Francis had “indicated his willingness” to visit Canada.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA papal apology in Canada “would be one more of those steps forward along our path for true reconciliation,” Ms. Caron said. “While the time for acknowledgment, apology and atonement is long overdue, it is never too late to do the right thing,” she added.The brutal discoveries have hardened the resolve of many Indigenous people to hold the country, and the churches that operated the schools, accountable. They have also increased pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fulfill his promise to put in place the 94 recommendations of the commission, including demanding a papal apology in Canada.ImageOn the grounds of the Mohawk Institute, a former residential school in Brantford, Ontario, last November, where ground-penetrating radar was used to search for human remains.Credit...Tara Walton for The New York TimesIn 2017, Mr. Trudeau personally appealed to Pope Francis for an apology during a meeting at the Vatican. But that was followed the next year by a letter from the pope rejecting the idea, without explaining why.There is speculation that Mr. Trudeau may have increased the pope’s hesitation to give an apology by demanding one. “I think that in the Vatican, they haven’t been delighted with this political pressure from a national government to apologize for something that is a very complex history,” said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University.The Protestant churches that ran just under a third of the schools, along with the government, long ago apologized and fulfilled their obligation to pay reparations under a class-action settlement in 2006. About 4.7 billion Canadian dollars, most of it from the government, has been paid to survivors and spent on projects, including the commission.But the Catholic Church, through the Canadian Bishops’ Conference, has fulfilled fewer of its legal obligations to survivors, failing to pay most of its share of the reparations, which amounts to 25 million Canadian dollars.

The Reverend Richard Gagnon, the Catholic Archbishop of Winnipeg, who was present, described the encounter as a “listening session.”Natan Obed, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national Inuit organization, said that the visiting delegates and the pope had spoken about faith, and the positive role the church could “play in reconciliation and helping communities move forward.”The last three popes have not been shy about asking for forgiveness from other groups. In 2015, while in Bolivia, Francis apologized for the “grave sins” that were “committed against the native people of America in the name of God.” Two years later, he apologized for the silence of church leaders in the Rwandan genocide of 1994.Twelve years ago, Pope Benedict XVI wrote a letter to Irish Catholics saying he was “truly sorry” about the abuses suffered by Irish children, including those who were abused in residential institutions.ImageClothing on crosses along a highway in British Columbia last year, symbolizing  children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.Credit...Amber Bracken for The New York TimesAnd in 2000, Pope John Paul II delivered a sweeping apology for the church’s errors over 2,000 years, including religious intolerance toward Jews, women, Indigenous peoples and the poor.Canada’s Indigenous people have received expressions of sympathy from Francis and Benedict that stopped short of apologizing. In 2009, Benedict  expressed “sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church” in Canada and offered “his sympathy and prayerful solidarity,” adding that “acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society.”Originally scheduled for December, the Pope’s meetings with the Indigenous groups were delayed because of the pandemic. After meeting with the delegations representing the Métis and the Inuit on Monday, Francis will meet with the delegations representing the First Nations on Thursday, before holding a culminating session with all three groups on Friday.","null"

He has clocked 17 phone conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin in the past four months, one personal meeting in Moscow and so many hours of discussion with his own aides that he has had scant time for the small matter of a presidential election in less than two weeks.In the same period, he has spoken 25 times to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and met with him in Kyiv and Brussels. On Feb. 25, he spoke twice in a single day to the Ukrainian leader, something he also did with Mr. Putin on Feb 11. All with a view, Mr. Macron says, “to securing a cease-fire and then the total withdrawal of troops.”If diplomacy is measured by perseverance, Mr. Macron is a supreme diplomat. If it is measured by effective realism, the verdict appears less favorable. Up to now, on the face of it, he has achieved very little through his 42 calls and three meetings. The war is into its second month with an untold number of dead. More than 3.7 million Ukrainian refugees have fled westward.Mr. Zelensky, to judge by a recent interview in The Economist, has been underwhelmed. Asked about Mr. Macron’s statement at a NATO meeting last week that delivering tanks to Ukraine represented a red line not be crossed, Mr. Zelensky said France took this position because “they are afraid of Russia. And that’s it.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn relations with Russia, it is less fear that seems to inhabit Mr. Macron than a kind of romantic fascination with the country and its culture, as well as an intellectual conviction that Europe will not be stable until Russia is integrated into some new security architecture that reflects the Cold War’s end.ImagePresident Vladimir Putin of Russia meeting with President Macron in Moscow in February, weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Credit...Sputnik/via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Macron returned to the theme of reimagining European security in an interview with France 3 TV on Sunday: “The United States and Russia structured the world during the Cold War. We are no longer in the Cold War,” he said. It is Europeans, not Americans, who “live beside Russia,” and so “we need a defense policy and we need to define a security architecture for ourselves and not delegate that task.”In some ways, the war in Ukraine has validated Mr. Macron’s long-held convictions. Germany in the past several weeks has effectively shifted from a pacifist postwar power to one prepared to spend heavily on defense to revamp its armed forces. That in turn means that a pet phrase of Mr. Macron’s — “Europe puissance,” or “European power” — is no longer a pipe dream. Europe will look different if Germany truly stiffens its military backbone.The French people appear to have few misgivings about Mr. Macron’s diplomatic striving, despite the fact that he has devoted little time to the campaign and has refused to debate other candidates.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThey see, rather, a leader assuming his responsibilities on the world stage. France currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member European Union, giving Mr. Macron a double reason to lead Europe’s diplomatic efforts — a role the president has said falls naturally to him given Britain’s exit from the European Union and Germany’s leadership transition.ImagePresident Macron with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Kyiv in February, the day after the French leader met with President Putin in Moscow.Credit...Pool photo by Thibault CamusAlthough he has fallen to about 28.5 percent of the vote in the most recent polls, down from 30 percent, Mr. Macron is still four percentage points up on his prewar average. His main rival, Marine Le Pen of the hard-right National Rally, has surged of late to 20 percent, up 2.5 percent in a week, mainly at the expense of the upstart hard-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, who is now at 11.5 percent.The election campaign has been curiously low-key, absent Mr. Macron’s participation in debates, with no major policy theme and a widespread perception that the incumbent has victory secured. On the other hand, the process has been so opaque that Philippe Labro, an author and a longtime observer of French politics, said in a brief conversation that “a surprise may still be lurking.”In all his diplomatic efforts, Mr. Macron has consulted closely with President Biden. There has been little daylight between them, with the French president appearing to play good cop to Mr. Biden’s bad cop in dealing with Mr. Putin.But Mr. Biden’s improvised comment about Mr. Putin at the end of a speech this weekend in Poland — “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power” — appeared to open up some discord.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. Russia said that it would sharply “reduce military activity” near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. The announcement was the first sign of progress to emerge from peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.Biden’s comments. During a speech in Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said that President Vladimir V. Putin “cannot remain in power,” sending U.S. officials scrambling to walk back the ad-lib. On Monday, Mr. Biden stood by his remark, but said it was a personal expression of his “moral outrage.”“I wouldn’t use this sort of words,” Mr. Macron said in the Sunday interview, insisting that he still hoped to secure a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops. “If we want to do this, we must not escalate, either in words or actions.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Macron has been tough at times with Mr. Putin. After a March 3 call when Mr. Putin described Mr. Zelensky’s government as “Nazis,” Mr. Macron replied that this was “lies.” He continued: “Either you are telling yourself stories, or you’re looking for a pretext. What you’re saying does not conform with reality.”ImagePresident Macron, center, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Great Britain and President Biden of the United States in Brussels last week.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesAt other times, Mr. Macron has appeared to have difficulty confronting reality himself. As a former K.G.B. officer, Mr. Putin was trained in the art of seduction, in persuading his interlocutors that he liked them, so that they would reveal themselves more completely. Mr. Macron is also a man who likes to think his charm will win people over. He tried, for example, to get close to President Trump to secure concessions that were never forthcoming.On the plane back from Moscow last month, the French president said he had secured promises from Mr. Putin that Russian troops would be withdrawn from Belarus after a planned military exercise, that nuclear weapons would never be positioned there, and that Russia would engage seriously with the Minsk peace process aimed at resolving the conflict over two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.Two weeks later, Mr. Putin recognized the independence of the breakaway regions, using an “invitation” from them as a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine that he called “a special military operation.” Russian troops were not withdrawn from Belarus.“Yes, there was duplicity,” Mr. Macron said on Feb. 24, the day of the invasion.Yet he and Mr. Putin have spoken seven times since then.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/28/world/28Ukraine-Macron1/28Ukraine-Macron1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

For hours he had hacked away at the coal in the dark tunnel, terrified it might collapse on him, and now he was relieved to step back into sunlight.Mr. Hadi, a 29-year-old former government soldier, was among thousands who flocked to northern Afghanistan’s notoriously dangerous mines after the Taliban seized power last year — desperate to scrape out a living amid an economy in ruins.The backbreaking work offers a few dollars a day, just enough to buy bread and tea for his family to survive. But it comes at a steep price: Since he arrived in October, three mines on this mountain have caved in. The latest collapse last month killed 10 miners, all of whom suffocated after being trapped inside a mine shaft for days.“That night I wanted to leave this job, to never come back to the mines,” Mr. Hadi said. “But then I went home and saw there was nothing to eat.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFor more than six months, Afghanistan has been gripped by a devastating economic crisis that has wiped out incomes, sent food prices soaring and left millions hungry. Now, desperate to make ends meet, many Afghans are going to increasingly drastic lengths to survive.ImageThe Chinarak mine, in the hills of Baghlan Province north of the Afghan capital. ImagePeople at work at the Chinarak coal mine. Sure-footed donkeys provide the link between freshly dug coal and the trucks that wait on the road below. Families in rural areas have repaid debts with children they cannot afford to feed, selling them to better-off families or local bosses. In the northwestern city of Herat, men have sold their kidneys on the black market. And along the Iranian border, thousands looking for work abroad have endured brutal beatings by security forces.In the Chinarak mines of Baghlan Province, a mountainous slice of northern Afghanistan, three times as many men have come to work in recent months than before the Taliban takeover, according to mine operators. They are former soldiers and policemen, NGO workers and shopkeepers, among the millions who have lost their incomes in recent months.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFor decades, the informal mining operation has been a risky option for impoverished villagers desperate to earn a few dollars a day. Around 200 people have died in the mines since coal was discovered here 50 years ago, according to village elders.Reporting From AfghanistanInside the Fall of Kabul: ​The Taliban took the Afghan capital with a speed that shocked the world. Our reporter and photographer witnessed it.On Patrol: A group of Times journalists spent 12 days with a Taliban police unit in Kabul. Here is what they saw.Face to Face: ​​A Times reporter who served as a Marine in Afghanistan returned to interview a Taliban commander he once fought.A Photographer’s Journal: A look at 20 years of war in Afghanistan, chronicled through one Times photographer’s lens.But the mines have become even more deadly since the Taliban seized power, miners say. Unlike the previous government, the Taliban have not supplied engineers to monitor toxic gas, or timber to support tunnels that stretch for hundreds of yards. The result is a deadly combination of less structurally sound mines and inexperienced miners who cannot spot signs of danger.“The economic situation is forcing everyone here, but they know they could die. It’s more dangerous than ever,” said one miner, Baz Mohammad, 35, who has worked in the mines since he was 15. “If I had some money, I wouldn’t stay here for another second.”The work at Chinarak begins at dawn, when the taste of smoke from wood-burning stoves hangs heavy in the air and the morning fog paints the foothills in a cloudlike haze. Carrying shovels and pickaxes, miners make their way down the winding path of reddish clay to the coal-filled mountain.ImageSome of the miners toiling at the Chinarak mines are just children. ImageAfghanistan’s economic collapse has driven three times as many people as usual to seek work in the mines, despite the dangers there. From the base of the mountain, a trail of blackened earth — a sign of coal — zigzags across its face like a treasure map. Strapping on headlamps, the men duck into mine openings scattered across the hillside and crawl through subterranean tunnels that stretch as far as 300 yards.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySitting on a boulder outside one mine, Zahir Kazimi, 33, said he could barely move his body after his first day at the mines in January. A tailor by trade, Mr. Kazimi went to work in sewing shops at the age of 13 — determined to save up the money to marry a girl he liked. A decade later, he married and opened his own tailor shop. He was happy then, he said.But after the Taliban seized power, his once steady stream of clients dried up, and soon his savings did, too. So he took his brother’s donkey to the mines and joined the throng of sweaty men with black dust caked into their skin. Twelve hours later, he returned home with his back aching and cursing himself for getting married at all — if he were single, he would not have to earn so much to feed four mouths at home.“If you come here and work, you can get some money to buy food for your family. If not, they will go hungry,” Mr. Kazimi said. “There is no other way to go. We must work.”Standing outside a mine’s entrance, Mr. Hadi, the former soldier, wiped his hand on his shirt and looked at his calloused palm. His father, a farmer, always chided him to go to school as a child, dreaming that one day his son could become a district governor or a commander. For a while, Mr. Hadi hoped he could, too. At 18, he joined the Afghan National Army and earned a decent salary.ImageMany workers live in constant fear of dying from toxic gas, or from tunnel collapses like the one that trapped and killed 10 miners in February.But jobless and broke after the former government collapsed, he sold the large carpet in his living room and used the money to buy a donkey he could take to the mines. Inside the dark tunnels, he works through the pain that shoots through his back and arms as he slams a pickax into the wall of coal over and over and over again.The labor is grueling, he says, but even worse is the fear: the fear of choking on toxic gas, the fear that the rock hitting your back is the start of a collapse, the fear of being buried alive with no hope of rescue.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Every time I go in the tunnel, I’m afraid,” Mr. Hadi said. “When I’m picking coal, I’m always telling myself this is the last one for today.”By midday at Chinarak, the mines are buzzing with hundreds of miners — some old men in their 60s, some children barely 10. As they work, the sounds echo down the mountain: the thuds of men dropping satchels of coal on the ground. The hiss of coal pouring out of the bags. The clucks from children coaxing donkeys carrying loads of coal down the mountain.The coal is unloaded onto trucks that head down the rough road to a Taliban checkpoint, a single-story building that overlooks a large riverbed and the mountain range’s snow-covered peaks. The building once belonged to businessmen who operated these mines in mafia-like arrangements with the previous government. At that time, trucks of coal leaving the mines would be taxed first by those companies, and then again by the Taliban, who levied informal taxes to fund their insurgency.ImageA weighing and taxing station manned by Taliban fighters and officials for coal trucks near the Chinarak mine in Baghlan.ImageAbid Atullah, left, and Taliban guards at the weighing and taxing station for coal trucks near the Chinarak mine.Since seizing power, Taliban officials say they have driven out those strongmen and “nationalized” the mining industry. Abid Atullah, the Taliban’s manager of mines in the Nahrain district, said they collected $16,000 to $30,000 in tax revenue from the Chinarak mines each day — a modest but welcome revenue stream for the cash-strapped government.Still, miners complain about the lack of government support. For months, their petitions to the local government to provide engineers, oxygen tanks, toxic-gas meters and wooden support beams have gone unanswered, they say. Some who informally run the mines have purchased the timber themselves — cutting miners’ daily wages by around 40 percent to afford it. Others have forgone it, forcing miners to dig narrower tunnels that are harder to work in and not structurally sound.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe collapse of a mine last month epitomized the heightened risks: Miners said inexperienced workers had extended the tunnel too far, and that there weren’t any beams to support it. For two days, nearly everyone on the mountain helped try to break through the wall of earth that trapped nearly two dozen miners inside, driven by the men’s muffled cries for help. Seventeen hours in, their voices faded as the oxygen ran out. No one made it.Their fate haunts the men who have to keep returning.ImageWorkers say that since the Afghan government fell to the Taliban, they don’t get enough wooden beams to support mine tunnels that grow ever-longer.ImageTaza, second from right, is a former policeman who had his lungs seize up from breathing toxic gas in the tunnels.Emerging from a mine entrance, Taza, 30, slammed the bag of coal on the ground and let out a loud cough. A policeman under the former government, and a father of six, he began working in the mines in September, despite all the horrific stories he grew up with about how many ways there were to die there.Weeks later, he learned the dangers for himself: Inside a tunnel, he began to feel hot and his head oddly heavy. Within minutes his lungs seized up — a symptom of inhaling the toxic gas that was slowly filling the tunnel. Dropping his sack of coal, he dashed to the mine’s entrance and collapsed on the ground.A few days later, he went back to the mountain.“I don’t have any other option,” he said. “My kids are hungry.”ImageWorking the cramped tunnels.

The jovial candid photos of the leaders and their high-flown speeches amply testified to the event’s momentousness.But the real business of the hastily arranged summit was urgent diplomacy, spurred by the war in Ukraine and the pending nuclear agreement with Iran: The United States wanted to press the other five countries to take a harder line against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, while they in turn wanted American assurances that Iran would be constrained.The 18-hour summit produced no concrete public results, but there were hints of a behind-the-scenes thaw between the United Arab Emirates and the United States after weeks of growing tensions. Washington has been frustrated by the Emirates’ neutral response to the Russian invasion, while Emirati officials were angry at what they see as American indifference to Iranian threats to Emirati security.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe summit notably brought Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and his counterpart from the United Arab Emirates, Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, face to face, and their evident camaraderie raised hopes of a more substantial breakthrough when Mr. Blinken meets the de facto Emirati leader, Mohammed bin Zayed, on Tuesday in Morocco.Mr. Blinken and Sheikh Abdullah displayed visible warmth to each other, two officials who attended the conference said. One photograph of a behind-the-scenes meeting appeared to show the two men sharing a joke, prompting smiles from other participants.ImageMr. Blinken with Sheikh Abdullah on Monday.Credit...Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin“Everybody got a little bit of what they wanted,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist. “The photo that we saw the most is Sheikh Abdullah having a nice conversation and a laugh with Blinken.”Beyond the apparent entente between the Americans and the Emiratis, the summit also allowed Israel and the four Arab countries to deepen their coordination on shared security threats, intelligence gathering, energy concerns and food supplies, according to officials who attended the summit.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIt allowed the five Middle Eastern states — Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Israel — to collectively encourage the United States to remain engaged in the region, despite its focus on Russia and China. And it gave them the chance to lobby Mr. Blinken not to lift sanctions on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a key Iranian military force, in exchange for Iran’s curbing its nuclear ambitions.“What we are doing here is making history — building a new regional architecture based on progress, technology, religious tolerance, security and intelligence cooperation,” said the Israeli foreign minister, Yair Lapid, who organized the conference.“This new architecture, the shared capabilities we are building,” he added, “intimidates and deters our common enemies, first and foremost Iran and its proxies.”Perhaps the most significant aspect of the summit was the fact that it took place at all.When Israel signed normalization agreements with the U.A.E., Bahrain and Morocco in 2020, with the help of the Trump administration, it was unclear how sustainable or meaningful the relationships would be. The fact that all three gathered for the first time on Israeli soil, nearly two years later, shows how cemented those ties have become.The presence of Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in 1979, also highlighted how the 2020 agreements have encouraged Cairo to breathe new life into a relationship it had long neglected.“This is our first time” in Israel, Sheikh Abdullah said in his closing statement. “If we are curious sometimes, and we want to know things and learn, it’s because although Israel has been part of this region for a very long time, we’ve not known each other. So it’s time to catch up.”ImageFlags of the participating nations flying over the resort on Sunday.Credit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesIn that spirit, the participants confirmed that they would try to meet in a different country each year, and said they wanted to welcome more countries to the future gatherings.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut in private, the participants discussed their differences as well as their points of unity, including on Iran and the fallout from the Ukraine war.The Emirates was frustrated by a perceived lack of American engagement after recent attacks by Iranian-backed Yemeni militants, the Houthis, on the Emirates and its ally, Saudi Arabia. The Emiratis, like the Israelis, also fear that American-backed efforts to persuade Iran to curb its nuclear program — negotiations are taking place in Vienna — won’t do enough to limit other kinds of Iranian aggression across the Middle East.American officials felt betrayed by the Emirati decision to abstain from a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn the Russian invasion, and frustrated that the Emirates’ ignored American requests to increase its oil production to make the world less reliant on Russian fuel supplies.The Emirates also raised eyebrows in Washington by maintaining warm ties with Russia — Sheikh Abdullah himself met with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow this month — and by reviving ties with Syria: Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, visited Abu Dhabi this month, undermining American efforts to keep him estranged internationally.For its part, Iran called the gathering an “evil conference” and a “betrayal of Palestinian aspirations for freedom.”“Any measures to normalize and establish relations with Zionist terrorists and occupiers of Jerusalem is a stab in the back of Palestinian people,” Saeed Khatibzadeh, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said, according to official Iranian media.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe summit did confirm that to a growing number of Arab states the lack of a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was no longer an obstacle to a partnership with Israel, even if such a partnership is still opposed by a majority of Arab civilians.Mr. Blinken and three of the four Arab ministers used their closing remarks to restate their countries’ backing for a two-state solution to the Palestinian question. But the absence of the Palestinian leadership from the discussion highlighted how Israel’s ties with the wider Arab world have become divorced from Israeli-Palestinian relations.On a hill opposite the hotel where the summit was held, protesters tried to draw attention to the Palestinians. One group held a banner that said: “Haven’t you forgotten someone?”The decision to hold the summit in the tiny, remote desert town of Sde Boker, rather than in Jerusalem, was nevertheless a reminder that the status of Jerusalem remains a highly sensitive issue for the Arab countries that participated.ImageThe remote location helped avoid the thorny topic of the status of Jerusalem. Credit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesWhile they may be prepared to work with Israel, analysts say, they still want to avoid any gesture that symbolically undermines Palestinian hopes of statehood, including a future capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in 1967.But Sde Boker, the final home of Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who is buried nearby, has its own meaning. Ben-Gurion saw the establishment of desert towns like Sde Boker as an important emblem of the Zionist dream of resettling the land of Israel.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThose themes have particular resonance today, given recent tensions between nearby Bedouin communities and their Jewish neighbors in the Negev. Arab Bedouins demonstrated in large numbers in January to protest Israeli government-backed attempts to plant trees on desert land that the Bedouin claim as their own.To guests staying this weekend at the Kedma Hotel, where the summit was taking place, the meeting was simply a charming surprise. Oren and Meital Dror, an Israeli couple celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary, were swimming in the pool just hours before the ministers arrived.“An exciting experience,” said Oren Dror, a 42-year-old entrepreneur. “We will remember it for years.”But, if he were alive today, “no one would be more stunned than Ben-Gurion himself” to see the summit, said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian and biographer of the Israeli leader.“He never believed in real peace with the Arabs,” Mr. Segev said of Ben-Gurion. “On the other hand, he always attributed greater significance to the Negev than to the West Bank and Gaza. So he may have said, as was his way, ‘I always told you so.’”ImageMeital and Oren Dror were among the last guests at the hotel on Sunday.Credit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesReporting was contributed by Rawan Sheikh Ahmad in Haifa, Israel; Myra Noveck in Jerusalem; Gabby Sobelman in Rehovot, Israel; Mona el-Naggar in Cairo; Aida Alami in Paris and Farnaz Fassihi in New York.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/28/world/28israel-diplo1/merlin_204658593_b51fe5f1-2ecd-4ad9-94dc-12376bb6c7f6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

On Tuesday, he escorted his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, to a memorial service at Westminster Abbey to celebrate the life of her late husband, Prince Philip.The prince’s very conspicuous public appearance on the queen’s arm, his first since Philip’s funeral last April, sent an unmistakable message of support by a 95-year-old mother for her disgraced son. But it struck some royal watchers as incongruous, given that she stripped Andrew of his military titles and all but banished him from public life after he was engulfed in the sexual abuse lawsuit.Andrew’s sudden re-emergence came days after a trouble-prone tour of the Caribbean by Prince William and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, during which the couple confronted a backlash over issues of racial justice and rising sentiment to cast off the queen as head of state in Jamaica and other former colonies.“It didn’t happen by happenstance,” Peter Hunt, a former royal correspondent for the BBC, said of Andrew’s role. “There must have been thinking behind it. You have to come to the conclusion that it was an opportunity for her to actively endorse her son, to point out that he hasn’t been found guilty of anything.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhile Andrew did not acknowledge guilt in the settlement with the woman, Virginia Giuffre, he agreed to pay her, as well as a charity “in support of victims’ rights,” a sum that British tabloids reported to be well in excess of $10 million. He commended Ms. Giuffre for her bravery in coming forward to talk about her treatment by the financier and sexual predator, Jeffrey Epstein, with whom the prince was friendly.Royal watchers often say the queen is especially fond of Andrew, whose past as a helicopter pilot echoes the military service of her husband.But after Andrew, 62, failed to persuade a federal judge in Manhattan to dismiss the lawsuit, Buckingham Palace moved to distance itself from him. It announced he would relinquish his military titles and royal charities, as well as the title, “His Royal Highness.” He would defend himself as a private citizen, the palace added, and would “continue not to undertake any public duties.”At the time, palace officials described this punishment as permanent, saying it had come after extensive deliberations within the family. There would be no avenue for Andrew, who is known as the Duke of York, to rehabilitate himself. It is not known whether Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, or his eldest son, Prince William, the second in line, were involved in planning the ceremony on Tuesday.“Did Charles and William attempt to intervene and did they fail? Or did they not bother to raise it?” Mr. Hunt said. “I would be amazed if nobody raised it,” he added, referring to the broader palace staff.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyUltimately, of course, the decision was up to the queen, for whom this was a deeply solemn, emotional ceremony. Philip, who died last April at 99, was buried in an austere funeral at Windsor Castle, under strict Covid restrictions, which limited attendance to 30 people and forced the queen to grieve for her husband of 73 years, masked and alone in a choir stall at St. George’s Chapel.Some Key Moments in Queen Elizabeth’s ReignCard 1 of 9Becoming queen. Following the death of King George VI, Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary ascended to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, at age 25. The coronation of the newly minted Queen Elizabeth II took place on June 2 the following year.A historic visit. On May 18, 1965, Elizabeth arrived in Bonn on the first state visit by a British monarch to Germany in more than 50 years. The trip formally sealed the reconciliation between the two nations following the world wars.First grandchild. In 1977, the queen stepped into the role of grandmother for the first time, after Princess Anne gave birth to a son, Peter. Elizabeth’s four children have given her a total of eight grandchildren, who have been followed by several great-grandchildren.Princess Diana’s death. In a rare televised broadcast ahead of Diana’s funeral in 1997, Queen Elizabeth remembered the Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris at age 36, as “an exceptional and gifted human being.”Golden jubilee. In 2002, celebrations to mark Elizabeth II's 50 years as queen culminated in a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace in the presence of 12,000 cheering guests, with an estimated one million more watching on giant screens set up around London.A trip to Ireland. In May 2011, the queen visited the Irish Republic, whose troubled relationship with the British monarchy spanned centuries. The trip, infused with powerful symbols of reconciliation, is considered one of the most politically freighted trips of Elizabeth’s reign.Breaking a record. As of 5:30 p.m. British time on Sept. 9, 2015, Elizabeth II became Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Elizabeth was 89 at the time, and had ruled for 23,226 days, 16 hours and about 30 minutes.Marking 70 years of marriage. On Nov. 20, 2017, the queen and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th anniversary, becoming the longest-married couple in royal history. The two wed in 1947, as the country and the world was still reeling from the atrocities of World War II.Losing her spouse. In 2021, Queen Elizabeth II bade farewell to Prince Philip, who died on April 9. An image of the queen grieving alone at the funeral amid coronavirus restrictions struck a chord with viewers at home following the event.Tuesday’s service featured a much larger guest list, including the filmmaker David Attenborough, who bonded with Philip over environmental issues. Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, who now live in California, did not attend.Whether the queen would make the trip from her residence at Windsor was unclear until the last minute. It was the first public occasion she has attended outside one of her residences since last October, when she abruptly canceled several appearances, suffering from what officials said was exhaustion. In February, Elizabeth tested positive for the coronavirus.The queen appeared frail but resolute at Westminster Abbey, a walking stick in her right hand as Andrew guided her from the Poets’ Yard entrance to the front row. The service was kept to a brisk, 45 minutes. Elizabeth looked teary-eyed at one point, but she stood up and down and sang several hymns.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/world/29UK-ROYALS-01/29UK-ROYALS-01-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

But rights groups and analysts have raised concerns that the mass arrests have little to do with the weekend’s killings and fear that the new measures will allow El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, to further consolidate power.The violence prompted a swift response from the Salvadoran government: Military and police forces surrounded neighborhoods, searching vehicles and frisking anyone seeking to enter or leave. El Salvador’s Parliament approved the emergency decree for 30 days, suspending some civil liberties guaranteed in the Constitution and giving the government the ability to make arbitrary arrests, tap phones without a court order and break up public assemblies.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBy Sunday evening, Salvadoran security forces said they had detained 576 people in several districts around the capital. Some people said they were not given even basic information why their loved ones were detained or where.“There is no great evidence that there is a connection between many of the detained people and the murders on Saturday,” said Tiziano Breda, a Central America analyst at the International Crisis Group, a think tank that analyzes global conflict and unrest.“Some of those jailed are aged gang members and have been inactive for a while. Others are not necessarily gang members,” he said. “It’s a stigmatized sweep up, where anyone who looks like a thug can be arrested.”ImageBy Sunday evening, Salvadoran security forces said they had detained 576 people in several districts around the capital, San Salvador.

The pastor, William Arias, had dedicated his life’s work to convincing gang members to reintegrate into society.

Local police officials told Eugenia that he had been charged with the crime of being part of an “illegal group” but did not provide details or evidence.“Now the police and the military are not asking anything,” said Eugenia, who, like everyone interviewed asked that her last name be withheld for fear of retaliation.“They are grabbing all the people,” she added.ImageA soldier guarding a crime scene in San Salvador on Sunday. Many have been killed in recent gang violence, prompting the government of El Salvador to impose a state of emergency.Credit...Salvador Melendez/Associated PressEl Salvador’s government went into overdrive to showcase its efforts, tweeting videos of security forces raiding homes in poor neighborhoods and arresting scores of people on the streets. Mr. Bukele implied on Twitter that there had been about 1,000 arrests since Sunday morning, adding to the 16,000 gang members who, he said, were already in prison and would also be punished for the weekend’s violence.The president said on Sunday that the government could extend the state of emergency beyond the 30 days approved by Parliament, stoking fears that the ruling could be used to expand the crackdown and arrest government critics.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The suspension of certain constitutional rights in El Salvador opens the door to all kinds of abuses,” Juan Pappier, a senior analyst at Human Rights Watch, said on Twitter on Monday.Mr. Bukele has faced criticism for using the military to interfere with the Legislature and for his decision last year to dismiss Supreme Court judges and the attorney general in what the opposition called an unconstitutional power grab. On Monday, the president — who has accused the United States of supporting the opposition in the past — seemed eager to fold the international community into his ongoing battle against the gangs.After saying on Twitter that he had ordered prisons to ration food to incarcerated gang members, Mr. Bukele issued a thinly veiled challenge to the United States: “And if the ‘international community’ is worried about their little angels, come and bring them food, because I will not take funding away from schools to feed these terrorists.”Such statements alarm the president’s critics, particularly after Mr. Bukele’s government pushed Parliament to propose a bill that human rights groups said could restrict the work of independent journalists and civil society groups if they receive funding or support from abroad. The proposed law is currently being debated and would force entities to register as foreign agents, with their funding subjected to a 40 percent tax.ImageA man being arrested in Santa Tecla, El Salvador, on Monday. Credit...Rodrigo Sura/EPA, via ShutterstockLast year, the United States accused Mr. Bukele of striking a secret deal with the country’s most fearsome gangs, such as MS-13. The Treasury Department in December sanctioned several top officials in Mr. Bukele’s government, accusing them of providing financial incentives, prostitutes and access to mobile phones to gang leaders imprisoned in Salvadoran jails in exchange for the gangs tamping down violence.Mr. Bukele is one of several Salvadoran presidents accused of striking such deals to bring crime down ahead of elections. The president campaigned on the promise of bringing law and order to El Salvador’s streets, some of the world’s most violent. Since taking office nearly three years ago he had seemed to be making good on that pledge.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut on Saturday the gangs killed at random: street vendors, people buying bread and taxi drivers. Analysts and an American official said Sunday that the government agreement with the gangs may be falling apart — the killing spree seemed to be pressure to renegotiate the terms of the purported arrangement.Mr. Bukele has denied that his government has struck a deal and instead said the lower levels of violence are the result of a secret security strategy, called the territorial control plan, which has never been publicly released.“The territorial control plan remains one of the best-kept secrets of the government of President Bukele,” said Astrid Valencia, a Central America researcher at Amnesty International. “This shows the authorities’ rejection of transparency.”ImageSoldiers at a checkpoint in Santa Tecla on Monday, part of a crackdown by the Salvadoran government after a surge of killings.Credit...Rodrigo Sura/EPA, via ShutterstockMs. Valencia added that the tool authorities seemed to be relying on — mass detentions — had been employed by previous governments with little results.“We need a comprehensive strategy,” she said.The gang violence the country suffers in many ways originated on the streets of Los Angeles. During the country’s civil war, thousands of Salvadorans migrated to the city, settling in poor and marginalized communities already riddled with gang violence. Many of those migrants joined existing gangs or started their own for protection.After the war ended in 1992, thousands of Salvadoran immigrants arrested for gang violence in the United States were deported, and they returned to their home country to find it in shambles. The scars of El Salvador’s war had cut through the fabric of society, leaving a decrepit state with few services — perfect conditions for the recent deportees to establish branches of their Los Angeles gangs in Central America.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNow, MS-13 has evolved into a transnational criminal organization with a hand in everything from garbage collection to illegal drugs in various countries.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/28/multimedia/28ELSALVADOR-arrest/28ELSALVADOR-arrest-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

Some protested at the gates of housing complexes that were locked with little notice. Others, sent to government isolation facilities, were forced to sleep on the floor because of a shortage of beds.For still others, the city’s Covid-19 restrictions have had life-threatening implications. Some residents have been confined at home, unable to get kidney dialysis or other urgent treatment. A nurse who suffered an asthma attack died after she was denied care by a hospital that cited Covid prevention protocols.Officials had tried to limit disruptions by confining buildings or neighborhoods, arguing that a full-scale lockdown in the city of 26 million was untenable.

The city declared a staggered lockdown that closed nonessential businesses, halted public transportation and confined the majority of the population to their homes.The measures split the city in half, first closing the eastern section for a five-day quarantine starting Monday, before turning to a similar shutdown in the western portion. Shanghai’s caseload of 3,500 on Monday was tiny compared with much of the world, but it has been driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Officials said the lockdown would enable the authorities to conduct mass testing.ImageLining up for eggs  in Shanghai on Monday.

The government’s fear is that an uncontrolled spread could overwhelm hospitals and cause a catastrophic loss of life. Large numbers of Chinese adults 80 and older are unvaccinated, and there is little immunity from earlier infections. Hong Kong’s struggle to contain a Covid outbreak has offered a glimpse of what that might look like: Deaths there spiked in recent weeks, particularly among unvaccinated older adults.“The challenge is that lockdowns and nucleic testing demand manpower and medical resources in addition to their impact on the economy and life in general,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The leadership is trying hard to continue the current practices but are also assessing. But Omicron may very well force the hand of the leadership” to abandon its unsustainable reliance on lockdowns, he said. The government has been working on administering vaccine boosters for the elderly and buying anti-viral drugs to prepare for such a scenario, he said.The central government is still pushing officials across the country to stamp out the virus, deploying measures that are among the world’s strictest, including isolating anyone who tests positive and enforcing quarantines on people deemed at risk of infection. White-collar employees, shoppers and diners have been forced to isolate inside offices, stores and restaurants if they were deemed to be close contacts. People who test positive are sent either to hospitals or to government isolation facilities set up in schools, exhibition centers and other spaces.In Shanghai, though, signs abound that the policy, and the populace, are stretched thin.Ivy Sun, a 32-year-old counselor, had been looking forward to freedom after being held in her home under a five-day lockdown on her neighborhood. On Sunday, after the announcement of the citywide closure, she was suddenly allowed a breath of fresh air, but just for seven hours. She and her neighbors rushed out to get groceries and other supplies for yet another confinement.“It felt like an apocalyptic scene. Everyone ran out. A lot of people were on the streets near the neighborhood, and all the stores were filled with people,” Ms. Sun said.Image Shanghai has announced a staggered lockdown to conduct mass testing.

A duty officer who answered the phone at the Xuhui district police station denied that there had been a protest.While the authorities have been quick to enforce isolation and home quarantine on residents, they have lagged in ensuring that all those in confinement can get help for serious medical conditions.

But the notification that it had issued a first set of fines, known as fixed penalty notices, was confirmation that it had found that the social gatherings at the prime minister’s office had violated the law.The police had issued a questionnaire to Mr. Johnson, who was present at several of the gatherings under scrutiny. But the prime minister, who has steadfastly denied he violated any rules, was not among those told that they had been fined in the initial round of notices, according to Downing Street.“We will today initially begin to refer 20 fixed penalty notices to be issued for breaches of Covid-19 regulations,” the police force said in a statement, noting that it may impose additional fines. “We are making every effort to progress this investigation at speed and have completed a number of assessments,” it added.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIt was not clear how many people had been cited — it is possible that some people will have received more than one notice — and the police did not say how much the accused would have to pay.After facing the looming threat of a no-confidence vote, Mr. Johnson’s political fortunes have rebounded markedly in the past six weeks, largely because the war in Ukraine has eclipsed the outcry over the parties.

The draft — which was shared by opponents of the deal and verified as legitimate by the Australian government — spurred alarm in a region where concerns about China’s influence has been growing for years.The draft suggests that Chinese warships could flow into the nation or Chinese troops could intervene domestically on the island in times of crisis — putting them on Australia’s and New Zealand’s doorstep.The leaked document stated that “Solomon Islands may, according to its own needs, request China to send police, armed police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces to Solomon Islands to assist in maintaining social order, protecting people’s lives and property.” It required secrecy, noting, “Neither party shall disclose the cooperation information to a third party.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn his speech, Mr. Sogavare blasted those who had leaked the draft deal as “lunatics” and “agents of foreign interference.” He said that the pursuit of “liberal hegemony” had failed and criticized foreign powers for assuming that the Solomon Islands could not act in its own best interests.Mr. Sogavare declined to provide more details about the contents of the deal, which he said had been finalized, but added that he had not been pressured by Beijing and had “no intention to ask China to build a military base in Solomon Islands.”He insisted that it was “utter nonsense” to say that China posed a security threat in the Pacific. “We find it very insulting,” he said, “to be branded as unfit to manage our sovereign affairs or have other motives in pursing our national interests.”He said that the needs of the Solomon Islands were beyond what could be provided by one partner nation.

Not least a terrible feeling of dread.Nearly 30 years ago I was in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, a territory in southern Russia that dared declare independence from Moscow as the Soviet Union was breaking apart. The Chechens paid heavily for their presumption. The Russian army twice invaded and twice flattened the city in what has become a familiar Russian playbook for imposing control over outlying regions of the former Russian empire and bludgeoning people into submission.Ukraine is very different from Chechnya, which was a small territory of just one million people in the North Caucasus. Ukraine is a sovereign nation with a population of more than 40 million, an armed force of over 200,000 troops, and a capital city of three million or more inhabitants.But Chechnya’s experience is worth recalling since it was the first time we saw Vladimir V. Putin develop his game plan to reassert Russian dominion wherever he wanted. His methods are brute force and terror: the bombing and besieging of cities, deliberate targeting of civilians, and the abduction and jailing of local leaders and journalists and their replacement by loyal quislings. The tactics are straight out of Stalin’s playbook, as former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright wrote shortly before her death.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe war in Chechnya began with a shocking display of Russian incompetence. On New Year’s Eve in 1994, Russian troops were sent blundering into Grozny. Largely composed of conscript soldiers who were ignorant of what to expect, the force drove long columns of tanks and armor into the city in what was intended to be a swift overthrow of the Chechen leadership.ImageRussian soldiers near Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, in December 1994.Credit...Ivan Shlamov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThey were met by highly motivated units of Chechen fighters, armed with anti-tank rockets, who ambushed their columns, trapping and burning hundreds of Russian soldiers and armor in one night. An entire brigade, the Maikop brigade, was wiped out almost to a man.There was a stunned silence in Russia in the days that followed as the leadership took stock of what had happened and the army sent in reinforcements. The Chechens celebrated their victory and let their prisoners telephone their mothers back home in Russia, calling on Moscow to withdraw its troops. But the lull did not last.The Russian army moved to flank Grozny on three sides and unleashed a terrifying onslaught of air and artillery strikes on the city. Their forces smashed the leafy suburbs, the industrial parks and then residential districts, block by block, moving in on the ground bit by bit as they forced the Chechen fighters to retreat under overwhelming bombardment. AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyI saw it close up from both sides, reporting from behind Russian lines as their big guns pounded the city, and running the gamut of bombs and shells to reach the bunkers where the civilian population lived under siege. A modern, European city became a ravaged moonscape. I remember how buildings were shorn in half, and the contents of people’s lives spilled out of their apartments into the open air.The Chechen fighters were ubiquitous, racing in civilian cars to the frontline, running through back streets and destroyed buildings. They became master urban guerrillas and held out for weeks against overwhelming odds. They had widespread support from the civilian population, which was angered by Moscow’s use of brute force. A Muslim people, the Chechens had suffered oppression and deportation under Stalin and had a long history of resistance to Russian rule.When the Russians found a particularly obstinate defense, they would drop lethal cluster bombs that cut through anyone or any vehicles on the streets, whether combatants or pensioners trying to collect water or fleeing civilians.After three months Russian forces took the city center and soldiers sat on plastic chairs guarding a wasteland of destroyed buildings, gouged earth and stricken tree stumps. The fight moved to the southern suburbs, where Russian forces destroyed the last resistance with bunker-busting bombs, which crashed through eight-story buildings right into basements full of civilians, and fuel-air bombs, which exploded above the rooftops and spread a powerful shock wave.ImageA wrecked tank and a trolley bus burning on a Grozny street during fighting in November 1994.Credit...Ivan Shlamov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThere was much in the experience that echoes in Ukraine today. Even though nearly 30 years have intervened, it is staggering to see Russia employ many of the same tactics — and mistakes — in Ukraine. Despite the hard lessons learned in Chechnya, and in Afghanistan before that, Russian troops drove down the main highways with their tanks and fuel trucks in an attempt to seize control of the Ukrainian capital in the first weeks of March.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyUkrainian troops were waiting and mounted repeated ambushes. They destroyed tanks and armored vehicles, creating such a pileup that they blocked the Russian advance. Scores of Russian soldiers were killed and taken prisoner. Survivors were forced to escape into the surrounding woods. Other tank columns were destroyed on the eastern approaches to Kyiv.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 11:43 a.m. ET45 minutes ago45 minutes agoThe war is reshaping how Europe’s governments spend.Russian forces arrest an occupied city’s education chief during a struggle over changing the curriculum.Even with signs of progress in peace talks, the fighting continued on several fronts.There followed something of a lull. The city breathed again. A few cafes even reopened.Now, in the second month of the war, Ukrainian officials say the Russians have turned their focus away from an assault on the capital for now. But Western analysts warn that Kyiv remains very much a target, and we are already witnessing horrific bombardment of other cities around the country.ImageChechen fighters in Grozny in January 1995.Credit...Alexander Nemenov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEven as many Russian forces have pulled back from Kyiv to regroup, others have already spread out and begun flanking the city. Among the miles-long Russian armored column that had advanced on the capital, military analysts identified multiple rockets launchers, heavy artillery and even fuel-air weapons. Heavy fighting is unrelenting in several northern suburbs and the city has come under almost nightly, and more recently daily, cruise missile and artillery strikes.Twice in the last two weeks the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has ordered a 36-hour-long curfew, ordering all civilians to stay indoors for two nights and a day as military commanders warned of mounting danger.“Please stay at home, it will be much more safe,” Mr. Klitschko pleaded last week at an open air news conference as air raid sirens sounded across the city. A former world heavyweight boxing champion, he tried to prepare his shocked people for an extended fight.“We cannot give an answer of how long will be this war,” he said. “We hope it is weeks. I hope not years.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyEven as Kyiv braces for the worst, Russian forces have been pounding Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv; the port city of Mariupol; the southern city of Mykolaiv; and the northern town of Chernihiv. Thwarted from seizing them in the first days of the war, the Russian military has pounded them from afar, steadily demolishing infrastructure and buildings, including hospitals, bomb shelters and schools, even while thousands of civilians are trapped inside.ImageGrozny residents in March 1995.Credit...Alexander Nemenov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“They are an artillery army really,” Samuel Cranny-Evans, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a British research body, said of the Russian military. “Artillery is the first response to most problems whether they are fighting in a field, mountains or a city. The result of this, in the latter case, is a flattened city and civilian casualties.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. Russia said that it would sharply “reduce military activity” near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. The announcement was the first sign of progress to emerge from peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.Biden’s comments. During a speech in Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said that President Vladimir V. Putin “cannot remain in power,” sending U.S. officials scrambling to walk back the ad-lib. On Monday, Mr. Biden stood by his remark, but said it was a personal expression of his “moral outrage.”A Chechen commander, Muslim Cheberloevsky, who fought against the Russian army in his homeland for more than a decade, knows the Russian methods only too well. He came with some of his fighters to support Ukraine when Mr. Putin moved to annex Crimea in 2014. He is now commanding a battalion of Chechen volunteers near Kyiv.He described the fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv as a game of cat-and-mouse: Russian forces inch half a dozen armored vehicles into a village, and his fighters, alongside the Ukrainians, try to hit them before they dig in. The Russians were trying to advance, “but their wheels are spinning,” he said.He was derisive about the Russian armed forces. “They have stupid tactics from the time of the Russian empire, they have not changed,” he said. “Their most important tactic is throwing bodies into the battle. They do not care about their own soldiers.”ImageA Chechen veteran and commander of the Sheikh Mansur battalion, Muslim Cheberloevsky, this month in Kyiv, Ukraine.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesThere is a whole next stage to the Putin playbook, which is well known to the Chechens. As Russian troops gained control on the ground in Chechnya, they crushed any further dissent with arrests and filtration camps and by turning and empowering local protégés and collaborators.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAfter unleashing horrendous firepower, the decisive blow exerted against Chechnya was the use of loyalist Chechens to impose control. Six years into the war, Mr. Putin turned the chief mufti of Chechnya to betray the rebel cause. The mufti’s son, Ramzan Kadyrov, became Mr. Putin’s chief henchman and has supplied Chechen fighters to support Russian forces in the wars in Syria and now Ukraine.There are already signs of such methods in Ukraine: the arrest and disappearance of local officials, detentions and threats against local journalists and the reported mass evacuation of civilians to Russia.The methods applied by Russian proxies over the last eight years in the separatist districts of eastern Ukraine — their rigid suppression and notorious prison — are as good an indication as any of the way the country could be run under Russian occupation.A Canadian diplomat and politician, Chris Alexander, who served in Canada’s embassy in Moscow at the height of the Chechen war, warned too of worse to come.“The only danger to Ukrainians at this point are Aleppo/Grozniy-style massed indirect fires,” he wrote to me. “This is not over — far from it.”ImageGrozny in 1995.Credit...Pascal Guyot/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/28/world/28Grozny-top/28Grozny-top-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"
