Push for a More Combative Stance on ChinaIt’s time for Americans to buckle down for a long struggle with Beijing, the Florida senator will argue in a speech.By Blake Hounshell and Leah Askarinam","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/marco-rubio-china-republicans.html","Marco Rubio Leads G.O.P. Push for a More Combative Stance on China","Published March 28, 2022","Blake Hounshell","Marco Rubio wants Americans to “wake up.”China is already locked in conflict with the United States, the Republican senator from Florida warns. We just haven’t realized it yet.And even as Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine shows that wars of aggression are no relic of the past — the “return of history,” Rubio calls it — he worries that China’s Communist rulers pose a more insidious, long-term danger to America’s peace and prosperity, and that the threat isn’t being treated with the seriousness it deserves.“It does us no good to pretend they’re not an adversary,” Rubio said in an interview. “Their goal is to rise at the expense of the United States.”As the top Republican on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, Rubio has access to the latest insights from U.S. spy agencies. And what he has seen of China’s growing reach has alarmed him: a campaign of economic espionage and infiltration of American institutions; a rapid buildup of nuclear and conventional forces that menace Taiwan; an expanding disinformation machine that seeks to undermine the U.S. all over the world.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThose concerns are widely shared by Democrats in Washington. Since taking office, the Biden administration has taken steps to bolster America’s alliances in Asia, reoriented NATO toward confronting China, approved nearly $1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, hit Chinese officials with sanctions, and sharply criticized China’s human rights policies and trade practices. Congress is busy finalizing the COMPETES Act, a mammoth piece of legislation both parties have framed as vital to countering China. But if Republicans take control of Congress in November, they will be in position to push for an even harder line.On Tuesday, Rubio will give a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, in which he plans to argue that “Beijing’s military might, ideological challenge to democracy, technological ambitions and influence over the global market pose an even more serious and systematic threat than the Soviet Union ever did.”Winning that conflict blinded Americans to the dark reality of totalitarianism, in Rubio’s telling. “Over the past three decades, we forgot that human nature tends toward a lust for domination,” read portions of his remarks that were shared with The New York Times. “The desire of the powerful to conquer, enslave and control those weaker than themselves.”What America needs above all else, Rubio argues, is “unity and clarity about the threat we face.”The speech is a forceful entry into the debate in Washington and among Republicans over how to deal with Beijing. How much emphasis should U.S. leaders place on Russia versus China? Is China an adversary to be combated or merely a fierce competitor? Is the United States losing its edge? And, if so, what is to be done about it?Rubio’s own Twitter feed embodies the competing demands on policymakers’ attention. Even as he hones his arguments on China, he’s been live-tweeting his insights on the war in Ukraine.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Republicans are wrestling with whether and how to prioritize these threats,” said Elbridge Colby, who was a senior defense official in the Trump administration. “But the truth is that we’re not just going to rewind the clock to 1989 and everything’s going to be like the old days.”A drive to out-hawk the hawksRepublicans may be divided on Russia — between mainstream national security hawks and a smaller faction that admires Putin’s perceived toughness and his defense of traditional values — but criticizing China is a surefire political winner on the right.In a poll conducted last year, nearly half of Americans said they viewed China as the greatest enemy of the United States, a number double what it was 2020. In a survey last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 64 percent of Republicans said the United States should try to limit China’s rise, whereas 60 percent of Democrats said they preferred cooperation and engagement.“Republicans are very negative toward China, more so than Democrats,” said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. He noted that the coronavirus pandemic had fueled growing skepticism of China and its role in the world.China is already proving to be a potent campaign issue in the 2022 midterms, as Republican politicians try to out-hawk one another in primaries for congressional seats. In Midwestern states hobbled by the loss of manufacturing jobs, it’s a domestic policy topic as much as it is a national security concern.In Ohio, Mike Gibbons, a businessman who is leading the Senate Republican primary in some polls, is fending off allegations that he once favored outsourcing jobs to China.In Pennsylvania’s Senate race, David McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, and Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor, are trading accusations over who is more tainted by Beijing.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFor Rubio, his first task is to get re-elected in Florida this year. But he has run for president once before, and allies expect he may do so again. So his bid to lay down a marker on China is bound to raise questions about his ambitions for 2024.ImageIn an upcoming speech, Rubio plans to argue that China poses “an even more serious and systematic threat than the Soviet Union ever did.”Credit...Sarahbeth Maney/The New York TimesA rival the U.S. is highly dependent onIf China’s a more serious geopolitical threat than the Soviet Union, it’s also a more complex one.Americans traded more than $600 billion worth of goods and services with China in 2020 alone, dwarfing the amount the United States ever exchanged with the Soviets. The U.S. also depends on China for raw materials like rare earth minerals, used in everything from mobile phones to semiconductors to car batteries. And Beijing’s cooperation is essential to making progress on climate change, Biden administration officials emphasize.In the event of a war over Taiwan, Rubio said, “It won’t be as easy to sanction China as it was to sanction Putin.” Not only can China wield far greater military and financial muscle than Russia, but American elites are also more deeply compromised by their ties to Beijing, he argued.“China’s been very effective at deputizing the American corporate sector as their lobbyists,” Rubio said. It’s something he says he experienced firsthand when he pushed for sanctions over China’s treatment of its Muslim minority.The administration has resisted labeling China as an outright enemy, even as it steps up its criticism of the Chinese government. During his speech last year to the U.N. General Assembly, President Biden said, “We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs.”But the White House’s actions suggest otherwise. The budget it released today mentions China 12 times, referring to the country as a “pacing challenge.” It calls for a Pentagon budget of $773 billion — a record that eclipses the Trump administration’s spending on the military.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImageWhat to read tonightA federal judge ruled that former President Donald Trump most likely committed felonies, Luke Broadwater and Alan Feuer report, including obstructing the work of Congress and conspiring to defraud the United States.The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol is looking to interview Virginia Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, Broadwater reports.

They aren’t meant to be enacted as written. It’s Congress’s job to decide how much money to spend and on what. So it’s worth reading Biden’s newly unveiled $5.8 trillion budget for 2023 for what message the president is trying to send — and what values he’s hoping to convey.With Biden facing some of the lowest job approval numbers of his presidency, this looks a lot like a shuffle to the center ahead of the midterms, as Jonathan Weisman assesses. So how is Biden trying to present himself?Tough on deficits. Although it’s debatable whether voters care about deficits, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia certainly does.

The budget contains billions in requests for federal law enforcement, including $17.4 billion to combat violent crime and more than $30 billion in grants to state and local police departments. There’s also a 5 percent increase for various Homeland Security initiatives. As Katie Benner notes, the message here is pretty simple: Biden does not want to defund the police.Tough on defense. All told, Biden is asking for $813.3 billion in national security spending, a 4 percent bump from 2022. Much of the new money would go to counter threats from China, Iran and Russia. As Michael Shear notes, it’s a far cry from the peace dividend progressives expected from the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.Tough on the wealthy. Biden is proposing a minimum tax on American households worth more than $100 million, an idea in line with what progressives like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have championed.

"1648571339-1182","https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics","Biden Administration Will Start Vaccinating Migrants at BorderSome migrants who refuse will be detained and placed in removal proceedings, according to directions given to homeland security officials.By Eileen Sullivan","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/vaccines-migrants-border.html","Biden Administration Will Start Vaccinating Migrants at Border","null","Eileen Sullivan","WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is requiring coronavirus vaccines for some undocumented migrants at the southwest border, a policy change that comes days before the administration’s next review of a public health order that has limited immigration during the pandemic.Under the plan, officials will start vaccinating undocumented migrants without proof of vaccination who are apprehended by border officials, but not expelled under the public health order, in seven areas including San Diego, El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley. A description of the plan was shared with The New York Times.According to directions given to senior homeland security officials on Sunday, if single adults refuse to be vaccinated, they will be detained and put into deportation proceedings. If they request asylum and cannot remain in detention, they will be released with a monitoring device “with stringent conditions.” If migrant families refuse vaccination, they will also be given monitoring devices with the same conditions.The White House has said little about whether it will soon lift the public health order, which the Trump administration put in place at the start of the pandemic. The order, known as Title 42, gives border officials the authority to turn back migrants seeking to enter the United States so that they do not spread the coronavirus here, a precaution that public health experts have called unnecessary.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is supposed to review whether the rule is still necessary at this stage in the pandemic, and issue a decision in the coming days.The administration’s decision to start vaccinating some undocumented migrants appears to be an acknowledgment that there are measures other than the public health order that can be taken to minimize the spread of the coronavirus across borders. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said vaccinating immigrants in the department’s custody is a “public health best practice.” The spokesman did not explain why the department had waited so long to put that practice in place with regard to undocumented migrants, many of whom come from Central America. Planning for these vaccinations has been in the works. In November, the administration put out a request for a short-term contract to provide Covid-19 vaccinations at points along the southwest border.Previously, the administration has resisted vaccinating undocumented immigrants, despite multiple proposals from the Department of Homeland Security over the past year on how to do it. President Biden’s domestic policy adviser, Susan Rice, has privately raised concerns that it would provide an incentive for more undocumented migrants to try to cross the border, according to three current and former government officials with knowledge of the ongoing discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Noah Gottschalk, the global policy lead at Oxfam America, said that argument makes little sense.“Based on our work in the regions and places that people are coming from, that would have absolutely nothing to do with people coming,” he said. “People have access to vaccines. They are coming because they’re fleeing persecution.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyInside the Homeland Security Department, officials have been planning for Title 42 to end in early April. They expect large crowds of migrants as a result, exceeding the already-high numbers that have been crossing without documentation in recent weeks.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 9:15 a.m. ET3 hours ago3 hours agoHow Shanghai’s lockdown is testing China’s ‘Covid-zero’ policy, and people’s limits.Experts warn of racial disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of long Covid.The Biden administration will start vaccinating migrants at the border.Since President Biden has been in office, there has been a significant spike in the number of migrants crossing the southwest border, many fleeing poverty and persecution. The administration has used the public health rule to expel migrants a little more than half of the time, allowing in others with humanitarian exemptions.Migrant children who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian have been exempted from the rule and allowed to enter. The administration has been offering vaccinations to eligible migrant children in government shelters for months; Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also been offering vaccinations to immigrants in detention. And the administration has been vaccinating asylum-seeking migrants who are waiting in Mexico until the United States makes a decision on their case.Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said vaccinations should have been offered to all undocumented migrants apprehended on American soil.“There’s no actually valid argument to not vaccinate people at the border, especially when our vaccination rates are the lowest that they’ve been in the United States and we’re actually throwing vaccine in the trash,” Dr. Adalja said. “If they don’t do this, they would rather put vaccine in the trash can than put it into a migrant’s arm, is basically what that amounts to.”Critics of the order say it is being used to control the influx of undocumented migrants. The Biden administration, which has relied heavily on scientific evidence to justify many other health precautions during the pandemic, has not produced data that shows undocumented migrants play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus.In a ruling regarding the use of the policy, a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted the lack of data.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We are not cavalier about the risks of Covid-19. And we would be sensitive to declarations in the record by C.D.C. officials testifying to the efficacy” of the public health order, the panel wrote earlier this month. “But there are none.”They added: “From a public-health perspective, based on the limited record before us, it’s far from clear that the C.D.C.’s order serves any purpose.”The White House and Homeland Security Department have consistently said the public health order is issued at the sole discretion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“It is not a matter of immigration policy,” Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Homeland Security secretary, said on March 17. The C.D.C. determines the order’s necessity, he said, “on a public health basis, depending on where we are in the arc of the Covid-19 pandemic.”Mr. Mayorkas pointed to the spread of variants in other countries. While Covid case numbers are falling in most of the United States, an Omicron subvariant, BA.2, is fueling an increase in cases in Europe and could cause another surge here, although it does not appear to be causing widespread severe illness.The administration has been fighting in court to keep the public health order in place for migrant families, even though many are already exempted from it. The same appeals panel that noted earlier this month that the C.D.C. had not presented any evidence justifying the order also ruled that the administration could not use it to expel families to countries where they would face persecution or torture.Lawyers were supposed to file a status update last week, but instead asked for an extension until after the C.D.C. decides whether to keep the rule in place.Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.","null"

Ross, No. 21-468.Lawyers for the Humane Society of the United States and other animal welfare groups, which intervened in the case to defend the law, wrote that it was meant to end “cruel and unsanitary conditions that threaten the health of California consumers” and that “producers can freely sell products outside California from farm animals confined contrary to Proposition 12’s standards.”A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, rejected the argument that the law’s out-of-state effects made it invalid. “State laws that regulate only conduct in the state, including the sale of products in the state, do not have impermissible extraterritorial effects,” Judge Sandra S. Ikuta wrote for the panel.The law forbids the sale of most pork in California unless the pig it comes from was born to a sow that was housed with 24 square feet of space. But most sows around the nation are kept in much smaller enclosures.“These pens,” the groups challenging the California law wrote, “provide around 14 square feet of space and — for hygiene, safety, and animal-welfare and husbandry reasons — do not allow the sow to turn around.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe size of California’s market, the groups added, makes it impossible to ignore the state’s requirements. “Californians account for 13 percent of the nation’s pork consumption, but raise hardly any pigs,” their brief said. “The massive costs of complying with Proposition 12 fall almost exclusively on out-of-state farmers.”Since California imports almost all the pork sold in the state, they said, the law as a practical matter seeks to regulate producers in places like Minnesota and Iowa.","null"

Trump and a lawyer who had advised him on how to overturn the 2020 election most likely had committed felonies, including obstructing the work of Congress and conspiring to defraud the United States.The judge’s comments in the civil case of the lawyer, John Eastman, marked a significant breakthrough for the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The committee, which is weighing making a criminal referral to the Justice Department, had used a filing in the case to lay out the crimes it believed Mr. Trump might have committed.Mr. Trump has not been charged with any crime, and the judge’s ruling had no immediate, practical legal effect on him. But it essentially ratified the committee’s argument that Mr. Trump’s efforts to block Congress from certifying Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Electoral College victory could well rise to the level of a criminal conspiracy.“The illegality of the plan was obvious,” wrote Judge David O. Carter of the Central District of California. “Our nation was founded on the peaceful transition of power, epitomized by George Washington laying down his sword to make way for democratic elections. Ignoring this history, President Trump vigorously campaigned for the vice president to single-handedly determine the results of the 2020 election.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe actions taken by Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman, Judge Carter found, amounted to “a coup in search of a legal theory.”The Justice Department has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation of the Capitol assault but has given no public indication that it is considering a criminal case against Mr. Trump. A criminal referral from the House committee could increase pressure on Attorney General Merrick B. Garland to do so.The judge’s ruling came as the committee was barreling ahead with its investigation. This week alone, people familiar with the investigation said, the panel has lined up testimony from four top Trump White House officials, including Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law and adviser, whose interview was scheduled for Thursday.The committee also voted 9 to 0 on Monday night to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against two other allies of Mr. Trump — Peter Navarro, a former White House adviser, and Dan Scavino Jr., a former deputy chief of staff — for their participation in efforts to overturn the 2020 election and their subsequent refusal to comply with the panel’s subpoenas. The matter now moves to the Rules Committee, then the full House. If it passes there, the Justice Department will decide whether to charge the men. A contempt of Congress charge carries a penalty of up to a year in jail.But Judge Carter’s decision was perhaps the investigation’s biggest development to date, suggesting its investigators have built a case strong enough to convince a federal judge of Mr. Trump’s culpability and laying out a road map for a potential criminal referral.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyJudge Carter’s decision came in an order for Mr. Eastman, a conservative lawyer who had written a memo that members of both parties have likened to a blueprint for a coup, to turn over more than 100 emails to the committee.A lawyer for Mr. Eastman said in a statement on Monday that he “respectfully disagrees” with Judge Carter’s findings but would comply with the order to turn over documents.In a statement hailing the judge’s decision, the chairman of the House committee, Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, and its vice chair, Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, said the nation must not allow what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, “to be minimized and cannot accept as normal these threats to our democracy.” Mr. Trump made no public statement about the ruling.Many of the documents the committee will now receive relate to a legal strategy proposed by Mr. Eastman to pressure Vice President Mike Pence not to certify electors from several key swing states when Congress convened on Jan. 6, 2021. “The true animating force behind these emails was advancing a political strategy: to persuade Vice President Pence to take unilateral action on Jan. 6,” Judge Carter wrote.One of the documents, according to the ruling, is an email containing the draft of a memo written for another one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, recommending that Mr. Pence “reject electors from contested states.”“This may have been the first time members of President Trump’s team transformed a legal interpretation of the Electoral Count Act into a day-by-day plan of action,” Judge Carter wrote.Mr. Eastman had filed suit against the panel, trying to persuade a judge to block the committee’s subpoena for documents in his possession. As part of the suit, Mr. Eastman sought to shield from release documents he said were covered by attorney-client privilege.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn response, the committee argued — under the legal theory known as the crime-fraud exception — that the privilege did not cover information conveyed from a client to a lawyer if it was part of furthering or concealing a crime.The panel said its investigators had accumulated evidence demonstrating that Mr. Trump, Mr. Eastman and other allies could be charged with criminal violations including obstructing an official proceeding of Congress and conspiracy to defraud the American people.Judge Carter, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, agreed, writing that he believed it was “likely” that the men not only had conspired to defraud the United States but “dishonestly conspired to obstruct the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.”“Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history,” he wrote.In deciding that Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had “more likely than not” broken the law — the legal standard for determining whether Mr. Eastman could claim attorney-client privilege — Judge Carter noted that the former president had facilitated two meetings in the days before Jan. 6 that were “explicitly tied to persuading Vice President Pence to disrupt the joint session of Congress.”Capitol Riot’s Aftermath: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4Trump’s tweet. Weeks before the Jan 6 attack, President Donald J. Trump sent a tweet that ended “Be there, will be wild!” Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators have gathered growing evidence of how this tweet was a crucial call to action for militants in the riot.Judge says Trump likely committed crimes. In a court filing in a civil case, the Jan. 6 House committee laid out the crimes it believed Mr. Trump might have committed. The federal judge assigned to the case ruled that Mr. Trump most likely committed felonies in trying to overturn the 2020 election.Virginia Thomas’s text messages. In the weeks before the Capitol riot, Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, sent several texts imploring Mark Meadows, President Trump’s chief of staff, to take steps to overturn the election. The Jan. 6 House committee is likely to seek an interview with Ms. Thomas, said those familiar with the matter.Contempt charges. The Jan. 6 House committee voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro, a former White House adviser, and Dan Scavino Jr., a former deputy chief of staff, for refusing to comply with its subpoenas.At the first meeting, on Jan. 4, Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman invited Mr. Pence and two of his top aides, Greg Jacob and Marc Short, to the Oval Office. There, Judge Carter wrote, Mr. Eastman “presented his plan to Vice President Pence, focusing on either rejecting electors or delaying the count.”That meeting was followed by another, Judge Carter wrote, on Jan. 5, during which Mr. Eastman sought again to persuade Mr. Jacob to go along with the scheme.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Trump continued to pressure Mr. Pence even on Jan. 6, Judge Carter wrote, noting that the former president had made several last-minute appeals to Mr. Pence  on Twitter. Mr. Trump called Mr. Pence by phone, Judge Carter wrote, and “once again urged him ‘to make the call’ and enact the plan.”While the House committee has no authority to directly bring charges against Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump was not a party to the Eastman civil case, Judge Carter’s ruling on Monday underscored the persistent questions of whether Mr. Trump could face criminal culpability for both his business dealings and his efforts to reverse the outcome of the election.Last week, The New York Times reported that a prosecutor in New York City who was investigating Mr. Trump’s financial dealings believed the former president was guilty of “numerous felonies” in how he handled his real-estate and business transaction before taking office. The assessment of Mr. Trump by the prosecutor, Mark F. Pomerantz, came in a letter last month in which Mr. Pomerantz announced he was resigning from the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which had stopped pursuing an indictment of Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump is also facing investigation from the district attorney in Atlanta who recently convened a special grand jury to help probe the former president’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.That inquiry centers on Mr. Trump’s actions in the two months between his election loss and Congress’s certification of the results, including a call he made to Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to pressure him to “find 11,780 votes” — the margin by which Mr. Trump lost the state.The House committee has been seeking to assemble a definitive account of Mr. Trump’s efforts to hold on to the White House and how they led to the assault on the Capitol. Among the documents the committee will now receive from Mr. Eastman is an email that sketched “a series of events for the days leading up to and following Jan. 6, if Vice President Pence were to delay counting or reject electoral votes,” Judge Carter wrote.The email “maps out potential Supreme Court suits and the impact of different judicial outcomes” were Mr. Pence to enact the plan.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe committee will also get documents related to state legislators who were involved in the effort to persuade Mr. Pence not to certify some electoral votes. One of them, Judge Carter wrote, is a letter from the Republican members of the Arizona legislature to Mr. Pence. Two others are letters from a Georgia state senator to Mr. Trump.The committee has already heard from more than 750 witnesses. John McEntee, the former president’s personnel chief, testified Monday; Anthony Ornato, the former White House chief of operations, was scheduled to testify Tuesday; and Matthew Pottinger, former deputy national security adviser, will do so at a later date, those familiar with the investigation said.Both Mr. Navarro and Mr. Scavino have argued they are prevented from testifying by Mr. Trump’s assertions of executive privilege, and that President Biden — who waived executive privilege for both men — does not have the authority to waive executive privilege over the testimony of a former president’s senior aide.","null"

Election BillAs Republicans rush to pass a second round of new voting and election rules, a bipartisan group of election officials is fighting back.By Maya King and Nick Corasaniti","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/georgia-election-bill.html","Local Election Officials in Georgia Oppose G.O.P. Election Bill","Published March 28, 2022","Maya King","ATLANTA — A year ago, when Georgia Republicans passed a mammoth law of election measures and voting restrictions, many local election officials felt frustrated and sidelined, as their concerns about resources, ballot access and implementation went largely ignored.This year, Republicans have returned with a new bill — and the election officials are pushing back.A bipartisan coalition of county-level election administrators — the people who carry out the day-to-day work of running elections — is speaking out against the latest Republican measure. At a legislative hearing on Monday, they warned that the proposal would create additional burdens on a dwindling force of election workers and that the provisions could lead to more voter intimidation.“You’re going to waste time, and you’re going to cause me to lose poll workers,” said Joel Natt, a Republican member of the Forsyth County board of elections, referring to a provision in the bill that he said would force workers to count hundreds of blank sheets of paper. “I have 400 poll workers that work for our board. That is 400 people that I could see telling me after May, ‘Have a nice life,’ and it’s hard enough to keep them right now.”Among other provisions, the bill would expand the reach of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation over election crimes; limit private funding of elections; empower partisan poll watchers; and establish new requirements for tracking absentee ballots as they are verified and counted.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe bill passed the Georgia House this month, roughly two weeks after it was first introduced. Initially, the State Senate appeared set to pass the measure at a similar speed. The state’s legislative session ends on April 4, giving lawmakers less than a week to pass the bill.But county-level election officials worked behind the scenes, in letters and phone calls to legislators, expressing their concerns about the bill and dissatisfaction that they had not been consulted in the drafting process.The pushback comes as the impact of the wave of election laws passed by Republicans last year is beginning to be felt. In Texas, where a new law altered the absentee ballot process, election officials dealt with widespread confusion among absentee voters in the March primary. Mail ballot rejections surged, and county officials worked around the clock to help voters fix their ballots. Still, more than 18,000 voters had their ballots tossed out.A Guide to the 2022 Midterm ElectionsMidterms Begin: The Texas primaries officially opened the 2022 election season.

But many local officials simply felt ignored by lawmakers who were eager to appear to be addressing Republican voters’ false beliefs about fraud in the 2020 election.The statewide association of local election officials is now working to “start taking stances on legislation like this, where the association would have a view that represents a majority of our members,” said Joseph Kirk, the elections supervisor for Bartow County, which is deeply Republican, who serves as a secretary for the association. He added that the group had not taken a stance on the election bill but that many members were voicing their opinions individually.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAt a conference this month, Ryan Germany, general counsel for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, encouraged members to speak up.“They really need to know what you guys think about this stuff because they hear from a lot of people, but I don’t think they hear from a lot of election officials,” said Mr. Germany, who spoke favorably about several provisions in the bill, according to audio of the event obtained by The New York Times.Dozens of voting rights advocates and county election officials crowded the State Senate Ethics Committee hearing on Monday afternoon, saying the bill would make it harder for election administrators to do their jobs.ImageFrom left, State Senators Sally Harrell, Butch Miller and Jeff Mullis listened as Cindy Battles, right, testified during the hearing on Monday. Credit...Nicole Craine for The New York Times“There are so many unfunded mandates being passed by this body. You are not giving county election officials the budget that they need to run their elections,” said Cindy Battles, the policy and engagement director at the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda, a civil rights group. “And then you are making it more difficult to get what they need.”Several officials pointed to a provision that would require elections administrators to account for all elections-related documents, including the pieces of paper that ballots are printed on. Mr. Natt, the vice chair of elections for Forsyth County’s board of elections, held up a ream of paper to represent one of the hundreds of blank sheets of paper that his office would need to count under the law.“That is a lot of counting. That is a lot of time and waste management,” he said.State Representative James Burchett, a Republican from southeastern Georgia and sponsor of the bill, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution this month that “the intent of the bill is to address issues that we’ve seen in the elections process.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDuring the hearing on Monday, State Senator Butch Miller, a Republican and member of the State Senate Ethics Committee, appeared to consider some of the officials’ concerns.“I think we’ll probably have additional work to be done,” he said. While Mr. Miller said he was not interested in sweeping changes to the bill, he also said he was not opposed to “tweaking them and accommodating certain issues.” The committee has not yet scheduled a vote on the bill.Election officials warned about language they considered too broad in a provision that restricts third-party donations to election offices. The proposal is popular among Republicans who believe grants from an organization tied to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, had undue influence in the 2020 election. Some Georgia election officials said the legislation would require any organization that makes a donation to receive approval from the state board of elections. That could include churches or other local groups that offer their buildings as polling locations.“By a strict interpretation of this particular provision, that would be a grant of gift or donation,” Milton Kidd, the elections director in Douglas County, a deeply Democratic county, said in an interview.Mr. Kidd added that many churches did not have staff to handle the application process, which could threaten his ability to maintain enough polling locations.Officials also took issue with a provision requiring partisan poll watchers to be given “meaningful access” to observe the ballot-counting process. The language might jeopardize the privacy of the ballot, they said.“I am a big fan of poll watchers, of being observed, I want my polling places to have observation, it’s a very important part of the process,” said Mr. Kirk, the administrator in Bartow County, which is northwest of Atlanta. “But it’s also very important to have guardrails on that observation, to keep it from becoming disruptive, to make sure a person’s information stays safe.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA provision that gives the Georgia Bureau of Investigation the power to subpoena election records for fraud investigations has also stirred opposition, mostly among Democratic local officials, who view it as both unnecessary — the secretary of state’s office currently handles election investigations — and intended to scare off voters.“That just smacks of voter intimidation,” said Dele Lowman Smith, the chair of the DeKalb County board of voter registration and elections. “And that’s a big concern.”","null"

To universal prekindergarten and combating climate change he actually added a new tax on the wealth of billionaires.But its framing was a marked shift from the 2021 pitch for a fundamental transformation of an ailing American society. Instead, Mr. Biden’s plan was an appeal based on the reality of the moment, to both new dangers around the globe and at home, where inflation and crime are crushing the president’s political standing.Endangered Democrats in swing districts have been urging Mr. Biden to counter the messages from the far left and address the kitchen-table issues facing voters with incremental steps, not transformative legislation. For them, the budget promises deficit reduction to cool the economy and tangible steps to unclog supply-chain bottlenecks that contribute to rising prices.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe heft of his message this year comes not from an urgent appeal to address racial and income inequality, climate change and the struggles of the middle class, but to reassert American dominance in a dangerous and competitive world.“We are at the beginning of a decisive decade that will determine the future of strategic competition with China, the trajectory of the climate crisis and whether the rules governing technology, trade and international economics enshrine or violate our democratic values,” the budget states, justifying large increases to project U.S. military and diplomatic strength globally.Under the new plan, the left wing’s hopes for a peace dividend at the end of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would be scotched in favor of a new great powers military budget that would bring the Defense Department’s allocation to $773 billion, an increase of nearly 10 percent over the level for the 2021 fiscal year. Rather than cuts, Mr. Biden pledges to bolster the nation’s nuclear weapons program, including all three legs of the nuclear “triad”: bombers, land-based intercontinental missiles and submarines.Domestically, the big-ticket items from last year are still there: universal prekindergarten, generous subsidies for child care and commitments to clean, renewable energy. Representative Ro Khanna of California, a prominent progressive, praised the proposed 20 percent minimum tax on billionaires that would, for the first time, tax unrealized gains on assets if income taxes fell short of the minimum.“As a representative of Silicon Valley that arguably has more billionaires than anywhere in the world,” Mr. Khanna said, “I have been saying for years, raise their taxes to help build a society with fair opportunity for everyone.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut that is not where the president’s emphasis was. He relegated much of his Build Back Better domestic policy agenda — a nearly $2 trillion smorgasbord of proposed safety net and climate programs that drew unanimous Republican opposition and fractured his own party — to a single line item in the budget document, with no price tag and no detail, leaving it to Congress to determine if any of it could be salvaged. And he made a concerted effort to take the sting out of the issues of crime and immigration that Republicans have been using against Democrats.Far from defunding the police and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, two popular slogans on the left, the budget robustly funds both. Customs and Border Protection would receive $15.3 billion and ICE $8.1 billion, including $309 million for border security technology — a well-funded effort to stop illegal migration. The nation’s two primary immigration law enforcement agencies would see increases of around 13 percent.The budget even includes $19 million for border fencing and other infrastructure.Federal law enforcement would receive $17.4 billion, a jump of nearly 11 percent, or $1.7 billion, over 2021 levels. And the president, acknowledging widespread concerns that are driving Republican attacks against Democrats, vowed to tackle the rise in violent crime.“The answer is not to defund our police departments,” Mr. Biden said at the White House on Monday. “It is to fund our police and give them all the tools they need.”The proposals track with some of the main attack lines Republicans are using against Democrats in the run-up to the November contests, as they portray Mr. Biden and his allies in Congress as weak on security, soft on crime and profligate with federal spending to the point of damaging the economy.Liberal Democrats would see some of their priorities addressed, including substantial funding for climate programs and “environmental justice” initiatives, as well as changes to incarceration policy. But some progressives were left deeply disappointed. In lieu of broad student debt forgiveness, an executive order that many Democrats have been pressing for since Mr. Biden’s inauguration, the Education Department’s student lending services would receive a huge increase, 43 percent, to $2.7 billion.Activist groups that had helped shift the Democratic Party leftward were not giving up. Immigrants’ rights groups calling themselves Defund Hate planned a news conference for Tuesday to “outline their expectations for President Biden to redirect billions in funding from immigration enforcement, militarization and policing toward humane, community-based resources that invest in the true needs of Black, brown and immigrant communities.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Movement for Black Lives denounced a budget that would spend $30 billion on policing and only $367 million on “police reform, the prosecution of hate crimes, enforcement of voting rights and efforts to provide equitable access to justice.”Mr. Biden purposely shrugged such criticism off. “Isn’t it kind of fascinating that when I first got elected, I was being beat up because I supported the police too much for a period of 30 years?” he told reporters when asked if he was responding to Republican attacks. “No, that’s what I think.”Republicans indicated they were not about to shift their lines of attack.“Don’t let Biden’s budget fool you — Biden does not support the police,” said a statement the Republican National Committee issued on Monday. “If he did, he would call on Democrat-run cities to stop undermining law enforcement.”In Congress, Republicans zeroed in on the substance of the budget, not the message, emphasizing that it would increase funding for climate programs and other liberal priorities that did not get much ink beyond the spending tables.“President Biden would rather grind his ideological ax and escalate his holy war on made-in-America fossil fuels,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.Nor do Republicans believe the president can shift the narrative now. The realities of rising prices and violent crime are not likely to change by November, and even if they do, voter perceptions tend to lag.“Kitchen-table issues like rising prices, the economy and public safety will take the front seat in November,” predicted Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund, the main G.O.P. super PAC trying to deliver a Republican majority in November.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDemocratic leaders latched on to the shifting message. The Democratic National Committee on Monday blasted out the headlines it liked, which were decidedly not grandiose. One from Detroit blared, “Biden’s Nearly $6T Budget Aims to Bolster EVs, Great Lakes and PFAS Cleanup,” referring to money for electric vehicles and getting rid of a dangerous manufactured chemical that has tainted water supplies in industrial regions. Another, from Miami, celebrated that “Biden Seeks More Money for Everglades Restoration in 2023 Budget.” In Harrisburg, Pa., the story was, “Biden Lays Out a ‘Fund the Police’ Budget Plan.”","null"

Trump less than three weeks before Jan. 6, 2021, served as a crucial call to action for extremist groups that played a central role in storming the Capitol.Mr. Trump’s Twitter post in the early hours of Dec. 19, 2020, was the first time he publicly urged supporters to come to Washington on the day Congress was scheduled to certify the Electoral College results showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the winner of the presidential vote. His message — which concluded with, “Be there, will be wild!” — has long been seen as instrumental in drawing the crowds that attended a pro-Trump rally on the Ellipse on Jan. 6 and then marched to the Capitol.But the Justice Department’s criminal investigation of the riot and the parallel inquiry by the House select committee have increasingly shown how Mr. Trump’s post was a powerful catalyst, particularly for far-right militants who believed he was facing his final chance to reverse defeat and whose role in fomenting the violence has come under intense scrutiny.Extremist groups almost immediately celebrated Mr. Trump’s Twitter message, which they widely interpreted as an invitation to descend on the city in force. Responding to the president’s words, the groups sprang into action, court filings and interviews by the House committee show: Extremists began to set up encrypted communications channels, acquire protective gear and, in one case, prepare heavily armed “quick reaction forces” to be staged outside Washington.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThey also began to whip up their members with a drumbeat of bellicose language, with their private messaging channels increasingly characterized by what one called an “apocalyptic tone.” Directly after Mr. Trump’s tweet was posted, the Capitol Police began to see a spike in right-wing threats against members of Congress.Prosecutors have included examples in at least five criminal cases of extremists reacting within days — often hours — to Mr. Trump’s post.ImageThe mob attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesOne of those who responded to the post was Guy Wesley Reffitt, an oil-field worker from Texas who this month became the first Jan. 6 defendant to be convicted at trial. Within a day of Mr. Trump’s Twitter post, Mr. Reffitt was talking about it on a private group chat with other members of the far-right militia organization the Texas Three Percenters.“Our President will need us. ALL OF US…!!! On January 6th,” Mr. Reffitt wrote. “We the People owe him that debt. He Sacrificed for us and we must pay that debt.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe next day, prosecutors say, Mr. Reffitt began to make arrangements to travel to Washington and arrive in time for “Armageddon all day” on Jan. 6, he wrote in the Three Percenters group chat. He told his compatriots that he planned to drive because flying was impossible with “all the battle rattle” he planned to bring — a reference to his weapons and body armor, prosecutors say.Some in the group appeared to share his anger. On Dec. 22, one member wrote in the chat, “The only way you will be able to do anything in DC is if you get the crowd to drag the traitors out.”Mr. Reffitt responded: “I don’t think anyone going to DC has any other agenda.”The House committee has also sharpened its focus on how the tweet set off a chain reaction that galvanized Mr. Trump’s supporters to begin military-style planning for Jan. 6. As part of the congressional inquiry, investigators are trying to establish whether there was any coordination beyond the post that ties Mr. Trump’s inner circle to the militants and whether the groups plotted together.“That tweet could be viewed as a call to action,” said Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California and a member of the committee. “It’s definitely something we’re asking questions about through our discussions with witnesses. We want to know whether the president’s tweets inflamed and mobilized individuals to take action.”On the day of the post, participants in TheDonald.win, a pro-Trump chat board, began sharing tactics and techniques for attacking the Capitol, the committee noted in a report released on Sunday recommending contempt of Congress charges for Dan Scavino Jr., Mr. Trump’s former deputy chief of staff. In one thread on the chat board related to the tweet, the report pointed out, an anonymous poster wrote that Mr. Trump “can’t exactly openly tell you to revolt. This is the closest he’ll ever get.’’Lawyers for the militants have repeatedly said that the groups were simply acting defensively in preparing for Jan. 6. They had genuine concerns, the lawyers said, that leftist counterprotesters might confront them, as they had at earlier pro-Trump rallies.Mr. Trump’s post came as his efforts to hang onto power were shifting from the courts, where he had little success, to the streets and to challenging the certification process that would play out on Jan. 6.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA week before his message, thousands of his supporters had arrived in Washington for the second time in two months for a large-scale rally protesting the election results. The event on Dec. 12, 2020, which Mr. Trump flew over in Marine One, showed his ability to draw huge crowds of ordinary people in support of his baseless assertions that the election had been stolen.But it also brought together at the same time and place extremist and paramilitary groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the 1st Amendment Praetorian, who would be present on Jan. 6.On Dec. 14, the Electoral College met and officially declared Mr. Biden the winner of the election.ImageAn event in Washington on Dec. 12, 2020 showed the former president’s ability to draw huge crowds in support of his lies that the election had been stolen.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York TimesBut behind closed doors, outside advisers to Mr. Trump were scrambling to pitch him on plans to seize control of voting machines across the country. The debate over doing so came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting that lasted well into the evening on Dec. 18, 2020, and ended with the idea being put aside.Hours later, the president pushed send on his tweet.“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” he wrote at 1:42 a.m. on Dec. 19. “Be there, will be wild!”Almost at once, shock waves rippled through the right.At 2:26 a.m., the prominent white nationalist Nicholas J. Fuentes wrote on Twitter that he planned to join Mr. Trump in Washington on Jan. 6. By that afternoon, the post had been mentioned or amplified by other right-wing figures like Ali Alexander, a high-profile “Stop the Steal” organizer.But Mr. Trump’s message arguably landed with the greatest impact among members of the same extremist groups that had been in Washington on Dec. 12.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOn Dec. 15, Stewart Rhodes, the leader and founder of the Oath Keepers, posted an open letter to Mr. Trump urging him to invoke the Insurrection Act. The next day, the national council of the Three Percenters Original group issued a statement, saying their members were “standing by to answer the call from our president.”Once the call came, early on Dec. 19, the extremists were ecstatic.ImageStewart Rhodes, the leader and founder of the Oath Keepers, declared a few days after Mr. Trump’s tweet that there would be “a massively bloody revolution” if Joseph R. Biden Jr. ever took office.Credit...Susan Walsh/Associated Press“Trump said It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!! It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!!,” Kelly Meggs, a Florida leader of the Oath Keepers, wrote on Facebook on Dec. 22. “He wants us to make it WILD that’s what he’s saying. He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are heading to DC.”That same day, Mr. Rhodes did an interview with one of his lieutenants and declared that there would be “a massively bloody revolution” if Mr. Biden took office.On Dec. 23, Mr. Rhodes posted another letter saying that “tens of thousands of patriot Americans” would be in Washington on Jan. 6, and that many would have their “mission-critical gear” stowed outside the city.The letter said members of the group — largely composed of former military and law enforcement personnel — might have to “take arms in defense of our God-given liberty.”Capitol Riot’s Aftermath: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4Trump’s tweet. Weeks before the Jan 6 attack, President Donald J. Trump sent a tweet that ended “Be there, will be wild!” Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators have gathered growing evidence of how this tweet was a crucial call to action for militants in the riot.Judge says Trump likely committed crimes. In a court filing in a civil case, the Jan. 6 House committee laid out the crimes it believed Mr. Trump might have committed. The federal judge assigned to the case ruled that Mr. Trump most likely committed felonies in trying to overturn the 2020 election.Virginia Thomas’s text messages. In the weeks before the Capitol riot, Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, sent several texts imploring Mark Meadows, President Trump’s chief of staff, to take steps to overturn the election. The Jan. 6 House committee is likely to seek an interview with Ms. Thomas, said those familiar with the matter.Contempt charges. The Jan. 6 House committee voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro, a former White House adviser, and Dan Scavino Jr., a former deputy chief of staff, for refusing to comply with its subpoenas.By the end of December, court filings say, the Oath Keepers had reserved three hotel rooms in Arlington, Va. The rooms were meant as a staging ground for three teams of armed militiamen poised to rush across the river into Washington on Jan. 6 if needed.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOn New Year’s Eve, court papers say, one team member from Arizona told Mr. Rhodes that his men were ready. “Everyone coming has their own technical equipment and knows how to use it,” the militiaman wrote in an encrypted message to his leader.By then, prosecutors say, Mr. Rhodes seemed set on action.“There is no standard political or legal way out of this,” he wrote to his group.The Proud Boys — who had long been some of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters — also viewed his message as a clarion call, prosecutors say.On the same day it was posted, Joseph Biggs, a Proud Boy leader from Florida, sent a private message to the group’s chairman, Enrique Tarrio, suggesting that they had to start recruiting better members — “not losers who wanna drink,” as he put it.“Let’s get radical and get real men,” Mr. Biggs wrote.ImageThe rally on the National Mall before a mob entered the Capitol.Credit...Pete Marovich for The New York TimesThe next day, Mr. Tarrio established a crew of “hand-selected members” for rallies that was known internally as the Ministry of Self-Defense, or MOSD, according to an indictment released this month. As MOSD turned its attention to Jan. 6, court papers say, Mr. Tarrio set up an encrypted Telegram chat for the group.Two days after Christmas, Charles Donohoe, a Proud Boys leader from North Carolina, posted a message complaining that local officials in Washington appeared to be planning to restrict access to the city on Jan. 6. “They want to limit the presence so they can deny Trump has the People’s support,” Mr. Donohoe wrote. “We can’t let them succeed.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe next week, another MOSD member posted a message reading, “Time to stack those bodies in front of Capitol Hill.” A third member raised the prospect of a mob of “normies” — or normal people — pushing through police lines and breaking into the Capitol. “A few million vs A few hundred coptifa should be enough,” he wrote.At the same time, prosecutors say, other Proud Boys were setting up crowdfunding campaigns for travel expenses and “protective gear and communications.” As the year came to an end, Mr. Tarrio posted a message on social media saying that the Proud Boys intended to “turn out in record numbers on Jan. 6th” but this time “with a twist.”“We will not be wearing our traditional Black and Yellow,” he wrote, a reference to the Fred Perry polo shirts favored by the group. “We will be incognito and we will be spread across downtown DC in smaller teams.”On Dec. 21, the intelligence arm of the Capitol Police issued a 7-page report tracking an increase in activity on TheDonald.win, which made threatening references to potentially trapping lawmakers in the tunnels of the Capitol. The report listed militia groups expected to descend on Capitol Hill for Jan. 6, including the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.The report also stated that Trump supporters were promoting “confronting members of Congress and carrying firearms during the protest.”ImageBroken glass at the entrance of the Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 6.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesIt included more than two dozen comments from posters, including:“Forget the tunnels.

The Biden administration tucked its into the footnotes instead.Months after congressional talks stalled on the president’s expansive climate and social safety net bill known as Build Back Better, the White House simply declined to include its fine print in its annual budget proposal that was released on Monday.The budget included a slew of smaller policy specifics, including a new minimum tax for the very wealthy; a change to the way the government pays for vaccines for adults; and new money to ensure clean drinking water. But it did not include the key provisions in Build Back Better — the legislation that President Biden has spent much of his time in office promoting.White House budgets are always largely symbolic documents, unlikely to become law without substantial changes from Congress.

Such vagueness is not utterly without precedent, but the scope of the omissions this year is unusual.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDuring the Obama administration’s first year in office, as it was developing the health care proposal that would become the Affordable Care Act, it also skipped including key policy details from its budget tables. Similarly, the Trump administration’s first budget offered scant specifics about its ambitions for overhauling the tax code, a priority that came to fruition later that year.But both of those omissions occurred in the administrations’ early months, before White House policy officials or congressional negotiators had time to develop the finer points. Mr. Biden’s domestic policy agenda, in contrast, has been the subject of extensive white papers, policy speeches and legislative text — including a bill that passed the House in November.The tax overhaul and Obamacare were major projects for those administrations, but they did not represent the range of their domestic ambitions in quite the way that Build Back Better does for the Biden White House.The Biden administration’s plan, drawn up as a single piece of legislation that could pass through a special process without requiring Republican votes, included a range of tax, social welfare and climate policy ideas, rolling in much of Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign agenda. Depending on the details, the proposal is likely to increase both spending and revenues by $1 trillion or more over a decade.And while the Trump budget office declined to specify tax details in 2017, it did commit to including substantial cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act as part of its plan to “repeal and replace” the health law.Ironically, the Biden administration’s budget does include proposals, like an increase to the corporate tax rate, that lawmakers have already trimmed from the legislation in their recent negotiations.Last year’s budget featured more of Mr. Biden’s domestic policy plan, detailing programs to combat climate change and expand child care, for example, that did become a part of the Build Back Better proposal.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThis year, the agenda was briefly described in broad terms in the budget’s introductory text. But its role in the document’s detailed breakdowns was limited to footnotes in the summary tables and a line item with no corresponding dollar amount. That budget line allows for unlimited spending and unlimited revenue related to the legislation, so long as it does not increase the federal deficit.The approach gives the White House maneuvering room to negotiate over the details of the package. The legislation was unable to advance in the Senate last year, and any final version will involve painful negotiations among lawmakers. White House officials may not have wanted to signal that they still endorse the whole package when they know it cannot pass — and they may not have wanted to pick and choose among programs without congressional input.The result is a document that excludes any such choices or numbers.“We used to say on the Hill that the president’s budget with the good thick appendix would make a good doorstopper,” said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, who was once a top Republican budget staff member in the Senate. Still, he said, he has always considered the president’s budget important for establishing aspirations.In this case, the budgetary aspiration may be to keep legislative negotiating alive.","null"

Shear","WASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday stood by his comment that Vladimir V. Putin should not remain president of Russia, but he said it was an expression of his own horror over the invasion of Ukraine and not a change in American policy aimed at seeking to remove Mr. Putin from office.“I was expressing the moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it,” Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House, rejecting criticism from around the globe in the last two days about the potential diplomatic consequences of his words. The president said no one should have interpreted his comments as calling for Mr. Putin’s ouster.“It’s ridiculous,” he said of the questions about his speech in Warsaw on Saturday, when he said, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” On Monday, Mr. Biden said: “Nobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that.”The fallout over Mr. Biden’s words in Warsaw underscored the dilemma that he and the NATO allies face about how to condemn the war in Ukraine and pressure Russia without shutting down any relationship with Moscow that might help end the invasion.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe West will also have to decide whether Moscow would be allowed back into the global economy, whether to lift sanctions and how to resume diplomatic relations if Russia pulls back its forces.Mr. Biden’s remark drew some praise for its toughness and clarity but also warnings from lawmakers and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who said on Sunday that “I wouldn’t use this kind of words” when asked about Mr. Biden’s speech. Mr. Macron said he hoped to obtain a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine through diplomacy.Some critics said Mr. Biden’s declaration could make it more difficult to negotiate an end to the 5-week-old war, which has killed thousands in Ukraine and driven millions from their homes.Mr. Biden insisted on Monday that was not the case, although Mr. Putin has told Russians for years that he believes the United States and the C.I.A. are conspiring to remove him from power. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said that Mr. Biden’s statement “makes us worry” and that the Kremlin would “continue to closely monitor” the president’s remarks.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin has told Russians for years that he believes the United States and the C.I.A. are conspiring to remove him from power.Credit...Sputnik, via ReutersIn his speech in Warsaw, Mr. Biden tried to draw a distinction between Mr. Putin’s actions and those of the Russian people, who he said were not responsible for the atrocities being committed by the country’s military in Ukraine each day. He suggested that Russian controls on television and the internet had left the country’s citizens unaware of the truth.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Vladimir Putin’s aggression have cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it’s taking Russia back to the 19th century,” he said. Moments later, he proclaimed that “a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty” before declaring that Mr. Putin should go.The White House appeared to rapidly understand that Mr. Biden’s words could be seen as a reversal of the administration’s long-stated position that it was not seeking regime change in Russia. It took just minutes for officials to back away from Mr. Biden’s comments on Saturday evening. Reporters had just loaded buses after his speech when administration officials sent an email denying that the president was formally advocating Mr. Putin’s removal.On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told journalists in Jerusalem that “we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter.”On Monday, his first extended comments on the matter, Mr. Biden insisted his statement had been misinterpreted.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 11:43 a.m. ET46 minutes ago46 minutes agoThe war is reshaping how Europe’s governments spend.Russian forces arrest an occupied city’s education chief during a struggle over changing the curriculum.Even with signs of progress in peace talks, the fighting continued on several fronts.“The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war or a nuclear war with Russia. That’s not part of it,” Mr. Biden said. “I was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man. It’s outrageous. It’s outrageous. It’s more an aspiration than anything. He shouldn’t be in power.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“People like this shouldn’t be ruling countries, but they do,” he said, adding, “But it doesn’t mean I can’t express my outrage.”Mr. Biden spoke as the violence in Ukraine continued to intensify, with Russian forces appearing determined to cement their territorial gains in the east. In just five weeks, the conflict has killed thousands of civilians, including women and children who have been the victims of intense Russian bombardment. Human rights advocates say more than 3.7 million Ukrainians have fled, creating one of the largest-ever refugee crises across Eastern Europe.The president’s remark on Saturday was not the first time an apparently off-the-cuff comment upended or overshadowed an otherwise tightly scripted White House message.During a news conference earlier on the trip, Mr. Biden said Russia’s use of chemical weapons “would trigger a response in kind,” seeming to suggest that NATO would respond with chemical weapons, which are banned by international law. Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, told reporters the next day that was not what the president meant, saying that the “United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period, under any circumstances.”In January, Mr. Biden created a similar flurry of speculation when he said that the response to a then-potential invasion of Ukraine would depend on whether “it’s a minor incursion.” Mr. Biden eventually corrected himself, saying, “If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.”ImageBefore his speech on Saturday, President Biden visited with refugees from Ukraine at a stadium in Warsaw.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesMr. Biden is no stranger to the nuances of public diplomacy, in which officials — especially heads of state — are careful to speak in very particular ways in an effort to avoid offending another leader or sending an unintended message about policy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAmerican presidents, for example, never refer to Taiwan as an independent nation for fear of provoking anger from the Chinese government. Similar care is taken when talking about the city of Jerusalem, the status of which remains a disputed part of discussions between Israel and the Palestinians.In 2016, when President Barack Obama delivered a eulogy at the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former Israeli president, a White House stenographer initially indicated that the remarks had been given in “Jerusalem, Israel.” After that created a minor flap, the remarks were amended to remove the reference to Israel.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. Russia said that it would sharply “reduce military activity” near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. The announcement was the first sign of progress to emerge from peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.Biden’s comments. During a speech in Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said that President Vladimir V. Putin “cannot remain in power,” sending U.S. officials scrambling to walk back the ad-lib. On Monday, Mr. Biden stood by his remark, but said it was a personal expression of his “moral outrage.”President Donald J. Trump repeatedly violated many of the diplomatic rules in what aides said was a deliberate attempt to shake up the way foreign policy was conducted. He called the leader of North Korea “Rocket Man,” formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and took steps to more formally deal with Taiwan in the final days of his administration.Since taking office, Mr. Biden has made it a priority to return to a more traditional form of diplomacy in which the United States seeks to work with adversaries like Russia even as the administration challenges actions by Mr. Putin that it finds objectionable.But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tested that approach. During the past several weeks, Mr. Biden has grown increasingly vocal in his condemnation of Mr. Putin, using more aggressive language as the Russian leader has escalated his attacks on Ukraine.A week ago, he called Mr. Putin “a war criminal” before the United States had officially made that determination. Before his speech on Saturday, Mr. Biden visited with refugees from Ukraine at a stadium in Warsaw and called Mr. Putin “a butcher” because of the deaths caused by shelling in Mariupol, a hard-hit city in the eastern part of the country.That kind of language has helped Mr. Biden unite American allies behind a coordinated set of responses to Mr. Putin’s aggression, including some of the most severe sanctions ever levied on a large, developed nation. The president’s condemnations have been echoed over the past several weeks by other world leaders.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut it remains a delicate balance as the administration tries not to provoke Mr. Putin into engaging in a broader conflict with NATO countries. Mr. Biden has said repeatedly that such engagements could lead to World War III.In his remarks to reporters on Monday, the president said it was his visit with the refugees just hours earlier that led to his comment about Mr. Putin not staying in power.“Half the children in Ukraine,” he said, apparently referring to the number of children who are estimated to have become refugees because of the war. “I had just come from being with those families.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/28/us/politics/28dc-prexy-putin/merlin_203935944_3730968e-4654-4665-94cd-0c1e5d2a0d50-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"
