Some protested at the gates of housing complexes that were locked with little notice. Others, sent to government isolation facilities, were forced to sleep on the floor because of a shortage of beds.For still others, the city’s Covid-19 restrictions have had life-threatening implications. Some residents have been confined at home, unable to get kidney dialysis or other urgent treatment. A nurse who suffered an asthma attack died after she was denied care by a hospital that cited Covid prevention protocols.Officials had tried to limit disruptions by confining buildings or neighborhoods, arguing that a full-scale lockdown in the city of 26 million was untenable. Officials said their more surgical approach would curb the outbreak while preserving economic life in Shanghai, a hub for international business.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThen, on Sunday evening, the city’s officials signaled that doing both at once might no longer be feasible. The city declared a staggered lockdown that closed nonessential businesses, halted public transportation and confined the majority of the population to their homes.The measures split the city in half, first closing the eastern section for a five-day quarantine starting Monday, before turning to a similar shutdown in the western portion. Shanghai’s caseload of 3,500 on Monday was tiny compared with much of the world, but it has been driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Officials said the lockdown would enable the authorities to conduct mass testing.ImageLining up for eggs  in Shanghai on Monday. Residents have raced to hoard supplies in case they were ordered to stay home.Credit...Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesChina has been grappling with the country’s largest outbreak since the pandemic began in Wuhan more than two years ago. The government’s fear is that an uncontrolled spread could overwhelm hospitals and cause a catastrophic loss of life. Large numbers of Chinese adults 80 and older are unvaccinated, and there is little immunity from earlier infections. Hong Kong’s struggle to contain a Covid outbreak has offered a glimpse of what that might look like: Deaths there spiked in recent weeks, particularly among unvaccinated older adults.“The challenge is that lockdowns and nucleic testing demand manpower and medical resources in addition to their impact on the economy and life in general,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The leadership is trying hard to continue the current practices but are also assessing. But Omicron may very well force the hand of the leadership” to abandon its unsustainable reliance on lockdowns, he said. The government has been working on administering vaccine boosters for the elderly and buying anti-viral drugs to prepare for such a scenario, he said.The central government is still pushing officials across the country to stamp out the virus, deploying measures that are among the world’s strictest, including isolating anyone who tests positive and enforcing quarantines on people deemed at risk of infection. White-collar employees, shoppers and diners have been forced to isolate inside offices, stores and restaurants if they were deemed to be close contacts. People who test positive are sent either to hospitals or to government isolation facilities set up in schools, exhibition centers and other spaces.In Shanghai, though, signs abound that the policy, and the populace, are stretched thin.Ivy Sun, a 32-year-old counselor, had been looking forward to freedom after being held in her home under a five-day lockdown on her neighborhood. On Sunday, after the announcement of the citywide closure, she was suddenly allowed a breath of fresh air, but just for seven hours. She and her neighbors rushed out to get groceries and other supplies for yet another confinement.“It felt like an apocalyptic scene. Everyone ran out. A lot of people were on the streets near the neighborhood, and all the stores were filled with people,” Ms. Sun said.Image Shanghai has announced a staggered lockdown to conduct mass testing. Credit...Aly Song/ReutersMs. Sun said that during her first lockdown, she couldn’t get groceries online because they sold out quickly. She and her neighbors got together and began buying necessities in bulk. She also wondered whether the panic-buying on Sunday, in which people crammed together inside enclosed stores, could have worsened the spread of the virus.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 10:41 a.m. ET2 hours ago2 hours agoThe F.D.A. authorizes second Covid booster shots for those 50 and older, and some immunocompromised people.Here’s how Shanghai’s lockdown is testing China’s ‘Covid-zero’ policy, and people’s limits.Experts warn of racial disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of long Covid.In other cases, the unpredictability of the restrictions and seemingly indefinite confinement triggered protests. In central Shanghai, around two dozen residents of Jinghua Xinyuan, an apartment complex, crowded in front of a marble and metal security gate that was locked to prevent them from leaving.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We want to get out,” several residents shouted at police officers posted outside on Sunday afternoon, according to a video posted to Weibo that day and verified by The New York Times.The authorities had locked residents in the compound for three days, yet did not administer Covid tests even though some people had the virus, according to residents’ accounts posted online. They had given conflicting messages about how long this would go on, the residents complained.“The day before yesterday, they told us the 14-day lockdown had started. Yesterday, they said that the 14 days started yesterday, and today they said it started today,” shouted one man who wore a black cap and a sweatshirt. “Am I on a cruise at sea or what?”Calls to the neighborhood committee and the management office of the complex rang unanswered on Tuesday. A duty officer who answered the phone at the Xuhui district police station denied that there had been a protest.While the authorities have been quick to enforce isolation and home quarantine on residents, they have lagged in ensuring that all those in confinement can get help for serious medical conditions. Many residents have resorted to going online to beg for access to treatment such as dialysis.ImageThe Covid outbreak in Shanghai has prompted a rush for groceries, leaving shelves empty at many stores.Credit...Alex Plavevski/EPA, via ShutterstockLuker Dong, a resident in Pudong, said that his 73-year-old father suffered from uremia — a buildup of toxins in the blood — that required him to get hemodialysis at a hospital three times a week. But he has been forced to go without treatment for four days since his building went under lockdown, Mr. Dong said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHospitals also would not accept his father, citing concerns about the outbreak, and the health authorities have not helped, he said. His father’s feet had swollen without the dialysis, which helps to filter waste and water from his blood.“If his organs fail, it will be too late,” Mr. Dong said in a telephone interview. Mr. Dong has posted calls for help on his Weibo page, saying on Monday: “I cannot just watch my father wait for his death at home.”Shanghai’s top health authorities have said that hospitals should ensure people who require treatments like dialysis and chemotherapy can get help while in lockdown. But cases like that of Mr. Dong’s father exposed gaps in the system.Such scenes and complaints were common in Wuhan and the province of Hubei when the outbreak first emerged because the health care system there was quickly overwhelmed. In Shanghai, where hospitals are among the country’s best, accounts of residents being denied treatment because of Covid measures have similarly stirred widespread anger and grief.Last week, a nurse suffered an asthma attack but couldn’t get help from the emergency department at the hospital where she worked because it was closed for Covid disinfection. Her family rushed her to another hospital but she died, according to a statement from Shanghai East Hospital, her employer.ImageThe central government is pushing officials across the country to stamp out the virus, deploying measures that are among the world’s strictest.Credit...Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOn Friday, officials from Shanghai’s health commission expressed condolences to the nurse’s family. They urged hospitals to speed up infection screening, contact tracing and disinfection protocols to minimize disruptions to normal medical services.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyStill, Feng Wenliang, a reporter at the state-run China Food Security Newspaper, described the nurse’s death as shameful. “This slap was extremely loud,” he wrote on his social media account.“It has been three years since the pandemic, for such a thing to happen in Shanghai, which is at the forefront of national prevention and control,” he added. “Their own nurse was sick, and the hospital where she worked refused to accept her.”“She was a nurse, but even more a patient.”Li You contributed research."

Yet with the economy growing faster than in decades, demand for labor has outpaced the availability of workers — at least at the wages and benefits employers are offering.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThere are still roughly three million or so people who have not returned to the work force, according to the government data.“Looking at how poorly our labor force has grown so far this year, if companies want to win the war for talent they need to engage the people who may not be actively seeking work right now, or be the first option people see when they do return,” Ron Hetrick, a senior economist at Emsi Burning Glass, a data and research company, wrote in a note.That echoes the sentiment of many unions and labor activists, who have been saying that even though wage growth has picked up, people aren’t feeling valued enough by employers. It’s led to fresh questions about how bosses might get to know the “love language” of their hires and find sometimes unconventional ways to show them that they care. There are also more straightforward requests: Several progressive economists have noted that employers could, for instance, take some jobs generally expected to be low-wage — such as fast food service and cashiers — and entice workers by offering higher pay and better benefits.Large public companies and small businesses alike often say that they have already substantially raised pay from before the pandemic and that with inflation raging at highs unseen since the early 1980s, raw material and other costs have made business more difficult. An expensive surge in commodity markets suggests that price increases for food and energy could worsen, especially if firms raise prices further.Still, despite widespread frustration with inflation and shortages of some products and materials, some surveys suggest businesses are becoming more optimistic about the future. The MetLife and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Index recently reached a pandemic-era high, with about three in five of the small business owners surveyed saying their business is in good health."

Yet even he did not imagine the need to spend millions of dollars for emergency production of iodine pills to help block radiation poisoning in case of a nuclear blast, or to raise military spending by 25 percent in a single year.“We never thought we’d need to go back to the Cold War and consider potassium iodine again,” Mr. Ciuca, a retired general, said through a translator at Victoria Palace, the government’s headquarters in Bucharest. “We never expected this kind of war in the 21st century.”Across the European Union and Britain, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is reshaping spending priorities and forcing governments to prepare for threats thought to have been long buried — from a flood of European refugees to the possible use of chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons by a Russian leader who may feel backed into a corner.The result is a sudden reshuffling of budgets as military spending, essentials like agriculture and energy, and humanitarian assistance are shoved to the front of the line, with other pressing needs like education and social services likely to be downgraded.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe most significant shift is in military spending. Germany’s turnabout is the most dramatic, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s promise to raise spending above 2 percent of the country’s economic output, a level not reached in more than three decades. The pledge included an immediate injection of 100 billion euros — $113 billion — into the country’s notoriously threadbare armed forces. As Mr. Scholz put it in his speech last month: “We need planes that fly, ships that sail and soldiers who are optimally equipped.”The commitment is a watershed moment for a country that has sought to leave behind an aggressive military stance that contributed to two devastating world wars.Image“We never thought we’d need to go back to the Cold War and consider potassium iodine again,” said Nicolae Ciuca, prime minister of Romania.Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York TimesA wartime mind-set has also spread to sectors aside from defense. With prices soaring for oil, animal feed and fertilizer, Ireland introduced a “wartime tillage” program last week to amp up grain production, and created a National Fodder and Food Security Committee to manage threats to the food supply.Farmers will be paid up to €400 for every additional 100-acre block that is planted with a cereal crop like barley, oats or wheat. Planting additional protein crops like peas and beans will earn a €300 subsidy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The illegal invasion in Ukraine has put our supply chains under enormous pressure,” Charlie McConalogue, the agriculture minister, said in announcing the $13.2 million package. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat and with Ukraine accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports.Spain has been running down its supplies of corn, sunflower oil and some other produce that also come from Russia and Ukraine. “We’ve got stock available, but we need to make purchases in third countries,” Luis Planas, the agriculture minister, told a parliamentary committee.Mr. Planas has asked the European Commission to ease some rules on Latin American farm imports, like genetically modified corn for animal feed from Argentina, to offset the lack of supply.Extraordinarily high energy prices have also put intense pressure on governments to cut excise taxes or approve subsidies to ease the burden on families that can’t afford to heat every room in their home or fill their car’s gas tank.Ireland reduced gasoline taxes, and approved an energy credit and a lump-sum payment for lower-income households. Germany announced tax breaks and a $330-per-person energy subsidy, which will end up costing the treasury $17.5 billion.ImageIreland introduced a “wartime tillage” program last week to increase grain production.Credit...Niall Carson - PA Images, via Getty ImagesIn Spain, the government agreed last week to defray the cost of gasoline in response to several days of strikes by truckers and fishermen, which left supermarkets without fresh supplies of some of their most basic items.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAnd in Britain, a cut in fuel taxes and support for poorer households will cost $3.2 billion.The outlook is a change from October, when Rishi Sunak, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, announced a budget for what he called an “economy fit for a new age of optimism,” with large increases in education, health and job training.In his latest update to Parliament, Mr. Sunak warned that “we should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen potentially significantly,” as the country faces the biggest drop in living standards it has ever seen.The energy tax relief was welcomed by the public, but the reduced revenues put even more pressure on governments that are already managing record high debt levels.“The problem is that some countries have quite a big chunk of legacy debt — in Italy and France, it’s over 100 percent of gross domestic product,” said Lucrezia Reichlin, an economics professor at the London Business School, referring to the huge amounts spent to respond to the pandemic. “That is something which is very much new for the economic governance of the union.” European Union rules, which were temporarily suspended in 2020 because of the coronavirus, limit government debt to 60 percent of a country’s economic output.And the demands on budgets are only increasing. European Union leaders said this month that the bill for new defense and energy spending could run as high as $2.2 trillion.The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global EconomyCard 1 of 6Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion.  Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.For Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the costs are enormous. The coalition government has committed $1.7 billion to buy more liquefied natural gas and is investing nearly as much in building a permanent L.N.G. terminal and renting several floating ones in order to reduce its dependence on Russian fuel. At the same time, it has agreed to keep coal-fired power plants in reserve, even as it earmarked nearly $220 billion over the next four years to revive the country’s transition to renewable energy sources.ImageGerman soldiers training in Lithuania this month. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised to increase Germany’s military spending.Credit...Andrea Mantovani for The New York TimesGermany’s energy supply is “at a historical turning point” as it moves away from Russian fuel, Deutsche Bank Research said in a market note last week. The energy links that have endured decades — “even during the hottest times of the Cold War — are to be loosened in the years to come.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAnd then there is the cost of humanitarian aid to help settle the 3.7 million refugees from Ukraine who have streamed across the border. Estimates for housing, transporting, feeding and processing the flood of people have run as high as $30 billion in the first year alone.Some countries have gone further. Poland and Romania have extended the same educational, health and social services to refugees that their own citizens enjoy.Budgets are ultimately more than a mind-numbing compilation of numbers. They are the most meaningful declaration of a nation’s priorities, a reflection of its values.The Russian invasion of Ukraine has transformed and clarified those.The European Union agreed this month to “increase substantially defense expenditures” and “invest further in the capabilities necessary to conduct the full range of missions.”The pledge includes countries that have fallen below NATO’s goal to spend a minimum of 2 percent of national output as well as countries that have exceeded the threshold. (The 27 members of the European Union and the 30 NATO members overlap but are not identical.)A French parliamentary report published in February, a week before the invasion, concluded that in the event of large-scale conventional war, like one in Ukraine, an additional $44 billion to $66 billion over 12 years would be needed to bolster France’s military machine. President Emmanuel Macron has pledged a sharp increase in military spending — which is already $45 billion, more than 10 percent of the government’s total budget — if he wins the presidential election next month.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyKaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, wrote in an essay published last week in The New York Times that “this year, we’ll spend 2.3 percent of G.D.P.; in the coming years, that will rise to 2.5 percent.”Belgium, Italy, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden — a militarily neutral country that is not a part of NATO — have also announced increases to their defense budgets.“It’s our responsibility to take measure to protect ourselves,” said Mr. Ciuca, the Romanian prime minister. No one knows how long the war in Ukraine will continue, “but we have to reassess and adapt to what might happen in the future,” he added. “We have to be prepared for the unexpected.”Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid, Liz Alderman from Paris and Melissa Eddy from Berlin."

Goodman","In a world contending with no end of economic troubles, a fresh source of concern now looms: the prospect of a confrontation between union dockworkers and their employers at some of the most critical ports on earth.The potential conflict centers on negotiations over a new contract for more than 22,000 union workers employed at 29 ports along the West Coast of the United States. Nearly three-fourths work at the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the primary gateway for goods shipped to the United States from Asia, and a locus of problems afflicting the global supply chain.The contract for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union expires at the end of June. For those whose livelihoods are tied to ports — truckers, logistics companies, retailers — July 1 marks the beginning of a period of grave uncertainty.A labor impasse could worsen the floating traffic jams that have kept dozens of ships waiting in the Pacific before they can pull up to the docks. That could aggravate shortages and send already high prices for consumer goods soaring.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySome port workers accuse the longshoremen of adding to the chaos at the ports in the lead-up to their contract negotiations, boosting their leverage with the terminal operators while stymieing the flow of cargo for everyone else.“Every time there’s a contract up, things slow down,” said Anthony Chilton, 55, who drives a truck hauling containers between the ports and warehouses of Southern California. “We always blame the longshoremen. They slack off, take breaks, call in sick.”ImageAnthony Chilton drives a truck hauling containers between the ports and warehouses in the Los Angeles area.Credit...Alex Welsh for The New York TimesAmong those who work on the docks, such depictions fuel grievous resentment. The longshoremen say they have no intention of slowing or halting work that is at once economically vital, physically exhausting and dangerous — work that they have pursued uninterrupted through the worst pandemic in a century.“When everybody else was shutting down, we didn’t stop,” said Jesse Lopez, the secretary and treasurer of I.L.W.U. Local 13. “We knew that the American people needed their products.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyEven in quieter times, the prospect of union negotiations at some of the world’s busiest ports presents the legitimate possibility of a significant impediment to world trade. These are not quiet times.With ports consumed by traffic and Americans bemoaning inflation, the longshoremen grasp that their leverage may be uniquely potent. An impasse or a strike could deal another shock to the global economy, just as the world is grappling with the impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and as China imposes new Covid restrictions on industry.Understand the Supply Chain CrisisThe Origins of the Crisis: The pandemic created worldwide economic turmoil. We broke down how it happened.Explaining the Shortages: Why is this happening? When will it end? Here are some answers to your questions.A New Normal?: The chaos at ports, warehouses and retailers will probably persist through 2022, and perhaps even longer.A Key Factor in Inflation: In the U.S., inflation is hitting its highest level in decades. Supply chain issues play a big role.The dockworkers have moved unprecedented volumes of cargo during the pandemic, even as at least two dozen succumbed to Covid-19, according to the union. They are aware that many of the shipping terminals in Southern California are controlled by global carriers that have been racking up record profits while sharply increasing cargo rates — a fact cited by President Biden in his recent State of the Union address as he promised a “crackdown” to alleviate inflation.With ports now capturing attention in Washington, some within the shipping industry express confidence that negotiations will yield a deal absent a disruptive slowdown or strike.“There’s too much at stake for both sides,” Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, said during a recent interview in his office overlooking towering cranes and stacks of containers. “There’s an incentive because the nation is watching.”ImageShipping containers stacked high on docks, waiting to be sorted and loaded onto trucks.Credit...Coley Brown for The New York TimesBut others in the industry cite history as a cautionary tale. The last time the union’s contract expired, in 2014, the result was pronounced turmoil at the ports. This time, odds for a deal without drama are “50-50,” declared Jim McKenna, the chief executive of the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents the shipping terminals in talks with the union.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The last four contracts ended up in some sort of disruption,” he said.Major retailers that import products from Asia have been ordering extra goods as a hedge against a breakdown in contract talks, while stockpiling their wares at newly developed storage yards inside the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, said Sepehr Matinifar, vice president of commercial operations at Pacific Terminal Services, which operates the overflow yards.Walmart alone has room for 4,000 shipping containers there, he said.“There are concerns that if there is a strike, they are not going to have access to their cargo,” Mr. Matinifar said, straining to make himself heard over the clattering boom of heavy equipment depositing metal boxes onto the pavement.Still, he expressed confidence that a deal would be achieved. If the unions push too hard, he said, the shipping carriers will move cargo to fast-growing ports on the Atlantic like Savannah, Ga.“If they don’t come to a compromise, then freight will get permanently diverted to the East Coast,” Mr. Matinifar said.Animating contract talks is the popular notion that the longshoremen are a privileged class within the supply chain, using the union to protect their ranks — a source of resentment among other workers.“They treat us like we’re nobodies,” said Mr. Chilton, the truck driver. “The way they talk to us, they’re very rude.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe dockworkers are some of the best-compensated blue-collar workers in American industry. So-called Class A longshoremen, who have pensions and benefits along with guaranteed hours, routinely earn more than $100,000 a year. Even “casual workers” — those guaranteed no shifts — begin at more than $32 an hour.ImageA cargo ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles.Credit...Coley Brown for The New York TimesImageJesse Lopez, a dockworkers’ union official, said workers were entitled to good pay given the dangers and rigors of their jobs.Credit...Coley Brown for The New York Times“You get in here, you’re not going to want to go anywhere else,” Mr. Lopez, the Local 13 officer, said as hundreds of workers gathered before dawn inside a union hall near the Port of Long Beach on a recent morning, waiting to select their daily assignments. “You’re going to get a check every Friday because there’s work.”His father labored on the docks until the mid-1990s, when he suffered a heart attack while he was climbing a crane, falling more than 50 feet. The accident ended his working life.Mr. Lopez inherited his father’s union slot. In the 27 years since, his wages have allowed him to buy a three-bedroom house with a swimming pool, where he raised two daughters.“I’m able to take care of my family,” Mr. Lopez said.He and his fellow longshoremen make no apologies for their pay — the fruits of maintaining labor solidarity in an era of declining union power, they assert. That their comfortable earnings stand out as exceptional says less about them and more about the comprehensive downgrading of much of the American work force.They also portray their pay as due recompense for the hazards of their jobs.“You don’t get hurt down here,” Mr. Lopez said. “You get killed.”ImageAt the Port of Oakland in California.

More times than he can recall, he has had to knock on the doors of fallen dockworkers, standing next to their partners and children, to “let them know that their loved one is not coming home tonight.”How the Supply Chain Crisis UnfoldedCard 1 of 9The pandemic sparked the problem. The highly intricate and interconnected global supply chain is in upheaval. Much of the crisis can be traced to the outbreak of Covid-19, which triggered an economic slowdown, mass layoffs and a halt to production. Here’s what happened next:A reduction in shipping. With fewer goods being made and fewer people with paychecks to spend at the start of the pandemic, manufacturers and shipping companies assumed that demand would drop sharply. But that proved to be a mistake, as demand for some items would surge.Demand for protective gear spiked. In early 2020, the entire planet suddenly needed surgical masks and gowns. Most of these goods were made in China. As Chinese factories ramped up production, cargo vessels began delivering gear around the globe.Then, a shipping container shortage. Shipping containers piled up in many parts of the world after they were emptied. The result was a shortage of containers in the one country that needed them the most: China, where factories would begin pumping out goods in record volumes.Demand for durable goods increased. The pandemic shifted Americans’ spending from eating out and attending events to office furniture, electronics and kitchen appliances – mostly purchased online. The spending was also encouraged by government stimulus programs.Strained supply chains. Factory goods swiftly overwhelmed U.S. ports. Swelling orders further outstripped the availability of shipping containers, and the cost of shipping a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles skyrocketed tenfold.Labor shortages. Businesses across the economy, meanwhile, struggled to hire workers, including the truck drivers needed to haul cargo to warehouses. Even as employers resorted to lifting wages, labor shortages persisted, worsening the scarcity of goods.Component shortages. Shortages of one thing turned into shortages of others. A dearth of computer chips, for example, forced major automakers to slash production, while even delaying the manufacture of medical devices.A lasting problem. Businesses and consumers reacted to shortages by ordering earlier and extra, especially ahead of the holidays, but that has placed more strain on the system. These issues are a key factor in rising inflation and are likely to last through 2022 — if not longer.Union officials declined to discuss their objectives for a new contract.Mr. McKenna, the maritime association chief executive, said the union had yet to outline demands while declining to engage in discussions before May.He expected that the union would resist efforts to expand automation at the ports, a traditional point of contention. He said greater automation — such as adding self-driving vehicles and robotics to move cargo — was unavoidable in ports in dense urban places like Los Angeles. There, land is tight, so growth must come from increasing efficiency, rather than physically expanding.The last time the I.L.W.U. contract expired, West Coast ports suffered months of debilitating disruptions — the source of enduring recriminations.Terminal operators accused dockworkers of slowing operations to generate pressure for a deal. The union countered that employers were the ones creating problems.Some dockworkers question whether terminal owners are sincerely seeking to speed up cargo handling, given that shipping rates have soared amid chaos at the ports.ImageJaime Hipsher driving a utility tractor rig, which moves containers on the docks.Credit...Coley Brown for The New York TimesImageGlobal carriers have been racking up record profits while dramatically increasing cargo rates.Credit...Coley Brown for The New York TimesAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyJaime Hipsher, 45, drives a so-called utility tractor rig — equipment used to move containers — at a pair of Southern California shipping terminals.

The city’s director of transportation would then need to authorize it, paving the way for Uber and Flywheel, which operates an app used by hundreds of taxi drivers in San Francisco across several taxi companies to accept rides. The agreement, after a similar partnership between Uber and taxi companies in New York City was announced last week, would mark an abrupt departure from the years of fierce fighting between the two groups. If approved by regulators, the partnership in San Francisco could begin as soon as May.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyUber has called the taxi industry corrupt and greedy, and a San Francisco taxi company once sued Uber in federal court, accusing it of predatory pricing practices. Some taxi drivers are pushing back against the idea of a partnership, worried that it would lead to lower earnings and make it more difficult for longtime taxi customers to get affordable rides.The agreement is particularly surprising because San Francisco, Uber’s hometown, has been among a group of cities that have at times aggressively resisted Uber’s business. Uber, along with other companies that use gig workers, like Lyft and DoorDash, backed California’s Proposition 22, a measure that gave gig workers some limited benefits but prohibited them from being considered full employees. Though the measure passed statewide in 2020, before a judge threw it out last year, San Francisco was one of the few counties where a majority of voters opposed it.In recent years, Uber has struck partnerships with taxi firms, mostly outside the United States. The company said in February that it had added 122,000 taxis to its platform last year. More About Uber Bouncing Back: After a pandemic-induced slump, the company reported in February a sharp rise in revenue from a year earlier. New Partnership: The company is teaming up with two companies in New York City to offer users the option of riding in a yellow taxi.Legislative Efforts: Uber and Lyft are seeking to shield their business model by backing bills that would classify drivers as contractors in exchange for a union. Interview: Jill Hazelbaker, a top executive, helped Uber weather sexual assault accusations. Here she talks about what it took.The taxi industry had lost customers to ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft even before the pandemic drastically reduced travel demand. The number of taxis in operation fell to 400 during the pandemic — from 1,300 — before recovering to 600, the Municipal Transportation Agency said. Teaming up with Uber could give taxi drivers access to a much larger pool of riders, while Uber would gain supply in the form of hundreds of taxi drivers.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyLast year, San Francisco approved a test program that would allow passengers who ordered a taxi using an app to receive a guaranteed upfront cost, similar to how Uber and Lyft function. The goal was to help taxi drivers earn more money, in part by countering a phenomenon called meter anxiety — the idea that the unease of watching a ride’s cost increase in real time on a taxi meter prompts riders to cancel a trip or avoid calling a taxi in the first place. The upfront cost was required to be the same as the trip’s cost if calculated using a meter.ImageUber is based in San Francisco, where it has faced some of its stiffest opposition.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesNow Uber wants to join this experiment, with a twist: If San Francisco approves so-called “third-party dispatch services” like Uber to participate, the upfront cost that Uber charges customers to get a taxi through its app will not be required to be the same as a metered taxi ride. That means they could charge the same price as a typical UberX car ride, which is often cheaper than a taxi ride.That has some San Francisco taxi drivers concerned that they will be offered cheap rides that earn them only a few dollars. Others worry that surge pricing — when Uber elevates rates at times of high demand — could price current low-income taxi customers out of getting rides.“It’s just not right,” said Evelyn Engel, an executive board member at the San Francisco Taxi Workers Alliance, which backs taxi drivers. She said she and other taxi drivers had heard from the city’s transportation agency about Uber’s involvement in the pilot program.“Uber is going to get hundreds of full-time drivers on their platform,” Ms. Engel said, but taxi drivers are “not going to even get paid a per-ride fare that allows for a dignified living.”Muwaffaq Mustafa, 53, who has been a taxi driver for decades and now also runs operations for Flywheel Taxi — the company that once sued Uber — said he thought the Uber partnership would enrich taxi drivers and could help save a floundering industry. The slightly cheaper rides, he said, would be offset by greater demand.“I’m optimistic if this deal goes through we will make up for all these years that were down,” Mr. Mustafa said. “More calls, more value, and it’s more money.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyGeorge Lama, 60, a taxi driver in San Francisco for 20 years, said the partnership was needed because passengers now completely ignored taxis. He waits outside hotels in a line of cabdrivers to pick people up, he said, but they order Ubers instead.“No one is looking at us because they’re conditioned that Uber is quicker, a larger fleet, cheaper,” Mr. Lama said.In December, Hansu Kim, the president and a co-owner of the Flywheel taxi-hailing app, told a panel at a transportation regulators’ conference that the taxi industry’s approach to technology was like “dinosaurs that are still in the tar pits,” and that he was talking with Uber to help taxi drivers get access to ride-hailing customers.“If we do not co-opt this technology as a standard, we are going to continue to be marginalized,” Mr. Kim said in video of the meeting, which was viewed by The Times.Uber could benefit from the partnership by gaining access to potentially hundreds more drivers; although it said it had seen driver numbers rebound in recent months after many left during the height of the pandemic, many drivers still complain of low earnings and some said they had quit the platform or started driving less as gas prices have risen.The Municipal Transportation Agency says taxi drivers will benefit, too. “The taxi industry is leveraging Uber’s large riding population and pushing that toward the taxi industry,” Forest Barnes, an transportation planner for the agency, told taxi drivers in a recent Zoom meeting viewed by The Times.If taxi drivers do see more money through the partnership, that could encourage some ride-hailing drivers to consider operating taxis instead. But some taxi drivers are balking at the merger.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMarcelo Fonseca, 62, said he would rather “drive empty” than participate in driving passengers for Uber or Lyft. “My morals, ethics and principles would never allow me to be part of that,” he said."

The cost for millions of children has been incalculable.By Ellen Gabler","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/us/lead-poisoning-insurance-landlords.html","How 2 Industries Stymied Justice for Young Lead Paint Victims","null","Ellen Gabler","When Selena Wiley signed the lease for an older rental home in South Bend, Ind., she asked the property manager about lead paint and was assured the house was safe.But in November 2018 — almost two years after moving in with her partner and three children — Ms. Wiley noticed that their 2-year-old’s appetite had vanished and his constant chattering had stopped.A doctor soon discovered that the boy, Joevonne, known as J.J., had lead poisoning. The level was so high that he immediately began a 19-day treatment to help rid his body of the toxin, which can cause irreversible damage to a child’s brain and nervous system. A health inspector soon found lead paint and dust throughout the family’s rental home.As J.J. faces an uncertain future, no one has been held responsible so far — the firm that owns the home protected its assets in a tangle of limited liability companies, and the property insurer excluded lead from its coverage. These practices are now the norm across the United States, The New York Times has found, part of a decades-long campaign by the real estate and insurance industries to shield themselves from liability in lead-poisoning cases. The effort has helped allow what is often considered a problem of the past to remain a silent epidemic today.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAlthough lead poisoning has decreased substantially since the late 1970s as a result of regulatory actions and public health initiatives, about 500,000 children under 6 have elevated blood lead levels in the United States and are at risk of harm. The issue has only intensified in the era of Covid-19: Rental inspections lagged, exposure increased as people spent more time at home and testing of children fell by 50 percent at times in 2020.“It’s a slow-moving catastrophe that people have just gotten used to,” said Sean M. Ryan, a state senator in western New York, where high rates of lead poisoning persist.Children in the U.S. With Elevated Blood Lead LevelsNo level of exposure to lead is considered safe. Even low levels have been shown to affect a child’s intelligence, learning ability and behavior. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently lowered the threshold used to identify children with the highest lead levels.
      
    






















    

























          Previous threshold About 150,000 children nationwide have lead levels at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter, the C.D.C.’s previous mark for identifying children with elevated levels of the toxic metal. (Each figure represents 500 children.)  Current threshold In October, the C.D.C. lowered the mark to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter, which results in about 350,000 additional children considered to have high levels. 

          
          



















Source: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Centers for Disease Control and Preventionby Michael H. KellerNot only is the illness a scourge in many of the country’s poorer ZIP codes, but families like J.J.’s have less recourse than ever. Over the years, children often received settlements or court judgments to help pay for health care, therapy and tutoring as they struggled with the life-altering effects of lead poisoning. The payments also served as a warning to landlords to make sure their properties were safe.But with little public attention and the approval of state officials, insurance companies across the country excluded lead from their policies, declining to pay out when children were poisoned on properties they covered, according to interviews with health and housing officials, regulators and lawyers who represented children and their families. The move also eased pressure on landlords to fix up their rentals.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWithout insurance, there is little chance of recovering money for a child when a landlord has few resources. Property owners who do have substantial holdings have found ways to legally distance themselves from problem rentals, increasingly using L.L.C.s to hide assets and identities. In 2019, for example, a Virginia family that had been awarded a $2 million judgment agreed to accept just $140,000 after the landlord, a major developer, dodged collection efforts.As a result, plaintiffs’ lawyers — who often work on contingency, fronting costs and collecting payment only if there is a favorable judgment or settlement — are increasingly declining to file lawsuits.If not for the obstacles, “I would still be getting up in front of juries,” said Richard Serpe, a lawyer who represented the Virginia family and stopped taking lead cases last year after working on them for three decades. “We have shifted the burden to the people least able to handle it, which is these kids.”The issue of lead poisoning has taken on new urgency: In October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered the threshold for identifying those at risk, meaning many more children will be found to have elevated lead levels. In New York State alone, that number would almost double, from about 6,000 new cases a year to about 11,500, according to health data reviewed by The Times.No exposure to lead is considered safe, and even low levels have been shown to affect a child’s intelligence, learning ability and behavior, according to the C.D.C. Repercussions can be lifelong, and taxpayers end up footing much of the cost of care — billions of dollars annually for medical treatment and special education.The ultimate goal is to fix lead hazards so children are not exposed at all, which local, state and federal agencies address with limited success. David Jacobs, chief scientist at the National Center for Healthy Housing, points out that there are known remedies for hazardous properties, and argues that landlords and insurers, who can grant or deny them coverage, must play a role in solving the problem. “We can’t afford to keep ignoring it — it costs too much and causes too much damage,” he said.Some states have limited or tried to ban insurance exclusions — a bill is pending in New York — but the insurance and real estate industries have opposed such measures. Executives in those businesses say that requiring lead coverage would collapse the insurance market and drive up the cost of housing, without addressing the presence of lead paint before a child is poisoned.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Efforts to resolve this longstanding problem should be focused on eliminating the lead paint risk from rental properties,” said Ken Stoller, a senior director at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, which represents insurers.While federal lawmakers have recently taken steps to combat lead poisoning, they have not done enough. Congress allocated money in the infrastructure bill to replace lead pipes that can taint water, but removed funding for the far larger problem of lead paint in older dwellings, which accounts for up to 70 percent of elevated lead in children, according to the C.D.C. Though President Biden’s Build Back Better bill contained $5 billion to remediate residential lead paint hazards, it stalled in Congress in December.And none of that legislation would help children like J.J. who have already been poisoned. His family filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the real estate company that owned their house, and are awaiting the outcome of a court dispute over whether the insurer’s lead exclusion was valid.Once a mellow child who was meeting all his milestones, J.J., now 5, exhibits typical effects of lead poisoning: aggression, attention problems and developmental delays. Even with therapy at preschool, he is considerably behind his 3-year-old sister in communicating: She talks in full sentences, but his words are halting, the meaning often only understood by his family.“I want to do whatever I can to get my baby extra help to help him have a better future,” Ms. Wiley said. “He is forever altered.”ImageSelena Wiley with her son J.J., who was exposed to lead paint in their rental home and treated for high levels of the toxic metal.  the repercussions of lead poisoning can be lifelong.Credit...Andrea Bruce for The New York TimesUnsafe and UninsuredA few years ago, Mr. Ryan, now a Democratic state senator, learned that his constituents in Buffalo were sending bottled water to Flint, Mich., where widespread lead contamination in the water supply had drawn national attention.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhile respecting the gesture to help, he recalled from a Reuters investigation that there were 17 ZIP codes in Buffalo where the rate of children with high lead levels was at least double that of Flint. In surrounding Erie County, more than 500 children 3 and under were newly confirmed to have elevated lead in 2020. The health department is now monitoring about 1,300 children overall, but there as elsewhere across the country, experts believe the true number of children affected is higher, as not all are screened for the toxic metal.In 2017, Mr. Ryan, then an assemblyman, introduced a bill to tackle what he saw as a major factor in the lead crisis: insurance exclusions. Not only did they prevent children from being compensated, they reduced landlords’ accountability. “Insurance is often part of the solution to keeping homes safe,” Mr. Ryan said.“Taxpayers are paying a great amount of money every year to treat victims of lead poisoning,” he added, “and that cost should be borne by the property owner and insurance company.”One New York family recently affected by an exclusion was that of Gabrielle Chaplin, whose 2-year-old daughter was found to have five times the threshold for elevated lead after a checkup in September 2020. (The Times is providing limited identifying information about the children in this article to protect their privacy.)ImageA nurse trying to comfort the daughter of Gabrielle Chaplin before she underwent a blood test for lead.Credit...Joshua Rashaad McFadden for The New York TimesMs. Chaplin, 31, who works in debt collections, knew to be wary of lead. As a girl in Buffalo, she had been poisoned herself and performed poorly in classes. “I used to skip school because I didn’t understand stuff,” she recalled.Ms. Chaplin wanted her daughter’s life to be different, so when looking at an apartment in an Erie County suburb, she said, she asked about lead paint and was assured there was none. But after her child was poisoned, an inspector found lead in the basement, front porch and exterior of the house, including along windows that Ms. Chaplin often opened and shut — which can chip paint and create lead dust — while at home during the pandemic.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn December, Ms. Chaplin learned that her landlord’s insurance policy had a lead exclusion. Her lawyer, Jonathan Staehr, said he would wait to see how the lead affected her daughter’s development before advising whether to sue the landlord.The girl, now 3, angers easily and has trouble calming herself down, her mother said. Once a week, she sees a tutor from a community-funded program for lead-poisoned children.“It’s heartbreaking because it was my baby’s health that was played with,” Ms. Chaplin said.Mr. Ryan’s attempts to address such cases have been stymied: His bill passed the Assembly twice but faced strong opposition from insurers and has stalled in the Senate’s insurance committee. Senator Neil Breslin, a Democrat and the panel’s chairman, said in an interview that he wanted insurers to provide proof that the bill would destabilize the market, as they claim it would. But he has not held a hearing.New York and other areas around the country with older housing have long had issues with lead poisoning. For decades, the metal was added to make paint more durable and resistant to moisture. The health risks have been known for centuries, but the United States did not ban lead paint for homes until 1978.Soon after, lawyers began suing landlords on behalf of poisoned children. “How much would someone have to pay you to take away 10 IQ points and fundamentally alter who you are?” asked Vincent Greene, a lawyer who has handled lead cases. By the early 1990s, insurers told state insurance commissions that they were facing crushing costs from lead paint verdicts and settlements that could reach into the millions, and sought to exclude lead coverage from their policies.Regulators appear to have offered little pushback. In 1993, a Department of Housing and Urban Development advisory group noted in a report that Aetna, an industry giant, had gotten approval in 40 states for the exclusions. The American Association of Insurance Services, which developed policy language for hundreds of insurers, had won approval in 32 states to exclude coverage for lead in paint, water and soil, the report said.By 1999, New York State approved exclusions for 90 companies, records show. They are now common with insurers big and small, and the state no longer keeps track.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe federal housing department estimates that significant lead paint hazards remain in about 29 million housing units, and that young children live in approximately 3.3 million of them. The problem spans the country, with persistent risk in cities including Baltimore, Detroit, Jackson, Miss., Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Sacramento. Minority children are especially affected, given that they are more likely to live in older rental homes that are poorly maintained by landlords.“We’ve allowed bad housing conditions to become normalized,” said Ruth Ann Norton, chief executive of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative. “Kids can overcome a lot of things, but brain damage isn’t one of them.”

      Insurers argue that banning exclusions now would drive up premiums and would not promote the best way to protect children — correcting lead hazards before residents are exposed, a task they say is better left to landlords and local housing or health regulators.“It’s like insuring a burning building that is already on fire,” said Ellen Melchionni, president of the New York Insurance Association, a trade group. “We don’t think forcing insurance companies to pay for a known hazard will be the solution.”Advocates for Mr. Ryan’s bill contend that insurers can incentivize landlords to take steps before a child is harmed, by requiring them to fix lead hazards before providing coverage.Ridding homes of lead paint can be costly — though grants and loans are available in many cities. Nonetheless, landlords can take less expensive measures to make houses “lead safe”: removing peeling paint and sealing surfaces with a new coat to prevent children from ingesting toxic flakes and dust, for example. Dr. Jacobs, who oversaw efforts to reduce lead hazards at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that given the millions of times remediation procedures had been used across the country, lead was no longer the liability it was three decades ago.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“It’s something you can get your arms around,” Dr. Jacobs said.ImageAn inspector found lead hazards at Ms. Chaplin’s former home in a suburb of Buffalo. Lead paint has been banned in the United States for decades.Credit...Joshua Rashaad McFadden for The New York TimesBut often, dangers are identified only after a child has shown symptoms of lead poisoning or been screened in a checkup.Preventive requirements vary considerably across the country, and some are more effective than others. In Maryland, for example, all properties built before 1978 must have a lead inspection certificate at each change of occupancy. In Rochester, N.Y., rentals must be inspected every three or six years, depending on the building’s size. Lead poisoning has dropped considerably in both areas. But such laws are relatively uncommon in the United States and unevenly enforced.A few states have restricted lead exclusions. New Hampshire has prohibited them since 2019. That has encouraged owners to fix up their properties, said D.J. Bettencourt, the state’s deputy insurance commissioner, because otherwise they may find themselves uninsured.In Rhode Island, insurers are required to cover owners who have proved their properties are safe through abatement or inspections. If hazards persist and the insurers decline to offer coverage, they must direct the owners to a state-sponsored program for high-risk candidates, though there is no requirement to actually purchase lead coverage through the state.There was no lead coverage for a duplex in Coventry, R.I., where Amie Jordan-Wade lived when her daughter was severely poisoned in 2015. (Neither the landlord nor the insurer would say why.) The baby was a little over a year old when her mother noticed that she would not respond when her name was called.“She was distant and dazed,” Mrs. Jordan-Wade said.Doctors discovered that the little girl’s lead level was extremely high and hospitalized her to begin chelation therapy, a process that removes heavy metals from the blood. An inspector found lead hazards throughout the three-bedroom rental — around windows, doors and baseboards, according to state records.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe girl’s mother sued the landlord, Butkus Properties. Her lawyer, Mr. Greene, eventually discovered that the insurer, Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Company, had a lead exclusion at the time.Mrs. Jordan-Wade, who works as a produce manager at a local grocery store, said her daughter, now 8, is happy but struggles with behavioral issues. Lead can also lead to tooth decay, and the girl has needed two dental surgeries. The family is on Medicaid, so the care is covered by the state.“I don’t know what her needs are going to be as she gets older,” Mrs. Jordan-Wade said. “It can take a long time to know the effects.”ImageA child was lead-poisoned while living at 2400 Barton Avenue in Richmond, Va.

The building was held by an L.L.C., Walker Row Partnership, and Mr. Stallings began divesting most of its assets. After Walker Row was sued in the lead case in 2017, it would pay only a pittance of what was owed.Janae Thompson, who brought the lawsuit, had moved with her daughter into Apartment 15 at the building in 2008. The Richmond property was a three-story brick building with stately columns; at about $650 a month, the rental seemed like a good find. Mrs. Thompson, then a 21-year-old single mother who went by her maiden name of Eddings at the time, was getting her associate degree while juggling a job at a bank; her child, Ziona, was about to turn 1.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySeveral months after moving in, Ziona started to regress. She cried a lot, often for no apparent reason. Her growing vocabulary stalled over the next year. She began to have trouble picking up her toys and no longer needed to be scolded for opening the refrigerator, as she seemed to have lost the strength to do so.In June 2009, after the girl had turned 2, she cried for nearly a day and a half straight, so Mrs. Thompson took her to the doctor. The next day, she was told to rush Ziona to a hospital. Her lead level was nearly six times what the C.D.C. now considers elevated. Afterward, an inspector found peeling paint in the living room and bedrooms and lead hazards on the doors and windows.Mrs. Thompson never brought Ziona back to Apartment 15. Over the next few years, the girl became aggressive and easily agitated, hitting herself and banging her head against the wall, her mother said. She was hyperactive with a short attention span and often in tears. Once in school, Ziona needed special help. For years, Mrs. Thompson paid for tutoring and behavioral therapy.Although much of Ziona’s medical care was covered by Medicaid, Mrs. Thompson said, “my life revolved around trying to find extra money” to try to “make sure she was OK.”A lawyer, Mr. Serpe, took Mrs. Thompson on as a client and worked for nearly a decade to try to hold Mr. Stallings and his company accountable. The case, like many others Mr. Serpe had handled, presented almost insurmountable challenges.In 2010, he sent a letter notifying Mr. Stallings of potential legal action, but said there was no response. Mr. Serpe filed a lawsuit in 2017 and eventually learned that Travelers Insurance, which covered the property, had a lead exclusion.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn 2018, after Mr. Stallings failed to show up in state court, a judge awarded Ziona $2 million in damages.ImageJanae Thompson with her daughter, Ziona. They won a lead lawsuit against their landlord’s L.L.C., but it paid only a small fraction of what was owed in the case.Credit...Andrea Bruce for The New York TimesMr. Stallings said in an interview that he had not been personally served the case, a claim Mr. Serpe disputed, noting that another company officer was given the complaint. The developer said he had been preoccupied running a local entertainment venue and had not realized there was a lead exclusion in his policy. “I didn’t pay any attention to it after I thought the insurance company would handle it,” he said. “Long story short, it slipped through the cracks.” He also said he had rented the property through the local housing authority, which was supposed to do an inspection.After the judgment, Mr. Stallings resisted paying the $2 million owed by his company. At an October 2018 hearing, he testified that for six years he had been shutting down Walker Row because it was not profitable. When asked in the hearing why his website listed several projects under development, Mr. Stallings said the site was old. Asked why it had been updated just months earlier, Mr. Stallings said he did not know.At the hearing, he mentioned four more L.L.C.s associated with his business. But Walker Row, he said, had no pending projects, no employees and no tenants paying rent.In the interview, Mr. Stallings expressed frustration about insurance exclusions and said he understood that Mrs. Thompson was trying to “come through the L.L.C.” and have him held liable for her daughter’s condition. “L.L.C.s are there to protect people from being personally sued,” he added. “Somebody a lot smarter than me started this.”Tax returns from 2016 show Walker Row had $2 million in assets and liabilities. That year, the building where Mrs. Thompson and Ziona had lived sold for nearly $900,000. By 2019, few assets remained in the L.L.C. Mr. Serpe said he believed that Mr. Stallings had executed a “tremendous corporate shell game” to avoid the full judgment — a claim Mr. Stallings denies, saying the divestments were unrelated to the lawsuit.Mrs. Thompson, worn down by the litigation, agreed to a settlement of $140,000. After court and legal fees, about $70,000 was put into a trust for Ziona.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNow 14, Ziona attends a small Christian school and is doing well academically, which her mother attributes to years of extra help and the individualized attention she still receives. The teenager is on the cheerleading and dance teams, too, but has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, can be impulsive and has significant trouble managing her emotions — conditions that are often associated with lead-poisoned children. She is timid and often afraid to be out in public, especially on her own.

It wasn’t until J.J. was diagnosed in November 2018 with lead poisoning that a health inspector scoured the house where he lived. The health department sent a letter ordering the property owner, HomeWorks Funding Group II L.L.C., to address the lead dangers in January 2019.An inspector had found lead paint and dust in two bedrooms and the stairway of the home. Months earlier, a maintenance worker had fixed several windows, scraping away paint that scattered across J.J.’s bedroom and other areas upstairs. In a lawsuit filed against HomeWorks, Ms. Wiley and her fiancé said the worker did not clean up the debris, so Ms. Wiley tried to do so herself. HomeWorks declined to comment.
      
    



  
  
  



























 








    
    





  
    
      The current condition of the home is a threat to public health because lead poisoning can cause permanent health problems in children, including brain damage, learning disabilities, behavioral problems and liver and kidney damage. In extreme cases, seizures and death can occur. This condition is a threat to the health of the children living at or visiting the residence.

    Letter from St. Joseph's County Department of Health to HomeWorks
  























By November, the family learned that J.J. was poisoned. Before they could move out, Ms. Wiley went into labor in December, delivering her daughter almost two months early. Soon after, HomeWorks showed them another rental home nearby; when Ms. Wiley insisted the county test it for lead, she learned that it had lead too. Her family moved out of state, where her fiancé works at a gas station as she cares for the children.ImageJ.J. was lead-poisoned  after a worker scraped away paint at his family’s rental home in South Bend, Ind.Credit...Andrea Bruce for The New York TimesAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMartin Gould, a lawyer for the family, eventually learned that HomeWorks’ insurance policy had a lead exclusion. But last month, J.J.’s family seemed to catch a break: A state judge ruled that the exclusion was unenforceable because the language was too broad — meaning the insurer, Indiana Farmers Mutual, might have to pay its policy limit of $1 million if the family wins or settles its lawsuit against HomeWorks.The judge’s decision, which is limited to J.J.’s case, was surprising: Lead exclusions are rarely thrown out. About two weeks ago, Farmers Mutual filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider the ruling, saying that he’d disregarded cases where similar lead exclusions had been found enforceable.Regardless of the insurance dispute, the family’s suit against the landlord has presented familiar challenges. Mr. Gould discovered at least eight L.L.C.s tied to HomeWorks, which advertised that it managed nearly 1,000 properties in Indiana and Michigan. But a lawyer for the company told him that only two of the L.L.C.s were associated with J.J.’s former home. One was the property management firm. The other was the company that had owned the house, which Mr. Gould found was sold to another L.L.C. after J.J. was poisoned; Mr. Gould suspects both have few assets.HomeWorks previously billed itself as a one-stop shop to rent, buy, sell and invest in real estate, he said, but changed its website after the lawsuit, making its entities seem unrelated.“You can’t have it both ways — be a big company when it benefits you to generate revenue and business, and then hide behind an L.L.C. when you are sued in an attempt to escape accountability,” Mr. Gould said.Ms. Wiley, in moments of sadness about her son, said she found herself wondering, “What would it have been like if they hadn’t been so negligent?” She added, “They took who I had away.”ImageJ.J. drawing with help from his father.

Ross, No. 21-468.Lawyers for the Humane Society of the United States and other animal welfare groups, which intervened in the case to defend the law, wrote that it was meant to end “cruel and unsanitary conditions that threaten the health of California consumers” and that “producers can freely sell products outside California from farm animals confined contrary to Proposition 12’s standards.”A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, rejected the argument that the law’s out-of-state effects made it invalid. “State laws that regulate only conduct in the state, including the sale of products in the state, do not have impermissible extraterritorial effects,” Judge Sandra S. Ikuta wrote for the panel.The law forbids the sale of most pork in California unless the pig it comes from was born to a sow that was housed with 24 square feet of space. But most sows around the nation are kept in much smaller enclosures.“These pens,” the groups challenging the California law wrote, “provide around 14 square feet of space and — for hygiene, safety, and animal-welfare and husbandry reasons — do not allow the sow to turn around.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe size of California’s market, the groups added, makes it impossible to ignore the state’s requirements. “Californians account for 13 percent of the nation’s pork consumption, but raise hardly any pigs,” their brief said. “The massive costs of complying with Proposition 12 fall almost exclusively on out-of-state farmers.”Since California imports almost all the pork sold in the state, they said, the law as a practical matter seeks to regulate producers in places like Minnesota and Iowa."

Translation software that provides deaf students with a more fluid and interactive experience. Data analysis to determine effective methods to identify those with dyslexia.These tools, which all incorporate artificial intelligence, aim to find better ways to detect, teach and assist those with learning disabilities. Some are already in classrooms; others are still in the research phase.Social robots, which are made to interact with humans, can help teach social and educational skills to students of all abilities, including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hearing impairments, Down syndrome and autism.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAddressing the needs of children on the autism spectrum is particularly urgent because of their sheer numbers — one in 54 children are diagnosed with autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.And those students tend to respond to robots “in a way that they don’t to puppets or pet therapies, or to many of the other kinds of things that we’ve tried,” said Brian Scassellati, a professor of computer science, cognitive science and mechanical engineering at Yale University.That may be because robots seem humanlike but are nonjudgmental, he said. The robots come in a variety of designs, including a small boy, a classic sci-fi machine and a furry snowman, and they go by peppy names such as Kaspar, Nao and Zeno.In a recent study by Professor Scassellati and his colleagues, an early prototype of a robot named Jibo — which looks like a small table lamp with a round head that swivels in all directions and a glowing white circle on a touch screen as its face — worked every day for 30 days with 12 children and their caregivers. Jibo modeled social-gaze behavior, such as making eye contact and sharing attention, and provided feedback and guidance during six interactive games played on screens.“The robot’s job was to adjust the difficulty of the game based on the child’s performance,” Professor Scassellati said. But the idea isn’t that the robot replaces a teacher or caregiver. “We never want to encourage kids to just respond to the technology — that doesn’t do them any good,” he said. “We want to enable them to interact with people in a more substantial way.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyResearch has found that the robots help improve educational and social skills, but far more studies are needed to discover how to make these changes stick and translate to the real world.How does A.I. play into this? Technology has advanced, but so has research into how perceptions are formed, how people can infer each other’s feelings and thoughts and what constitutes emotional intelligence. These insights can be translated into algorithms that allow robots to interpret speech, gestures and complex verbal and nonverbal cues as well as learn from feedback.Danielle Kovach, who teaches third-grade special education in Hopatcong, N.J., said she would be curious to see what further research shows. “So much of teaching social skills to students with autism is reading facial expressions, reading body languages and picking up on social cues of others. Is a robot able to mimic those things we learn from humans?” she said. Dr. Kovach is also the president of the Council for Exceptional Children, an organization of special-education professionals.While the social robots are primarily used in research studies, there is a nascent marketplace aimed at classrooms and individuals. For example, LuxAI, a Luxembourg-based company, has been selling the friendly-looking QTRobot, designed for children with autism, to parents since early 2021; right now it operates only in English and French.Children with autism interact with the robot daily for 10 minutes to an hour, depending on their age and level of support needed, Aida Nazari, a co-founder of LuxAI, said. The company has sold a few hundred QTRobots, primarily to families in the United States, she added. But many families may find that a social robot is far too expensive at this point: QTRobot costs $2,000 plus a $129 monthly software subscription, which includes support services.Rachel Ricci was the first person in Canada to order a QTRobot, receiving it in February 2021. Her son, Caden, 10, was diagnosed with autism when he was 3 years old. Caden and his parents or therapist use tablets to play games aimed at enhancing his educational social skills, such as recognizing and naming emotions. QTRobot serves as an encouraging third friend and teacher.He uses it for 30 minutes five days a week, and “QT helps him build his confidence,” Ms. Ricci said. Getting the robot during the pandemic was a lifesaver, she added: While most of his classmates at a Montreal school for those with autism regressed when school closed and therapists were unavailable, Caden stayed on track. Ms. Ricci credits QTRobot with that.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut others say there’s a big difference between one-on-one use of a robot in a private home and use in a school setting.While such technology can be “seductive,” it is “rarely used completely as intended in the classroom,” said Jordan Adcock, who teaches fifth grade in Forest Grove, Ore., and has a son with autism. “What we really need are more teachers, aides and a high-quality curriculum.”A.I. is also used in a simpler way to help those living with autism: through gaming. Maithilee Kunda, an assistant professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University, and her colleagues created a video game called “Film Detective,” which will be piloted this spring.The concept: The player wakes up in the future — the year 3021 — and has to help a scientist and her robot sidekick catch a villain who is stealing items from the Museum of Human History. Their detective work involves using a series of film clips to decode how people in today’s world behave.“Many with autism have superior visual thinking but have a lot of difficulty with social action,” Professor Kunda said. “So, we thought, what if we can give them visual ways to imagine theory of mind?” Theory of mind is the ability to imagine what other people are thinking or feeling — something those with autism can find particularly difficult, which may make social interactions challenging.The game taps into theory of mind by using movie clips, asking players to interpret why characters acted the way they did and what they might have been thinking.Without A.I., “it would have been possible to make the game and watch the movies together, but the unique thing we’re providing is a very detailed and explicit theory of how social reasoning works that can be simulated. We can use it as scaffolding to help teach kids,” said Professor Kunda, who also directs Vanderbilt’s Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Visual Analogical Systems and is a researcher at Vanderbilt’s Frist Center for Autism and Innovation.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe use of A.I. to improve visual and auditory accessibility is also evolving quickly.For example, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, one of the nine colleges of the Rochester Institute of Technology, worked with Microsoft to customize technology and platforms that already existed in order to caption classes for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The classes have sign-language translators and stenographers, but more assistance was needed.For the institute’s purposes, Microsoft Translator was “taught” specialized terminology used in classes as well as vocabulary specific to the university, such as the names of certain buildings and people, said Wendy Dannels, a member of the research faculty who is deaf.With A.I., the speech-to-written-word translation is far more fluent than automatic speech recognition used to be, she said. And spurred by the pandemic, during which face coverings made communication particularly difficult for many deaf and hard-of-hearing people, the institute developed an app called TigerChat. The app turns speech into text messages, making it easier to chat with friends.In addition, faculty members at the institute are working with Vuzix, a company that has developed eyeglasses that can display text directly on the lenses. Roshan Mathew, a graduate student in computer-human interaction at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has tried the Vuzix glasses and loves them. “When I have to use a smartphone or laptop when talking to someone, I can’t maintain face-to-face contact,” Mr. Mathew, who is deaf, said. “Communications are not just what we say, but what we see.”A key use of A.I. in special education is its ability to detect patterns in large amounts of data to better identify and define certain disabilities.Take dyslexia, for example. Those with the condition typically have reading difficulties because they have trouble connecting the letters and words on the page to the corresponding sounds they represent. As of 2020, 47 states required that students be screened for dyslexia in early elementary education. Yet there is no tool designed specifically for this, and dyslexia is often misdiagnosed — or missed completely.The most widely used assessment for dyslexia is a test called DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills), typically given to all students in kindergarten through third grade to assess their overall reading and literacy, said Patrick Kennedy, a senior research associate at the University of Oregon’s Center on Teaching & Learning. The test was not designed to detect dyslexia but is used “in the dearth of other tools,” Dr. Kennedy said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDr. Kennedy and his colleagues plan to recruit 48 elementary schools in the United States and have 4,800 students in kindergarten through third grade take the DIBELS assessment.Over the next three years, they will examine the outcomes — using machine learning — to determine patterns in the development of reading and spelling over time. Ultimately, the researchers hope to evaluate if DIBELS successfully identifies dyslexia and how it can be used most effectively.“The purpose of this project is to provide schools with better information to allow them to make better decisions,” Dr. Kennedy said."

Peters","You won’t find Red Pill News or the X22 Report on YouTube anymore. The far-right online shows were taken down in the fall of 2020 after the major social media and tech companies started purging accounts that spread the QAnon conspiracy theory.But you will find both of them on a video-sharing platform called Rumble, where their content ranks among the most popular on the site.Over the last week, as Republicans opened a misleading attack on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as too lenient with criminals who sexually abuse children, Red Pill News and the X22 Report posted videos claiming that her nomination to the Supreme Court by President Biden was all the proof anyone needed that a cabal of pedophiles operated at the highest levels of the government, a belief QAnon adherents hold.“Think about the bigger picture,” the host of the X22 Report, which has more than half a million Rumble subscribers, implored his viewers in an episode posted on Wednesday. “Right now, people are being taught about pedophilia. People are listening to this, and they’re seeing exactly how these people think and how they’re trying to normalize it.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn one day, that episode was viewed almost 220,000 times on Rumble, which has experienced explosive growth since conservatives and supporters of former President Donald J. Trump embraced it after the 2020 election. Its users and financial backers see it as the new frontier in social media — a network built by and for them, where virtually anything goes.Rumble’s chief executive pitches the company, which is based in Toronto, as “immune from cancel culture.” It has tens of millions of dollars in financing from right-of-center entrepreneurs like the billionaire Peter Thiel, and Mr. Trump entered into an arrangement for Rumble to provide his new social media service, Truth Social, with the technology and operational support that it lacked itself.Once better known for viral videos of cats and toddlers, Rumble now draws 44 million monthly visitors, according to the analytics firm Similarweb, giving it a larger reach than other top destinations for conservative content, including Breitbart, Newsmax and The Daily Wire. In the first nine months of last year, the most recently available financial information, Rumble generated more than $6.5 million in revenue, most of it from advertising, but was not profitable. It has announced plans to trade publicly, as soon as the middle of this year, after merging with a special purpose acquisition company.Daily business updates  The latest coverage of business, markets and the economy, sent by email each weekday.  Get it sent to your inbox.The story of Rumble’s success is instructive for both sides of the tense debate over balancing the right to free speech with the growing threat that disinformation poses to the stability of governments around the globe. For those who argue that Google and Facebook algorithms are blunt, deeply flawed instruments for policing discourse, Rumble offers a welcome alternative, albeit an imperfect one. And for those who fear that lawmakers and technology companies aren’t doing enough to tame false and fabricated information ahead of the next presidential election, Rumble has opened up a potentially dangerous loophole.“There is something very significant about Rumble that I don’t think people appreciate,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, the liberal media watchdog. Mr. Carusone said the painstaking work that went into persuading Facebook, Google and Twitter to be more aggressive about policing fake and inciting content prevented a lot of it from breaking through to a wider audience.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Rumble basically changes that game,” he added.Rumble’s chief executive, Chris Pavlovski, has said he did not set out to create a platform where right-wing content is favored when he started it in 2013. Rather, he said, he envisioned Rumble as an alternative to the approach that Google and other large tech companies took a decade ago when they began to promote the content of a select group of influencers over everyday users.“There is no ideology here. If anything, we’re just neutral,” Mr. Pavlovski said in an interview last month with a popular Rumble content creator.He has described his mission in lofty, virtuous terms. “We are a movement that does not stifle, censor or punish creativity,” he said in announcing Rumble’s plans to go public. More recently, he has chastised social media and search engine companies like DuckDuckGo, a Google alternative popular on the right that angered some users when it said it would steer people away from sites that promoted misinformation about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Pavlovski announced on Twitter that he had deleted its app from his phone.But Rumble’s democratizing vision for speech online has so far mostly appealed to people on the right. That includes numerous extremists who use their Rumble accounts to deny the effectiveness of vaccines, play down the horrific human toll of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and question the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Still, criticism of the often capricious and inconsistent nature of online censorship rings true beyond those with fringe beliefs.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 11:15 a.m. ET1 hour ago1 hour agoAs sanctions bite, a French sporting goods giant suspends Russian operations.More workers quit in February as job openings stayed high.Condé Nast workers form a companywide union.There is a large audience to be had, and one that some who study far-right content online warn has been left unchecked to grow into a powerful political weapon for conservatives and supporters of Mr. Trump.ImageA screenshot of the Rumble app displaying the account for Dan Bongino, the pro-Trump host who streams his daily show on the platform to 2.2 million subscribers.“It’s already succeeded — this alternate universe has already bloomed,” said Denver Riggleman, a former Republican congressman and an intelligence analyst who is working with the commission in Congress investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Pavlovski and Rumble representatives did not respond to interview requests.But he has made clear in streamed remarks to Rumble creators and to others that his ambitions are far greater than increasing traffic to his website and app. With investments from like-minded critics of Big Tech like Mr. Thiel, Mr. Pavlovski has described a vision for building a “new internet” — a kind of alt-web that is entirely distinct from the dominant players in the industry.Rumble has already built out its own cloud service infrastructure and video streaming capacity, offering it and its partners greater independence from the Amazons and Microsofts of the internet — and the assurance that they can’t be shut down if one of those providers decides to pull the plug over objectionable content. Looming large in the minds of Rumble fans is the experience of the social media network Parler, which effectively shut down once Amazon said it would no longer host the site on its computing services after the Jan. 6 attacks last year.The promise of independence from the tech giants led Mr. Trump to have Rumble provide technology and cloud services for Truth Social, which has struggled to become fully operational on its own. In a statement announcing the partnership in December, Mr. Trump said he had picked Rumble because it’s among the service providers “who do not discriminate against political ideology.”Rumble has also secured exclusive arrangements with popular content creators who have a following beyond conservatives and Trump supporters, such as the journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has been vocal about his beliefs that technology behemoths and the mainstream media have too much power to quash speech. Rumble highlighted its partnership with Mr. Greenwald as an example of its content-neutral approach. (As for what it considers out of bounds, Rumble says it does not tolerate anything that is overtly racist, promotes violence or breaks the law.)But there are also the popular Rumble creators the company doesn’t talk about in news releases, like Alex Jones of Infowars, who was barred from YouTube and other mainstream platforms in 2018 and now has more than 100,000 Rumble followers.That’s a small number compared with the millions on YouTube who followed Mr. Jones, who has spread bogus theories that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was staged as part of a government plot to confiscate firearms. Those who study the right-wing media ecosystem say it is difficult to tell how large the overall audience for hard-right content is, in large part because the traffic data available for individual sites includes a lot of overlap from users who frequent more than one.“It’s an intensely engaged population,” said Yochai Benkler, a professor at Harvard Law School who is a co-author of a book about the ways conservative outlets reinforce their messages through repetition and shut down dissent.

Mr. Bongino’s path to Rumble illustrates the inherent difficulties of policing misinformation and conspiracy theories. YouTube started cracking down on him in the fall of 2020 for violating its policies meant to stop the spread of false stories about the coronavirus.After YouTube prevented Mr. Bongino from collecting ad revenue from the site, he announced that he was taking an equity stake in Rumble and made it his preferred video platform. “We need a home,” he said at the time. “We need somewhere to go where conservative views won’t be discriminated against.”In the weeks and months that followed, as Mr. Trump refused to accept his loss in the election and YouTube blocked content that bolstered his false claims of widespread voter fraud, others jumped on board with Rumble, too, including One America News.On the day after Rumble announced its OAN partnership, Mr. Pavlovski insisted that his company would never censor that kind of political speech. “Rumble will not adopt a policy like this,” he said, citing an unimpeachable inspiration for his resolve: Galileo, who was charged with heresy by the Roman Catholic Church for theorizing that the Earth revolved around the sun."

But over the past decade, hangar space has become sparse, so Mr. Pellitteri, a general contractor, has joined an increasing number of developers who have never worked in aviation before: He’s building hangars himself.Private air travel skyrocketed in the pandemic as more travelers, eager to avoid sitting next to a potentially sick passenger or spending a long flight wearing a mask, have made the switch from commercial to charter.Business jet takeoffs and landings were up as much as 40 percent in 2021 from the year before, according to some estimates, and the business aviation tracker WingX reported that 2021 was the busiest year on record for global business jet activity.But as more private planes have filled the sky, the crunch — which was apparent in 2019 — has created gridlock over parking on the ground.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Pellitteri, a resident of Seattle, said he had entered the hangar business after being frustrated by the inability to find a spot to park his plane when he shuttled to his second home in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho.By the end of 2023, he plans to have completed four new hangars at Pappy Boyington Field in Coeur d’Alene: two for smaller jets and two for midsize aircraft like the Gulfstream 280. He plans to sell the smaller ones for around $1.5 million, but said the price could increase because rising costs of steel and labor have already pushed him well over budget.It’s not just Coeur d’Alene, Mr. Pellitteri said; there are no hangars available at Paine Field near Seattle, either. “Every year it’s gotten busier,” he said. “You go to Paine Field now, there’s more airplanes than there’s places to park.”Daily business updates  The latest coverage of business, markets and the economy, sent by email each weekday.  Get it sent to your inbox.The United States has more airports — more than 20,000 — than any country in the world, and local municipalities own the vast majority of them. When it comes to creating more hangar space for private jets, however, developers work with companies called fixed-base operators, which function much like marinas do for shipyards by providing all of the necessary services for flying. Developers often negotiate long-term leases with the operators and build hangar space on that land.One of those developers is Tal Keinan, an American-Israeli investor and former fighter pilot who is developing a network of luxury hangars. It’s also his first foray into the aviation world — his company, Sky Harbour, opened its first locations in Houston and Nashville in 2021, with sites in Denver, Miami and Phoenix scheduled to open next. The hangars include adjoining offices and kitchens, as well as line services such as handling, fueling, cleaning and detailing.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“There’s a deficit of hangars — it’s chronic,” Mr. Keinan said. Part of the reason may be optics: Most airports are publicly run, he said, and “it’s not a very good political use of capital to build hangars for business jets on your airport.”Sky Harbour’s luxury, full-service model is new but not unique; other businesses like CloudNine Hangars, which is building four full-service hangars at the Camarillo Airport in California, are also offering hangars that blend aircraft parking and offices into one sleek space.But there’s another issue at play, too, said Katrin Gist, who leads aviation properties for CBRE, a commercial real estate service firm. At many airports near major city centers, there simply is no more land left to lease.“Even before Covid, we were on an upward economic cycle, and hangars were already pretty in demand,” she said, adding that interest in private planes grew among passengers and buyers during the pandemic. “Those two factors have created the perfect storm for hangar demand nationwide.”Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 7:38 a.m. ET5 hours ago5 hours agoAs CNN+ debuts new show, Chris Wallace talks about leaving Fox News.Business travel may never fully recover, as companies like McKinsey make permanent cuts to trips.FedEx’s founder, Fred Smith, will step down as C.E.O.But with airport hangars, the overriding rule of commercial real estate applies: Location is king. A hangar at an airport near a busy city center is much more in demand, and much harder to come by, than one farther flung.ImageKimberly Herrell, owner and chief executive of Schubach Aviation.Credit...Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times“The majority of private jets want to be at certain airports, and those are the ones that are the most crowded,” Ms. Gist said. “If you go to more tertiary airports in other parts of the country, you’ll still find some hangar space available.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn the past year, Ms. Gist has represented a real estate deal for a 63,000-square-foot hangar facility at Burbank Airport, just outside Los Angeles; an 18,000-square-foot hangar facility at Paine Field; and a development of 27 hangars at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif. She would not disclose cost but estimated that values had increased as much as 30 to 50 percent since the beginning of the pandemic.Indeed, aircraft owners are finding that hangar rents have climbed so much that the cost to park at an airport farther from the city center and then chartering a helicopter in can be cheaper than leasing hangar space at their airport of choice.Roger Woolsey has a bird’s-eye view of the hangar-space crunch. He is chief executive of Million Air, which franchises 37 fixed-base operators across Canada, Colombia and the United States. About one-third of its franchises are actively seeking additional hangar space, which Mr. Woolsey credits to the run on private jet inventory since 2020.“Prepandemic, roughly 12 percent of the used aircraft inventory in the world was for sale,” Mr. Woolsey said. “Today, it’s less than 4 percent.”Kimberly Herrell, owner and chief executive of the jet charter operator Schubach Aviation, has a 30,000-square-foot hangar in Carlsbad, Calif., and was able to secure a secondary hangar space at Carlsbad Jet Center last year. As demand has grown for her services, she has not struggled to find places to park her client’s planes, but she has had issues securing new aircraft.“Every jet for sale in the U.S. has been purchased,” she said. “It’s just nuts. We’re now sourcing planes from all over the world and trying to bring them in.”The jump in growth for private air travel has happened so quickly, Ms. Herrell said, that there simply hasn’t been time for the industry to expand in tandem.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Hangars require such a long process for building and approvals, especially on airport land,” she said. “It’s not shocking that it’s lagging behind.”ImagePlanes parked outside at McClellan–Palomar Airport in Carlsbad.Credit...Ariana Drehsler for The New York TimesEven developers who work with automobiles are getting in the mix. Next door to Sky Harbour’s facility in Miami is the Concours Club, a members-only racing retreat for owners of luxury vehicles that opened in June. But nearly 75 percent of Concours Club members use private planes to fly in to Miami, so Ronald Vogel, a founding member, is developing 300,000 feet of hangar space for his guests on 25 acres of adjacent land.“I saw the need,” Mr. Vogel said. “Back in 2018, I was flying in and out of there, and there was no hangar availability. There just wasn’t any land.”He added that the deal was his first commercial real estate project. “This was an interesting pivot for me,” he said.The rush to build hangars is a symptom of a greater shift in American aviation, said Doug Wilson, president and senior partner of FBO Partners, which offers consultancy services across the country. He likens the boom to those after World War II and in the late 1970s, when money also poured into the aviation business from the private sector.“There have been two great waves in general aviation, and so much wealth was created during Covid that we may be starting to see the beginnings of a third shift,” he said. “The private sector is going absolutely gangbusters building hangars as quickly as possible.”"

Some industry observers question the methodology.By Scott Reyburn","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/arts/design/art-basel-ubs-report-2022.html","Art Market Grew 29% in 2021, Says Key Report (Though Some Doubt It)","null","null","LONDON — International art sales “recovered strongly” after a pandemic-blighted year, according to the latest annual Art Basel & UBS Global Art Market Report, published on Tuesday. Sales reached an estimated $65.1 billion, up 29 percent on the previous year, the report says — but that headline figure, combining auction and gallery sales, remains short of the trade’s estimated $68.2 billion peak in 2014.“The market showed great resilience under continuing uncertainty in 2021,” wrote Clare McAndrew, a Dublin-based cultural economist, in the sixth edition of the report, published Tuesday by the world’s largest art fair franchise and its main corporate partner. She added that the market was “buoyed by robust growth, particularly in the auction sector, where secondary market sales of high-end works of art provided a significant uplift in value.”The Art Basel & UBS report is regarded as the most authoritative annual study of the global art market, and its findings are routinely cited in the news media. It is the only comprehensive survey of the international art trade that incorporates both values for public auctions and estimates for confidential dealer sales. The figures for dealers are based on self-reported survey responses from galleries, many of whom also exhibit at Art Basel fairs.According to the 279-page report, aggregate dealer sales rose to an estimated $34.7 billion in 2021, 18 percent up on a crisis-hit 2020, but still below the level of 2019. ​​“The highest rise in values year-on-year was in the segment of dealers with sales of between $5 million and $10 million,” the report says. “The smallest gains were experienced by dealers with turnover of less than $250,000.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAuction sales also advanced in 2021, according to the report, reaching $26.3 billion, 47 percent up on the previous year and exceeding sales in 2019. Auction houses’ private sales in 2021 contributed a further $4.1 billion, the report says.Online-only auctions were key to that recovery: So, too, was the major auction houses’ successful use of livestreaming for their marquee sales. Although not new, the hybrid online/live format had “substantially improved in terms of the quality of production and technical efficiency,” according to the report.China (including Hong Kong) remained the biggest market for public auctions, with 33 percent of the market, slightly ahead of the United States at 32 percent, followed by Britain at 13 percent (down from 18 percent in 2019). France made a notable upward move: Benefiting from the fallout of Brexit, auctions there increased by more than 60 percent to $2.2 billion, raising the country’s global market share to 9 percent.Given that online and hybrid auction sales were surging throughout 2021, while international art fairs only returned to in-person formats during the second half of the year, some seasoned art world observers were perplexed that Art Basel & UBS reported that dealer sales exceeded auctions.“I don’t believe the turnover of the dealers was bigger,” said the Belgian collector Alain Servais, a regular buyer of contemporary art at both fairs and auctions. Servais is a longstanding critic of what he regards as the Art Basel & UBS report’s “finger in the wind” methodology for calculating dealer sales. This year it was based on 774 survey responses, mostly from Europe. Galleries with turnover of more than $1 million a year supplied 37 percent of the responses.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The dealers’ survey is overweighted to the larger galleries,” said Servais in an interview. “They like the output of the report, because it gives a rosy view of the art world,” he added.In an interview, McAndrew, the report’s author, conceded that, “More would be better, but it does capture an important chunk of the market,” adding, “I’m optimistic in the future that there will be better ways to measure things.”McAndrew said her report was focused on the “traditional infrastructure” of the art trade, though there was a “huge universe of transacting” outside those structures, with NFT platforms producing “jaw-dropping” figures. Sales of art-related NFTs increased over a hundredfold year-on-year, reaching $2.6 billion. Sales of NFT collectibles grew to $8.6 billion, says the report, using data supplied by NonFungible.com.NFTs entered the traditional art market’s auction sector in 2021, but at “limited values thus far,” the report says: Christie’s raised $150 million; Sotheby’s sales reached $80 million.As the report was completed before Feb. 24, it does not address the war in Ukraine and its possible effect on the art market in 2022.“We’re maybe facing a recession that’s very different from the corona crisis,” said, Marta Gnyp, an art adviser and writer, based in Berlin.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyShe also pointed out the relatively small sample of dealer data on which the Art Basel & UBS report bases its findings. “It’s all guesses and estimates,” said Gnyp in an interview. “But, since the same limited data have been used over the years, it gives us an idea of the direction. It’s good to have it.”"

There are billions set aside to invest in police departments and the military, paid for in part by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy.For Congress, the release of the budget, a largely symbolic document, is seen as little more than a suggestion from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Still, it is an important accounting of the administration’s priorities, most notably that Biden appears to be focusing on smaller policy specifics instead of on the sweeping changes in his Build Back Better bill, which he has spent much of his time in office promoting but which was relegated to a footnote in the budget document.If you don’t have time to comb through all 149 pages, here’s what you need to know about the budget:Spending: The budget would bolster domestic spending by 7 percent from current levels, to roughly $1.6 trillion.Taxes: It proposes raising tax rates for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, including a “Billionaire Minimum Income Tax,” which add up to a $2.5 trillion tax increase over a decade. And as DealBook reported, it also urges new restrictions on stock buybacks.Defense: The administration asks for $773 billion in military spending, a nearly 10 percent increase and a reflection of threats like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Cybersecurity is also a major security concern reflected in the budget.Infrastructure: It calls for broad increases in funding for the Transportation Department to modernize roads, bridges, ports and public transit systems. The budget includes about $115 billion in funding that was part of the infrastructure bill passed by Congress last year.Climate: It seeks $45 billion to address climate change — an increase of nearly $17 billion from the year before — for the five major agencies tasked with addressing environmental risks. The president also proposed $11 billion to help other countries hit hard by global warming.Health: The administration asks for a major increase for the F.D.A.’s budget to prepare for another pandemic. The agency’s budget would rise by a third, to $8.4 billion.Much, much more: There’s also a 21-percent increase in funding for education, new low-income housing vouchers, an 18-percent rise in spending on diplomatic programs, and a plan to modernize I.R.S. rules, including for crypto tax reporting.Congressional responses to the budget largely fell along party lines. Democrats praised the emphasis on reducing the budget deficit. Republicans scoffed at proposed tax increases and warned that the proposals would do little to tame inflation. The president said his budget served a “bipartisan unity agenda.” And so begins another round of the arduous process of funding the government, which has become so fraught that the current fiscal year’s budget was approved only this month, too late to include as a basis for comparison for yesterday’s proposal for the next fiscal year.HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING FedEx’s founder is stepping down as C.E.O.

But the Finnish company didn’t mention what it was leaving behind: equipment and software connecting the government’s most powerful tool for digital surveillance to the nation’s largest telecommunications network.The tool was used to track supporters of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny. Investigators said it had intercepted the phone calls of a Kremlin foe who was later assassinated. Called the System for Operative Investigative Activities, or SORM, it is also most likely being employed at this moment as President Vladimir V. Putin culls and silences antiwar voices inside Russia.For more than five years, Nokia provided equipment and services to link SORM to Russia’s largest telecom service provider, MTS, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times. While Nokia does not make the tech that intercepts communications, the documents lay out how it worked with state-linked Russian companies to plan, streamline and troubleshoot the SORM system’s connection to the MTS network. Russia’s main intelligence service, the F.S.B., uses SORM to listen in on phone conversations, intercept emails and text messages, and track other internet communications.ImageThe documents outlined Nokia’s involvement in connecting the MTS network to SORM. Floor plans and schematics refer to SORM by its Russian acronym COPM.Credit...The New York TimesThe documents, spanning 2008 to 2017, show in previously unreported detail that Nokia knew it was enabling a Russian surveillance system. The work was essential for Nokia to do business in Russia, where it had become a top supplier of equipment and services to various telecommunications customers to help their networks function. The business yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue, even as Mr. Putin became more belligerent abroad and more controlling at home.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFor years, multinational companies capitalized on surging Russian demand for new technologies. Now global outrage over the largest war on European soil since World War II is forcing them to re-examine their roles.The conflict in Ukraine has upended the idea that products and services are agnostic. In the past, tech companies argued it was better to remain in authoritarian markets, even if that meant complying with laws written by autocrats. Facebook, Google and Twitter have struggled to find a balance when pressured to censor, be it in Vietnam or in Russia, while Apple works with a state-owned partner to store customer data in China that the authorities can access. Intel and Nvidia sell chips through resellers in China, allowing the authorities to buy them for computers powering surveillance.The lessons that companies draw from what’s happening in Russia could have consequences in other authoritarian countries where advanced technologies are sold. A rule giving the U.S. Commerce Department the power to block companies, including telecom equipment suppliers, from selling technology in such places was part of a bill, called the America Competes Act, passed by the House of Representatives in February.“We should treat sophisticated surveillance technology in the same way we treat sophisticated missile or drone technology,” said Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who was an assistant secretary of state for human rights in the Obama administration. “We need appropriate controls on the proliferation of this stuff just as we do on other sensitive national security items.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAndrei Soldatov, an expert on Russian intelligence and digital surveillance who reviewed some of the Nokia documents at the request of The Times, said that without the company’s involvement in SORM, “it would have been impossible to make such a system.”“They had to have known how their devices would be used,” said Mr. Soldatov, who is now a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.ImageA network diagram showing how data travels from Nokia equipment on the right, to SORM on the left.Credit...The New York TimesNokia, which did not dispute the authenticity of the documents, said that under Russian law, it was required to make products that would allow a Russian telecom operator to connect to the SORM system. Other countries make similar demands, the company said, and it must decide between helping make the internet work or leaving altogether. Nokia also said that it did not manufacture, install or service SORM equipment.The company said it follows international standards, used by many suppliers of core network equipment, that cover government surveillance. It called on governments to set clearer export rules about where technology could be sold and said it “unequivocally condemns” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“Nokia does not have an ability to control, access or interfere with any lawful intercept capability in the networks which our customers own and operate,” it said in a statement.MTS did not respond to requests for comment.The documents that The Times reviewed were part of almost two terabytes of internal Nokia emails, network schematics, contracts, license agreements and photos. The cybersecurity firm UpGuard and TechCrunch, a news website, previously reported on some of the documents linking Nokia to the state surveillance system. Following those reports, Nokia played down the extent of its involvement.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut The Times obtained a larger cache showing Nokia’s depth of knowledge about the program. The documents include correspondence on Nokia’s sending engineers to examine SORM, details of the company’s work at more than a dozen Russian sites, photos of the MTS network linked to SORM, floor plans of network centers and installation instructions from a Russian firm that made the surveillance equipment.After 2017, which is when the documents end, Nokia continued to work with MTS and other Russian telecoms, according to public announcements.SORM, which dates to at least the 1990s, is akin to the systems used by law enforcement around the world to wiretap and surveil criminal targets. Telecom equipment makers like Nokia are often required to ensure that such systems, known as lawful intercept, function smoothly within communications networks.In democracies, the police are generally required to obtain a court order before seeking data from telecom service providers. In Russia, the SORM system sidesteps that process, working like a surveillance black box that can take whatever data the F.S.B. wants without any oversight.In 2018, Russia strengthened a law to require internet and telecom companies to disclose communications data to the authorities even without a court order. The authorities also mandated that companies store phone conversations, text messages and electronic correspondence for up to six months, and internet traffic history for 30 days. SORM works in parallel with a separate censorship system that Russia has developed to block access to websites.Civil society groups, lawyers and activists have criticized the Russian government for using SORM to spy on Mr. Putin’s rivals and critics. The system, they said, is almost certainly being used now to crack down on dissent against the war. This month, Mr. Putin vowed to remove pro-Western Russians, whom he called “scum and traitors,” from society, and his government has cut off foreign internet services like Facebook and Instagram.ImageA Nokia store in Moscow in 2011.

It now makes the bulk of its $24 billion in annual sales providing telecom equipment and services so phone networks can function. Roughly $480 million of Nokia’s annual sales come from Russia and Ukraine, or less than 2 percent of its overall revenue, according to the market research firm Dell’Oro.Last decade, the Kremlin had grown serious about cyberspying, and telecom equipment providers were legally required to provide a gateway for spying. If Nokia did not comply, competitors such as the Chinese telecom giant Huawei were assumed to be willing to do so.By 2012, Nokia was providing hardware and services to the MTS network, according to the documents. Project documentation signed by Nokia personnel included a schematic of the network that depicted how data and phone traffic should flow to SORM. Annotated photos showed a cable labeled SORM plugging into networking equipment, apparently documenting work by Nokia engineers.ImageAn annotated photo appearing to show a cable connecting networking equipment to SORM.Credit...The New York TimesFlow charts showed how data would be transmitted to Moscow and F.S.B. field offices across Russia, where agents could use a computer system to search people’s communications without their knowledge.Specifics of how the program is used have largely been kept secret. “You will never know that surveillance was carried out at all,” said Sarkis Darbinyan, a Russian lawyer who co-founded Roskomsvoboda, a digital rights group.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. Russia said that it would sharply “reduce military activity” near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. The announcement was the first sign of progress to emerge from peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.Biden’s comments. During a speech in Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said that President Vladimir V. Putin “cannot remain in power,” sending U.S. officials scrambling to walk back the ad-lib. On Monday, Mr. Biden stood by his remark, but said it was a personal expression of his “moral outrage.”But some information about SORM has leaked out from court cases, civil society groups and journalists.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn 2011, embarrassing phone calls made by the Russian opposition leader Boris Y. Nemtsov were leaked to the media. Mr. Soldatov, who covered the incident as an investigative reporter, said the phone recordings had come from SORM surveillance. Mr. Nemtsov was murdered near the Kremlin in 2015.In 2013, a court case involving Mr. Navalny included details about his communications that were believed to have been intercepted by SORM. In 2018, some communications by Mr. Navalny’s supporters were tracked by SORM, said Damir Gainutdinov, a Russian lawyer who represented the activists. He said phone numbers, email addresses and internet protocol addresses had been merged with information that the authorities collected from VK, Russia’s largest social network, which is also required to provide access to user data through SORM.ImageSupporters of the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, shown during a hearing in Moscow last year, were tracked by SORM, a lawyer who represented them said. Credit...The New York Times“These tools are used not just to prosecute somebody but to fill out a dossier and collect data about somebody’s activities, about their friends, partners and so on,” said Mr. Gainutdinov, who now lives in Bulgaria. “Officers of the federal security service, due to the design of this system, have unlimited access to all communication.”By 2015, SORM was attracting international attention. That year, the European Court of Human Rights called the program a “system of secret surveillance” that was deployed arbitrarily without sufficient protection against abuse. The court ultimately ruled, in a case brought by a Russian journalist, that the tools violated European human rights laws.In 2016, MTS tapped Nokia to help upgrade its network across large swaths of Russia. MTS set out an ambitious plan to install new hardware and software between June 2016 and March 2017, according to one document.Nokia performed SORM-related work at facilities in at least 12 cities in Russia, according to the documents, which show how the network linked the surveillance system. In February 2017, a Nokia employee was sent to three cities south of Moscow to examine SORM, according to letters from a Nokia executive informing MTS employees of the trip.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNokia worked with Malvin, a Russian firm that manufactured the SORM hardware the F.S.B. used. One Malvin document instructed Malvin’s partners to ensure that they had entered the correct parameters for operating SORM on switching hardware. It also reminded them to notify Malvin technicians of passwords, user names and IP addresses.Malvin is one of several Russian companies that won lucrative contracts to make equipment to analyze and sort through telecommunications data. Some of those companies, including Malvin, were owned by a Russian holding company, Citadel, which was controlled by Alisher Usmanov. Mr. Usmanov, an oligarch with ties to Mr. Putin, is now the subject of sanctions in the United States, the European Union, Britain and Switzerland.Malvin and Citadel did not respond to requests for comment.Other Nokia documents specified which cables, routers and ports to use to connect to the surveillance system. Network maps showed how gear from other companies, including Cisco, plugged into the SORM boxes. Cisco declined to comment.For Nokia engineers in Russia, the work related to SORM was often mundane. In 2017, a Nokia technician received an assignment to Orel, a city about 225 miles south of Moscow.“Carry out work on the examination of SORM,” he was told.Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting."
