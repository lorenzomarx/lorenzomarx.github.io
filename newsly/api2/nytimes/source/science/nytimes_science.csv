It was first spotted by scientists with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and appeared in satellite images taken on March 17, according to the National Ice Center in the United States.Ice shelves are floating tongues of ice at the end of glaciers that in Antarctica serve as outlets for the continent’s massive ice sheets. Stresses cause cracks in the floating ice, and meltwater and other factors can cause the fissures to erode and grow to a point where the shelf disintegrates rapidly.According to the National Ice Center, the largest fragment of the Conger shelf after the collapse was an iceberg, named C-38, that was about 200 square miles in size.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySign up for the Climate Forward newsletter  Your must-read guide to the climate crisis. Get it sent to your inbox.The loss of a shelf can allow faster movement of the glaciers behind it, which can lead to more rapid ice-sheet loss and thus greater sea-level rise. Ice-shelf loss is a major concern in West Antarctica, where warming related to climate change is having a greater effect than in the east.Several very large glaciers in West Antarctica are already flowing faster and if their ice shelves were to collapse completely, sea levels could rise on the order of 10 feet over centuries.But the two glaciers behind the Conger sheet are small, and even if they were to accelerate, would have minimal effect on sea level, on the order of fractions of an inch over a century or two, said Ted Scambos, a senior researcher at the Earth Science and Observation Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhile some ice shelves have collapsed in West Antarctica — notably the much larger Larsen B, in 2002 — the Conger collapse is the first observed in East Antarctica since the era of satellite imagery began in 1979, said Catherine Walker, a glaciologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.Dr. Walker, who had been monitoring the ice shelf for a few months, said it had been retreating for several years. “It was an unhealthy little ice shelf to begin with,” she said. But it had appeared to become stabilized, she said, between the mainland and a small island.So while the collapse was not a complete surprise, it occurred sooner than expected, she said. She and Dr. Scambos agreed that recent weather in that part of Antarctica may have played a role.In mid-March an atmospheric river, a plume of air heavy with water vapor, swept into East Antarctica from the ocean to the north. It resulted in record-setting warmth in some locations, with temperatures as much as 70 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal for this time of year.Understand the Latest News on Climate ChangeCard 1 of 4Ice shelf collapses. For the first time since satellites began observing Antarctica nearly half a century ago, an ice shelf has collapsed on the eastern part of the continent. The 450-square-mile ice shelf was located in an area known as Wilkes Land; the loss occurred in mid-March.A massive leak. Startlingly large amounts of methane are leaking from wells and pipelines in New Mexico’s Permian Basin, according to a new analysis of aerial data, suggesting that the oil and gas industry may be contributing more to climate change than was previously known.Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. A wide stretch of the Great Barrier Reef has been hit by a sixth mass bleaching event, an alarming indicator that the area is under intense stress from the waters around them, which have been growing steadily warmer as a result of climate change..Enduring drought. Drought conditions are likely to continue across more than half of the continental United States through at least June, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Nearly 60 percent of the continental United States is experiencing drought.The warmth could have led to more surface melting of the Conger ice shelf, helping to further erode its fissures and hastening its collapse. But Dr. Scambos said it was likely that the windy conditions resulting from the atmospheric river, combined with record-low sea ice around Antarctica this season, played a larger role.Sea ice serves as a buffer, damping the swells that roll in to the coast from the Southern Ocean. With little ice, and with the wind stirring the ocean even more, the floating shelf flexed more than it normally would. “The flexing probably weakened the more fixed parts of the ice that held the shelf together,” Dr. Scambos said.“The warm pulse probably didn’t do a lot,” he said, “but wind events and warm temperatures in the air and in the ocean certainly don’t help with ice-shelf stability.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyEast Antarctica has been considered to be the more stable region of Antarctica, with less warming and even ice gains in some areas. The collapse of the Conger ice shelf doesn’t really change that view, Dr. Walker said. “We don’t see any indication that this is going to happen in the rest of East Antarctica anytime soon,” she said.Dr. Scambos, who studies the more at-risk ice shelves and glaciers in West Antarctica, said it will be interesting to see what happens with the glaciers behind Conger. “Every time one of these things happens,” he said, “it tells us a little bit more about how bigger parts of Antarctica are going to respond when bigger events occur.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/25/climate/25cli-antarctica/merlin_204482649_6606d638-7884-4eda-bfac-908c7997ef3e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

The spacecraft found that the dwarf planet, far from being a featureless and frigid orb, was an ostentatious world with epic impact craters, methane ice and nitrogen snow.Two of its mountains, Wright Mons and Piccard Mons, were suspected of being volcanoes. But instead of spewing molten rock, they would be built of, and capable of erupting, ice in a process known as cryovolcanism.After years of close examination of data from New Horizons, scientists think they have spotted evidence of recently erupted ice lava, a sign that Pluto is home to cryovolcanoes that were active in the immediate geologic past.“We tried to find some other way to explain it, but we just really couldn’t,” said Kelsi Singer, a senior research scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and an author of the study, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIf the team is correct, the implications are significant. Any erupting volcano requires a molten fuel source. If these ice lava deposits are young, then the underworld just below this spot on Pluto’s icy shell was, at least to some degree, hot and liquid very recently. And such a finding gives credence to the hypothesis that present-day Pluto is an ocean world, however improbable that may seem for a tiny, icy orb so far from the sun.In the past four decades, possible cryovolcanic features have been spotted throughout the solar system, from the dwarf planet Ceres in the asteroid belt out as far as Neptune’s wintry moon Triton.An icy lava eruption has never been witnessed, but seeing one on a world like Pluto would be nothing short of surreal: The icy lava may slowly extrude from a dome’s vent or fissure as a gelid, mucilaginous mass — something comparable to Silly Putty but made of one or multiple frozen chemical compounds — and largely retain its chunky shape in a low-gravity, exceedingly cold environment.The discovery of Wright Mons and Piccard Mons on Pluto, two icy mountains with central pits that looked like eruptive openings, suggested it too was a member of the cryovolcanic club. But whether these ice volcanoes were genuinely what they looked like, and whether they were still active, proved difficult to determine.Is Pluto a Planet? What’s a Planet, Anyway?More than 15 years after Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet, the debate, even among scientists, continues.After their forensic examination of New Horizons’s flyby images, Dr. Singer and her colleagues suspect that Wright Mons and Piccard Mons are not two big cryovolcanoes. Instead, they are probably colonies of smaller volcanic domes, which are usually made when very gloopy lava slowly erupts and forms squat piles. It appears that many such domes grew in the same area and got squashed together, making two mountainous masses.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut is this cryovolcanic colony still alive?The team noticed that much of the region is coated in irregular, undulating patches mostly made of water-ice. This terrain looks nothing like contorted deposits elsewhere on Pluto formed by erosion. That leaves one likely explanation: It was made by water-ice lava flows. And as their deposits lack craters, the flows erupted close to the geologic present.Icy eruptions may be alien to this planet, but some geologic fundamentals are probably familiar: Just as Earth’s active volcanoes sit atop reservoirs of partially molten rock, Pluto’s volcanic domes may sit atop partially liquid reservoirs of water-ice. But in the dwarf planet’s case, these reservoirs may feed off one big ocean.Earlier studies have suggested Pluto has a subsurface ocean, although explaining its existence is difficult.A world this small would have lost the heat from its formation long ago, and it does not contain enough radioactive, heat-releasing elements in its rocky core, so any liquid below its icy outer shell should be frozen. Various heat-trapping hypotheses are also currently impossible to prove.It’s not fanciful to imagine frozen worlds containing oceans. Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, which orbits Saturn, both have incontrovertible internal oceans. But the gravitational interactions with their planets and nearby moons thought to be heating them are not applicable to Pluto.And yet Pluto’s youthful cryovolcanic terrain bolsters the case for its own subterranean seas, while adding evidence to two theories: that ocean worlds are commonplace in the cosmos, and that scientists cannot always explain how their existences are possible.Ultimately the data from New Horizons and other spacecraft are continually teaching researchers the same lesson. “We needed to have a better imagination,” said Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University not involved with the study.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/science/29sci-pluto1/29sci-pluto1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

A praying mantis consumes her mate after copulation, termites suck blood out of wounded peers, and mosquitoes snack on larvae. But how far back does this gruesome mode of dining go in the history of life feeding on life?Previous studies place the earliest cannibalism about 450 million years ago in the Late Ordovician period. But a study published last month in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology says even older evidence of cannibalism can be found in a 514-million-year-old treasure trove of trilobites on an island off the South Australian coast, at a site called Emu Bay. There, old wounds on trilobite shells abound, and fossil excrements, likely produced by trilobites, contain yet more trilobite shells. These hint that cannibalism could be dated to the early Cambrian era — over 50 million years earlier than previously thought.Paleontologists consider a preserved meal inside fossilized guts the best evidence that one animal consumed another. But such fossils are rare.The site at Emu Bay, however, had optimal conditions to preserve a different kind of evidence for who ate whom: fossilized injuries and fossilized feces.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyTrilobites have hard exoskeletons, like modern shelly arthropods — think of horseshoe crabs or lobsters. When trilobites escaped attacks, their shells recorded those close calls with bite marks, crushed sections and missing chunks.In the new study, Russell Bicknell, a paleontologist at the University of New England in Australia, focused on healed injuries in two trilobite species from Emu Bay: Redlichia takooensis and Redlichia rex. Dr. Bicknell collected 38 fossils of the two species from Emu Bay, some from fieldwork and others in the collection of the South Australian Museum. As he scrutinized the fossils, Dr. Bicknell checked for patterns that might tell him about attack styles, and therefore who the attacker was.The specimens with healed injuries — trilobites that survived attacks, including R. rex — were big, so something even bigger must have attacked them. Small trilobites with scars were nowhere to be seen, and Dr. Bicknell had a suspicion about where they ended up: within fossilized excrement, also known as coprolites.ImageThe Buck Quarry in Emu Bay in South Australia where the fossils were found.Credit...Russell BicknellThe coprolites at Emu Bay were big, at least 10 percent the length of an adult trilobite’s body. It’s often impossible to tell which species a shell fragment came from, Dr. Bicknell said, but the researchers are confident the coprolite fragments reflect the two species in the study.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Everything smaller gets consumed and turned into these lovely coprolites,” he said. “Everything larger gets something taken out of it, but it was able to get away from the attack.”The attacker, he surmised, was most likely R. rex, which grew to nearly 10 inches long, making it the “king trilobite” of its age. Dr. Bicknell describes R. rex as “a horseshoe crab, but on steroids.” He sees it scuttling around on the Cambrian sea floor, hunting easy, small targets, including smaller members of its own species.Thus if R. rex produced the feces, as Dr. Bicknell suspects, the carnage at Emu Bay represents the oldest example of cannibalism in the fossil record.Loren Babcock, a paleontologist at Ohio State University who has studied trilobite predation for decades, said he hoped that similar-scale studies would be conducted elsewhere to look for comparable patterns or predation marks and perhaps even gut contents, which he noted could be revealed using X-rays and micro-CT scans. Whether trilobites made the coprolites, he said, “is an open question, but trilobites are a good guess for the time being.”Dr. Babcock added that he would be surprised if no trilobites had been cannibalistic. But he also thought it was possible that another predator of the Cambrian era, Anomalocaris, produced some of the coprolites at Emu Bay used in Dr. Bicknell’s study.Dr. Bicknell doubts that Anomalocaris, despite its size, had the ability to crush trilobites with its spindly appendages.Allison Daley, a University of Lausanne paleontologist who was not involved in the study, said that the size of the coprolites at Emu Bay helped convince her that large trilobites like R. rex could have been responsible for the site’s predation.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“There just aren’t many things big enough to make those coprolites,” she said.But she added that it was unlikely that trilobites had been purely cannibalistic.“Let’s face it, if you could find something to eat that wasn’t mineralized,” she said, referring to trilobite shells, “you’d probably preferentially eat that.”An entirely cannibalistic species wouldn’t last very long.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/25/science/25tb-cannibal-trilobite1/merlin_204423270_eadefca3-9248-42f0-92bd-599e7b25de3f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

Sullivan, a professor of mathematics at Stony Brook University and the City University of New York Graduate Center, is the winner of this year’s Abel Prize — the equivalent of a Nobel in mathematics.In its citation, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the organization that administers the Abel, said Dr. Sullivan was honored “for his groundbreaking contributions to topology in its broadest sense, and in particular its algebraic, geometric and dynamical aspects.”Topology is the study of space and shapes, and most of Dr. Sullivan’s work involves what mathematicians call manifolds — the higher-dimensional versions of two-dimensional surfaces. While that work is abstract, some of his recent research in fluid flows and turbulence could add to the understanding of the paths of hurricanes, the dispersions of air pollutants and the whorls of vortices behind airplane wings.There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics, and for decades, the most prestigious awards in math were the Fields Medals, awarded in small batches every four years to the most accomplished mathematicians who are 40 or younger.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Abel, named after Niels Henrik Abel, a Norwegian mathematician, is set up more like the Nobels. Since 2003 it has been given annually to highlight important advances in mathematics. Previous laureates include Andrew J. Wiles, who proved Fermat’s last theorem and is now at the University of Oxford; John F. Nash Jr., whose life was portrayed in the movie “A Beautiful Mind”; and Karen Uhlenbeck, an emeritus professor at the University of Texas at Austin who in 2019 became the first woman to receive an Abel.Ulrike Tillmann, a mathematician at the University of Oxford who served on the Abel committee, said that given Dr. Sullivan’s “absolutely fantastic work” in both algebraic topology and dynamical systems, “it was a very easy decision to make.”Dr. Sullivan said he had a “nice reaction” to the news.“I’m 81,” he said. “They remember me.”The prize is accompanied by 7.5 million Norwegian kroner, or about $850,000.Dr. Sullivan was born in Port Huron, Mich., in 1941; his family later moved to Houston.In a parallel universe, Dr. Sullivan perhaps spent his career as a chemical engineer. That was his major at Rice University until his sophomore year. One day during an advanced calculus lecture, the professor drew two shapes on the blackboard — one a circle, the other more blobby, like a kidney. He then said you could stretch either one to fit on the other.That was not particularly surprising. But then the professor said there was a way — and essentially just one way — to do the stretching such that the stretching was the same in all directions.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“This blew my mind,” Dr. Sullivan recalled. “This was not like mathematics I’d learned up to that point. It was much deeper.”He switched from chemical engineering to math, and he completed a doctorate at Princeton in 1966.Dr. Sullivan was an early adopter of a technique known as surgery theory. Using this method allowed for innovative mathematical explorations, such as cutting two round holes in a sphere and then gluing one end of a tube to each of the holes on the outside of the sphere, producing a kettleball-like shape.That allowed mathematicians to study what kinds of topologies could be stitched together.Dr. Sullivan used surgery theory to study how manifolds could be divided into simpler pieces: For example, a two-dimensional manifold like the surface of a sphere can be approximated by triangles that are then glued back together.It was known that all triangulations of two-dimensional surfaces are equivalent, and the same was true for three-dimensional manifolds.It was conjectured that the assertion was true for manifolds of all dimensions, and Dr. Sullivan showed that it was almost always true in five dimensions or more.It turns out there are a few exceptions where two triangulations of a five-dimensional manifold are not equivalent. Other mathematicians subsequently showed that the conjecture was not true for many four-dimensional manifolds.Later, Dr. Sullivan shifted his focus to dynamical systems, although those problems still involved manifolds. “Dynamical systems happen inside manifolds,” he said. “It’s a way to return to that geometric context.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOne of his lasting contributions is what is known as the “Sullivan dictionary,” which links dynamics with three-dimensional geometry. That enabled him to prove a mathematical conjecture that had been unsolved since the 1920s.The deep and unexpected connections between these disciplines also helped Dr. Sullivan figure out the mathematical underpinnings of a phenomenon known as period doubling that had been discovered and studied by physicists.It was not an easy problem. “You had to find the hypothesis that made it true,” Dr. Sullivan said. “It took eight years.”“He ushered in a whole new theory of complex dynamical systems,” said Curtis T. McMullen, a Harvard mathematician who completed his graduate studies with Dr. Sullivan as his adviser. “The tools that he used, and even more so the analogies that he put to the fore, have been guiding the field ever since.”Dr. Sullivan has since also tackled problems in fluid dynamics.When Dr. Sullivan accepted the Balzan Prize for Mathematics in 2014, he said he hoped to test whether the theoretical tools he had developed could be applied to practical problems like hurricane prediction and the air resistance of aircraft wings.Dr. Sullivan said he could not yet show that he had come up with better computer models. “But I would say, we’re on the right track,” he said.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/science/23abel/23abel-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

Humidity keeps rainforests green but does little to preserve bodies, leading to a dearth of ancient skeletal remains in Neotropical regions such as Central America.But deep in the jungles of Belize, under the dry refuge of two rock shelters, the skeletons of people who died as many as 9,600 years ago have been exceptionally well preserved. Their bones offer a rare glimpse into the region’s ancient genetic history, which is largely unknown.A group of scientists has now extracted these ancient people’s DNA, offering new insight into the genetic history of people in the Maya region. The paper was published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The researchers identified a previously unknown mass migration from the south more than 5,600 years ago that preceded the advent of intensive maize farming in the region. This migration of people, who are most closely related to present-day speakers of the Chibchan languages, contributed more than 50 percent of the ancestry of Mayan-speaking peoples today.Lisa Lucero, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who specializes in the ancestral Maya and was not involved with the research, said the new results “have the potential to revise and rewrite the early history of the First Americans.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyXavier Roca-Rada, a doctoral student at the University of Adelaide, said the results “fill a gap between the oldest previously studied individuals from the Maya region and the time before the settling of Mesoamerica.”The new paper emerged from ongoing excavations led by the authors Keith Prufer, an environmental archaeologist at the University of New Mexico, and Douglas Kennett, an archaeologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The researchers have been excavating two rock shelters in the Bladen Nature Reserve, a remote and protected area of Belize that kept the sites, which were used as cemeteries, undisturbed for thousands of years. “People just kept going back to them over and over and over again and burying the dead,” Dr. Prufer said.The shelters were also occupied by the living, who made tools and cooked, evidenced by the buried bones of armadillos, deer and a type of rodent called a paca, Dr. Prufer said. The very bottom of the excavated pit held a piece of a giant sloth, which may have even predated human occupation of the shelter, he said.The excavations also revealed a secret, formerly slimy layer of protection underground. Around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, before the classic period of the Maya, people harvested tiny Pachychilus snails for food. “They would boil them and lop off the end of the shell and eat the flesh out of them,” Dr. Prufer said. Whoever inhabited these shelters feasted on these snails, and their discarded shells shielded bodies buried below. “This layer of snails actually protected the lower burials from the Maya digging through them,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDr. Kennett and Dr. Prufer study these early burials to understand how the region transitioned from hunting and gathering to the development of intensive agriculture of maize, chili peppers and manioc (also called cassava). In a 2020 paper, they described evidence of maize consumption in the bones of individuals who lived 4,000 to 4,700 years ago.ImageA cliff face covering a rock shelter in the rainforest of the Bladen Nature Reserve in Belize.Credit...Keith PruferDavid Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, led the extraction of ancient DNA from 20 individuals buried in the shelters over the course of 6,000 years. The analysis revealed several human migrations into the Maya region, in what is now southeastern Mexico and northern Central America.They found three distinct groups: one living 7,300 to 9,600 years ago, another living between 3,700 and 5,600 years ago and a third group of modern Maya people. The first group appears genetically linked to a southward migration through the Americas during the Pleistocene. But the second group was related genetically to the ancestors of Chibchan speakers living farther south.The authors hypothesize that this population turnover came from a mass migration from the south. “That was the spectacular result,” Dr. Kennett said.The finding overturns an old assumption that farming technology spread through the Americas by the diffusion of crops and practices — the spread of knowledge as opposed to the spread of people, Dr. Reich said. The new results suggest this migration was critical to spreading farming, such as a scenario in which Chibchan speakers migrated northward with varieties of maize, which they then cultivated and spread in local populations, the authors write.“People were actually moving into the region from the south, carrying these domesticated plants and also the systems of knowledge about how to grow them,” Dr. Kennett said.David Mora-Marín, a linguistic anthropologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an author on the paper, conducted an analysis of early Chibchan and Mayan languages. He found that a term for maize had diffused from the Chibchan language into Mayan languages, further supporting the idea of a Chibchan origin of maize.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe field of ancient DNA has been criticized for a lack of ethics or appropriate engagement with communities that may be descended from the ancient humans being studied.Dr. Kennett and Dr. Prufer conducted their archaeological research with the Ya’axché Conservation Trust, a Belizean nongovernmental organization that is largely staffed by descendants of Maya communities. The researchers consulted with these communities, presented results from studies and translated summaries of findings into the Mopan and Q’eqchi’ languages at the locals’ request. In the discussions, the communities expressed a desire to learn more about the diets and precolonial family units of the ancient people living in the cave. Because of these conversations, the authors placed a greater emphasis on these topics in the paper, Dr. Kennett said.Krystal Tsosie, a genetics researcher at Vanderbilt University, said she wanted to see a more detailed description of how the community’s feedback influenced the paper. Dr. Tsosie added, “The process of proper engagement also means properly and transparently crediting the community members for informing and enriching the research.”Ripan Malhi, a genetic anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, noted that the authors uploaded the ancient DNA data to a public database “with no safeguards or limitations on use indicated.” Ancient DNA can offer a shortcut to the DNA of modern communities without their consent. “This may have implications for the present-day Maya in the region,” he said.Dr. Lucero and Mr. Roca-Rada said that more data was needed to prove the researchers’ hypothesis that a southern migration had brought maize to the Maya region. To Dr. Lucero, the question is whether researchers should acquire that data. “Should we dig up ancestors?” he asked. “Would we want someone to dig up ours to answer interesting yet nonvital research questions?”Dr. Kennett and Dr. Prufer last visited Belize in January 2020 to present the preliminary results from the new paper to Maya communities. The pandemic has since prohibited the researchers’ return, but Dr. Prufer said they hoped to go back this summer to continue excavating and “keep our promise to return each year that we work and update everybody.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/science/22sci-mayan-dna1/22sci-mayan-dna1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

With little natural competition to control the big snake’s numbers, the situation looks desperate. But new observations suggest that the bobcat, a wildcat native to Florida, might be able to help.A team of ecologists collected evidence recently of a bobcat devouring python eggs in the Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, and last month reported their findings in the journal Ecology and Evolution. It’s hard to say whether this individual cat was more adventurous than the average bobcat, but it suggests one potential way the python’s proliferation could be limited — by other animals eating their unhatched young.The event was captured by a motion sensitive camera that a team led by Andrea Currylow, an ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, deployed in June 2021 near the nest of a large female Burmese python. The camera had been put in place to better understand the reproductive biology of these huge snakes. A few hours after installation, the snake slithered away and the camera snapped shots of a bobcat arriving and eating python eggs during the early evening.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We were completely floored,” Dr. Currylow said. “We had no idea that the nests of these snakes were being depredated.”ImageThe bobcat eating the eggs.Credit...U.S.G.S.Apparently the feline decided that it rather liked what it had found because it came back for another snack three times that night. The next morning the bobcat returned to cache uneaten eggs in the ground to consume at a later date. That evening the bobcat returned again, but, this time, the python was back on her nest. Weighing about 20 pounds, the feline was clearly aware that the 115-pound python posed a serious threat and, rather than trying to eat more eggs, it padded around the nest at a safe distance for a few minutes before leaving.The next night the camera took a photo of the two predators in a face-off. Apparently, the bobcat felt the clutch was worth fighting for because it returned in the morning and aggravated the python enough to prompt an attack. The strike, which missed the cat, triggered the camera. So too did a counterattack by the bobcat as it made swipes with its claws at the enormous reptile.ImageThe bobcat took a swipe.Credit...U.S.G.S.Precisely how the duel ended is unclear but when the researchers arrived that evening to collect the camera, they found the snake sitting on a badly damaged nest.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We thought the snake must have caused the damage herself by somehow crushing her own eggs,” Dr. Currylow said, “but then we saw the photos and, well, it was just incredible.”The researchers removed the snake and analyzed the nest in detail. They found that 42 eggs had been destroyed and that 22 were damaged but potentially viable. They collected these eggs and incubated them. None hatched.While it is possible that this interaction was just an isolated incident, it is also possible that native species are beginning to respond to the presence of the python.“Most cat species adapt their diet to what is available, so bobcats predating on python eggs is actually not that surprising” said Mathias Tobler, a wildlife ecologist at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.Reptile eggs are already a part of the Florida bobcat diet. Bobcats are known to eat sea turtle eggs, and these may have similarities to python eggs.“Egg hunting in bobcats is really a learned behavior,” Dr. Tobler said. “Once some individuals figure out how to prey on python eggs they could potentially do this quite regularly.”Of course, the big difference between python nests and those of sea turtles is that the snake nests are usually guarded. But Dr. Currylow also points out that female pythons typically go without food until their eggs are about to hatch. That might be the main reason the bobcat survived its adventure.Whether these felines will eat enough eggs to turn the tide against the python invasion remains to be seen.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/28/science/28tb-bobcatversuspython1/28tb-bobcatversuspython1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

His family’s carpet business was struggling.Opportunity arrived in the form of two developers who wanted to build a power plant in Grant Town, just outside Mr. Manchin’s district. Mr. Manchin, whose grandfather went to work in the mines at age 9 and whose uncle died in a mining accident, helped the developers clear bureaucratic hurdles.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThen he did something beyond routine constituent services. He went into business with the Grant Town power plant.Mr. Manchin supplied a type of low-grade coal mixed with rock and clay known as “gob” that is typically cast aside as junk by mining companies but can be burned to produce electricity. In addition, he arranged to receive a slice of the revenue from electricity generated by the plant — electric bills paid by his constituents.The deal inked decades ago has made Mr. Manchin, now 74, a rich man.While the fact that Mr. Manchin owns a coal business is well-known, an examination by The New York Times offers a more detailed portrait of the degree to which Mr. Manchin’s business has been interwoven with his official actions. He created his business while a state lawmaker in anticipation of the Grant Town plant, which has been the sole customer for his gob for the past 20 years, according to federal data. At key moments over the years, Mr. Manchin used his political influence to benefit the plant. He urged a state official to approve its air pollution permit, pushed fellow lawmakers to support a tax credit that helped the plant, and worked behind the scenes to facilitate a rate increase that drove up revenue for the plant — and electricity costs for West Virginians.Records show that several energy companies have held ownership stakes in the power plant, major corporations with interests far beyond West Virginia. At various points, those corporations have sought to influence the Senate, including legislation before committees on which Mr. Manchin sat, creating what ethics experts describe as a conflict of interest.As the pivotal vote in an evenly split Senate, Mr. Manchin has blocked legislation that would speed the country’s transition to wind, solar and other clean energy and away from coal, oil and gas, the burning of which is dangerously heating the planet. With the war in Ukraine and resulting calls to boycott Russian gas, Mr. Manchin has joined Republicans to press for more American gas and oil production to fill the gap on the world market.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut as the Grant Town plant continues to burn coal and pay dividends to Mr. Manchin, it has harmed West Virginians economically, costing them hundreds of millions of dollars in excess electricity fees. That’s because gob is a less efficient power source than regular coal.Mr. Manchin declined an interview request. His spokeswoman, Sam Runyon, did not respond to detailed questions about his business interests, and whether those interests affected his actions as a public official. Senate ethics rules forbid members from acting on legislation to further their financial interests or those of immediate family members. There is no indication that Mr. Manchin broke any laws.In the past, Mr. Manchin has repeatedly said that he has acted to protect valued industries in West Virginia, which ranked second in coal production and fifth in natural gas in 2020, according to federal data. He has defended his personal business ties to the Grant Town plant, telling the Charleston Gazette in 1996, “I did it to keep West Virginia people working.”This account is based on thousands of pages of documents from lawsuits, land records, state regulatory hearings, lobbying and financial disclosures, federal energy data and other records spanning more than three decades. The Times also spoke with three dozen former business associates, current and former government officials, and industry experts.The documents and interviews show that at every level of Mr. Manchin’s political career, from state lawmaker to U.S. senator, his official actions have benefited his financial interest in the Grant Town plant, blurring the line between public business and private gain.ImageCredit...Tom Brenner for The New York TimesThe private company behind Mr. Manchin’s millionsMr. Manchin and his wife owned assets worth between $4.5 million to $12.8 million in 2020, according to Senate financial disclosure forms, which provide only a range with few specifics. Mr. Manchin, who drives a silver Maserati Levante, reported dozens of assets, including bank accounts, mutual funds, real estate and ownership stakes in more than a dozen companies.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut the bulk of Mr. Manchin’s reported income since entering the Senate has come from one company: Enersystems, Inc., which he founded with his brother Roch Manchin in 1988, the year before the Grant Town plant got a permit from the state of West Virginia.Enersystems Inc. is now run by Mr. Manchin’s son, Joseph Manchin IV. In 2020, it paid Mr. Manchin $491,949, according to his filings, almost three times his salary as a United States senator. From 2010 through 2020, Mr. Manchin reported a total of $5.6 million from the company.The Biden Administration’s Environmental AgendaPresident Biden is pushing stronger regulations, but faces a narrow path to achieving his goals in the fight against global warming.Clean Energy: President Biden wants to eliminate planet-warming emissions from the power sector by 2035, but the nation’s biggest federal utility is betting on gas.Tailpipe Standards: The administration is moving to introduce new limits on pollution from heavy trucks and restore California’s ability to set its own rules on auto emissions.Air Pollution: The administration recently restored regulations on the release of mercury, a neurotoxin linked to developmental damage in children, from coal-burning power plants.Wastewater Projects: The infrastructure bill includes funding to upgrade sewer and drainage systems. Will the money go where it’s most needed?Taming Wildfires: A plan by the administration to reduce the danger of fires is aiming to make forests more resilient through thinning and intentional burning.Mr. Manchin describes Enersystems in disclosure forms as a “contract services and material provider for utility plants.”The privately held company has no website. Its headquarters consist of a cluster of small rooms on the ground floor of a brick office complex in Fairmont, W.Va., that bears Mr. Manchin’s name. It has just two employees, according to filings with the West Virginia secretary of state.When a reporter recently visited, Mr. Manchin’s son was the only person there. “We’re not doing interviews,” he said. “No comment.”Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that Enersystems supplies a specific type of coal burned to generate electricity. And since 2002 — as far back as that data goes — Mr. Manchin’s company has had just one customer: the Grant Town power plant.ImageMountains of gobThe community of Grant Town was built around one of the largest underground coal mines in the world. But since the mine closed in 1985, every other business has shuttered, along with the school. Many of the buildings have been condemned.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDespite its struggles, the community had something valuable to outsiders: mountains and mountains of gob.Gob, an acronym for “garbage of bituminous,” is waste coal — low-quality material dug from a mine that is mixed with rock and clay, making it harder and less efficient to burn. For decades, dark gray gob piled up on the ground outside coal mines in West Virginia, barren heaps often reaching several stories high.But in 1978, worried about the country’s dependence on foreign oil, Congress passed a law to encourage alternative energy sources. That led to the opening of several gob-burning plants, including Grant Town.The developers who planned the Grant Town plant created American Bituminous Power Partners, or AmBit, to build the plant. AmBit signed a long-term contract with the local utility, Monongahela Power, to buy the electricity it produced from gob.But before AmBit could start construction, federal agencies raised environmental concerns. The company got help from Joe Manchin.‘He was pretty smooth about it’Mr. Manchin grew up in politics. His father and grandfather both served as mayor of his hometown. His uncle, A. James Manchin, was West Virginia’s treasurer. Mr. Manchin’s father was close friends with Arch A. Moore Jr., a three-term West Virginia governor whose daughter, Shelly Moore Capito, is currently the state’s Republican U.S. senator.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThose ties helped Mr. Manchin get things done, said Jack Spadaro, then a supervisor for West Virginia and neighboring states with the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which regulates coal mines.“He could control a bloc of votes in northern West Virginia,” Mr. Spadaro said. “If you got the Manchins behind you, you could really do something.”Mr. Manchin used that influence on behalf of AmBit.ImageTrucks being loaded at the Humphrey No. 7 Mine in Maidsville, W. Va. The Environmental Protection Agency was concerned the Grant Town plant would be too close to an existing coal-burning plant, resulting in excessive levels of sulfur dioxide, a threat to human health and plant life, according to documents obtained through a public records request.Dale Farley, the West Virginia state official in charge of issuing air pollution permits at the time, recalled in an interview that Mr. Manchin approached him about approving the Grant Town plant. “He was pretty smooth about it,” said Mr. Farley, now 72 and retired. “But he let it be known that he was definitely interested in the project going forward.”Mr. Farley struck an agreement with Monongahela Power, also called Mon Power, to limit emissions from the nearby plant, allowing the Grant Town plant to proceed. He informed the E.P.A., copying Mr. Manchin on the letter, and issued the permit for Grant Town. (Mr. Manchin’s intervention was reported by the Charleston Gazette in 1996.)Had he known at the time that Mr. Manchin planned to have a financial relationship with the plant, “it would have bothered me,” Mr. Farley said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyGuaranteed incomeAfter helping to win the permit for the plant, Mr. Manchin began to profit from it.On Oct. 5, 1989, one of Mr. Manchin’s companies, Transcon Inc., bought an old coal mine in Barrackville, five miles south of Grant Town, for $380,000, according to records in the Marion County Courthouse. That same day, he sold the property and its gob piles to AmBit for $500,000 — a profit of $120,000.But Mr. Manchin was not only a supplier of fuel to the Grant Town plant. He also got a share of its revenue.Shortly before the plant opened, he signed another deal with AmBit, involving yet another old coal mine that Mr. Manchin owned, this one south of Farmington, Mr. Manchin’s hometown. He leased that mine, along with the gob on that property, to AmBit. In return, AmBit agreed to pay not just rent to Mr. Manchin, but also one percent of the gross revenue from electricity generated by burning gob from Mr. Manchin’s old coal mine, according to a copy of the lease at the courthouse.Those terms, while not unheard-of, were generous to Mr. Manchin, said Stefanie Hines, a lawyer who teaches at West Virginia University and specializes in mineral rights. “These aren’t deals you give to everybody,” Ms. Hines said.Once the Grant Town plant opened, Mr. Manchin urged his fellow state lawmakers to back a tax credit for power plants that burn gob, according to an account at the time in the Charleston Gazette. It passed the following year.Just three plants in the entire state burned gob; Grant Town was one of them. At the time, Mr. Manchin dismissed suggestions of self-dealing, noting that he had broken no rules.As the Grant Town plant continued to buy Mr. Manchin’s gob, his political ambitions grew. He was elected secretary of state, in 2000. Four years later Mr. Manchin rode a landslide into the governor’s mansion in Charleston. From that position, he helped the power plant win an even more coveted prize.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHigher Prices, Greater BurdenShortly after the Grant Town plant began burning gob, AmBit said the operating costs were higher than expected, and the company was going to need more money for the electricity it was supplying to Mr. Manchin’s constituents.Company executives sought approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission, which balked, in part because the utility, Mon Power, opposed the request.In 2006, with Mr. Manchin now occupying the governor’s office, AmBit again sought a rate increase. But this time, Mon Power supported its request.The change in position followed Mr. Manchin’s involvement, according to people involved at the time.AmBit enlisted help from Stanley Sears, whose company, Horizon Ventures, owns the land on which Grant Town sits. Mr. Sears knew Mr. Manchin and his family, and paid the governor a visit.ImageSpeaking at the 35th Annual West Virginia Mining Symposium in 2008 while governor.Credit...Jeff Gentner/Associated Press“Mr. Joe Manchin assigned his chief of staff, Mr. Larry Puccio to our — to help us,” Mr. Sears said, according to testimony that Mr. Sears gave in 2018 as part of a legal dispute between Horizon and AmBit. “Larry Puccio intervened with Monongahela Power Company and their lobbyists.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAfter that meeting, Mr. Sears testified, Mon Power supported the rate increase. The Public Service Commission, led by a Manchin appointee, approved it.The consequences of that rate increase turned out to be enormous. Since 2016, Grant Town has cost Mon Power $117 million more than it would have spent to buy that power from other sources, according to documents filed last year with the Public Service Commission. The utility had little choice but to buy the electricity; its contract with Grant Town doesn’t expire until 2036.Mr. Puccio didn’t respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Mr. Sears declined to comment. A spokesman for Mon Power, Will Boye, said the utility “put the request in front of regulators and other stakeholders who could evaluate whether the rate increase and preservation of Grant Town were in the best interests of customers and the state.”The extra costs were passed on to residents, burdening ratepayers in one of the poorest states in the nation.Once in the Senate, business improvesImageBeing sworn in to the U.S. Senate by Joe Biden in 2010.Credit...Drew Angerer/The New York TimesAfter Mr. Manchin ascended to a position where he could influence national policy, his family business began earning more revenue from AmBit.In the middle of his second term as governor, Mr. Manchin handily won a special election in 2010 to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of Robert Byrd. From a seat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Manchin had an ability to shape federal policy governing oil, gas and coal.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHe became one of the most vocal opponents to the E.P.A.’s proposed limits on emissions of mercury and other hazardous substances from power plants. The mercury regulations, which eventually took effect, were particularly threatening to plants like Grant Town, because gob generates more mercury per kilowatt of electricity when burned than traditional coal, according to Lisa Evans, senior counsel at the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice.Mr. Manchin also sought to protect coal plants from more stringent regulation of coal ash, which gob-fired plants generate in higher volumes than conventional coal-burning facilities. He sponsored legislation in 2016 that gave regulatory authority over coal ash to states, rather than allowing federal regulators to dictate terms.Mr. Manchin easily won a full Senate term in 2012 and re-election in 2018, and became a top recipient of campaign contributions from the mining, oil and gas industries.Meanwhile, AmBit increasingly bought its fuel from Mr. Manchin’s company, to the point that it got 80 percent of its coal waste from the Manchin family business in 2020, compared to one-quarter when he first entered the Senate.Reached by phone, AmBit’s executive director, Kenneth Niemann, agreed to answer written questions for this article but then did not respond to them.Hidden ties to large corporationsOn the surface, Mr. Manchin has a business relationship with a single power plant in West Virginia.But determining the players behind AmBit, the owner of the Grant Town power plant, is a bit like handling a set of Russian nesting dolls.At various points, three major companies — Edison International, NRG Energy and Tokyo-based Sumitomo — owned a significant share of AmBit, through a series of holding companies that had the effect of obscuring their involvement, records show.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAnd while all three companies partly owned the Grant Town plant, which was paying Mr. Manchin, their representatives lobbied the Senate on dozens of bills handled by the committees on which Mr. Manchin sat, according to Senate lobbying disclosure forms. Lobbyists are not required to identify specific pieces of legislation or name lawmakers with whom they meet.ImageMr. Manchin’s AmBit ties put him in a position to help craft, support or block legislation that affected Edison, NRG or Sumitomo. And through their ownership of the Grant Town plant, those companies had influence over decisions that could affect Mr. Manchin’s income.When asked if Sumitomo or its subsidiaries had lobbied Mr. Manchin or his staff from 2010 through 2020, Sumitomo spokeswoman Amy Babcock said, “No, not to our knowledge.” A spokeswoman for NRG, Laura Avant, said the company’s lobbying “was not targeted” at Mr. Manchin during 2014 when NRG owned a stake in the Grant Town plant.Edison would not say whether it had lobbied Mr. Manchin while the company owned part of the Grant Town plant. “Edison International has a responsibility to work with legislators on policies that best serve our customers,” said Jeffrey T. Monford, a spokesman for Edison. “We abide by all rules around those communications.”Ms. Runyon, the spokeswoman for Mr. Manchin, would not say whether Mr. Manchin had ever been lobbied by Sumitomo, NRG or Edison while those companies owned a stake in Grant Town. “Throughout the entirety of Senator Manchin’s public service career, he has always been in full compliance with ethics and financial disclosure rules,” Ms. Runyon said in a statement.Mr. Manchin’s ties to AmBit left him in a complicated position, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in government ethics. He was in a position to help craft, support or block legislation that affected Edison, NRG or Sumitomo. At the same time, through their ownership of the Grant Town plant, those companies had influence over decisions that could affect Mr. Manchin’s income.Mr. Manchin’s case demonstrates the need to tighten ethics rules, Ms. Clark said. “We care where the income stream comes from,” she said. “What you don’t want is essentially members of Congress to own companies that then become methods or mechanisms for the Sumitomos of the world to get in good with members of Congress.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyStopping Biden’s climate billImageDemonstrators gathered near Senator Manchin’s yacht at the Wharf Marina in Washington in October.Credit...Kenny Holston for The New York TimesIn 2020, Mr. Manchin’s power reached new heights.Mr. Biden was elected president in part on a promise to address climate change. Making good on that pledge hinges on moving legislation through a Senate that is split 50 Republicans to 48 Democrats and their two Independent allies. With Republicans unanimously opposed to most legislation introduced by Senate Democrats, any single Democrat can stop a bill by withholding support.Last summer and fall, Mr. Manchin blocked the spending bill that contained Mr. Biden’s climate proposals, which had included penalties for power companies that did not reduce their coal use. But as those negotiations were underway in Washington, a different dispute was unfolding in West Virginia — one that may have affected Mr. Manchin’s incentives for ultimately opposing the federal climate bill.For years, AmBit had warned that tighter greenhouse gas regulations could shutter the Grant Town plant. The company said it needed cash partly as a cushion against any new government limits on pollution. Last May, AmBit asked Mon Power to cancel the remainder of its contract, which expires in 2036, in exchange for a payment from Mon Power of as much as $200 million or more. That would allow Mon Power to find another source of electricity, maybe at a lower cost, and AmBit could try to find another customer for electricity from its Grant Town plant.The stakes for Mr. Manchin were high. Grant Town was the only remaining power plant in his state that burned gob. If new federal climate rules put Grant Town out of business, his company would have no other potential customers for its waste coal.Mon Power refused the request for a buyout. So AmBit turned to the Public Service Commission, asking it to force Mon Power to reconsider. In November, just as discussions between Mr. Manchin and the White House over the climate bill were reaching their peak, the commission held a hearing in Charleston to consider AmBit’s request.In a filing to the commission, Richard J. Halloran, a founder and owner of AmBit, said that failing to get a buyout “will give us less protection against the anti fossil fuel (coal) sentiment and legislation and taxation.” (Mr. Halloran declined to comment.)AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe commission’s chairwoman, Charlotte R. Lane, expressed skepticism, noting that just a few years had passed since the commission had granted the company its latest rate increase. “Now you’re back,” Ms. Lane said, according to the transcript. “I am somewhat perplexed at what you are doing.”On Dec. 29, the commission rejected AmBit’s request, and with it the chances of a financial buffer against tighter climate rules for Mr. Manchin’s most important customer.Ten days before the Public Service Commission announced its decision, Mr. Manchin said in a statement that he could not support the president’s bill, effectively dooming it.Ms. Runyon, the spokeswoman for Mr. Manchin, did not directly respond to a question about whether Mr. Manchin’s ties to Grant Town influenced his decision to oppose the bill. “From the beginning, Senator Manchin has clearly articulated the reasons he could not support [the legislation] — rising inflation, the global pandemic and geopolitical unrest around the world,” Ms. Runyon said in a statement.But among the reasons Mr. Manchin gave at the time was the bill’s effect on the power sector.“We have invested billions of dollars into clean energy technologies so we can continue to lead the world in reducing emissions through innovation,” Mr. Manchin said in December. “But to do so at a rate that is faster than technology or the markets allow will have catastrophic consequences.”The statement made no mention of Mr. Manchin’s ties to Grant Town.-Kitty Bennett, Dionne Searcey and Steve Eder contributed reporting.Image","null"

That could be a boon to the space dreams of Jeff Bezos.As part of Artemis, NASA’s program to send astronauts back to the moon, the agency in 2019 looked to hire two companies to provide the landers to take its astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon. But with insufficient financing from Congress, the agency decided in April last year to give just one contract, to SpaceX.Other companies would have the opportunity to compete for future missions, NASA officials said.On Wednesday, Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, said the space agency would soon announce a competition to develop a second lunar lander.“I promised competition,” Mr. Nelson said, “so here it is.”The second company would share NASA’s moon missions — about one a year over the course of a decade or so — with SpaceX. “These are not isolated missions,” Mr. Nelson said. “Each is going to build on the past progress.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySimilar to SpaceX’s contract last year, the second company would receive financing for two landings — one without astronauts to demonstrate the abilities of the spacecraft, then a second mission with astronauts.Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration systems development, said the aim would be for a crewed mission to occur in 2026 or 2027.The lunar landers follow NASA’s recent approach of seeking fixed-price contracts, setting certain requirements but encouraging innovation by allowing private companies to come up with their own designs to meet the agency’s needs and compete on price. That approach led to SpaceX’s capsule that ferries astronauts to and from the International Space Station. In the past, NASA generally led the development of rockets and spacecraft, and companies were paid to carry out the plans, usually at much higher costs.Still, the plan for a second lunar lander hinges on Congress providing money to pay for it. Mr. Nelson said he would not discuss how much the program may cost until the president’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2023 is released early next week.ImageAn artist’s concept of a SpaceX Starship spacecraft at the moon.Credit...SpaceXAfter SpaceX was named the only winner last year, the two companies that lost — Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon; and Dynetics, a defense contractor — filed protests with the federal Government Accountability Office. Blue Origin’s proposal was twice the price of SpaceX’s and Dynetics’ proposal was even higher.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe G.A.O. ruled against both companies.Blue Origin then sued NASA in federal court. It again lost.Blue Origin and Dynetics now have a second chance, as do other companies that would like to submit proposals. Lisa Watson-Morgan, the manager for NASA’s human landing system program, said the agency planned to decide on a second lander by early next year.In a statement, Dynetics said the company was “pleased to learn of NASA’s plans,” and was looking forward to reviewing the upcoming call for proposals.Blue Origin also cheered the announcement. “Blue Origin is thrilled that NASA is creating competition by procuring a second human lunar landing system,” the company said in its statement. “Blue Origin is ready to compete and remains deeply committed to the success of Artemis.”The requirements for the second lander will be more ambitious — more cargo, longer stays on the surface — reflecting the desire for more ambitious missions on the moon.In addition, NASA would negotiate with SpaceX under its existing contract to build a lander meeting the new requirements, Ms. Watson-Morgan said.NASA’s journey to sending astronauts back to the moon has been long and winding, and the current 2025 target for adding new American footprints on the moon appears unrealistically optimistic.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyStill, NASA has been making progress.A giant rocket, the Space Launch System, is now finally at the launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, although it will just sit there for now. Next month, NASA will conduct a dress rehearsal of a countdown — fueling the rocket but not igniting the engines. The rocket will then return to the Vehicle Assembly Building — essentially a huge tall garage for rockets — for final preparations of a crewless test launch called Artemis 1 that could occur as early as this summer. It would send a capsule, Orion, around the moon and back to Earth.The second Artemis mission will be the first with astronauts riding inside the Orion crew capsule at the top of the S.L.S. rocket. That flight, which is penciled in for May 2024, would enter orbit around the moon before returning to Earth.The first moon landing would occur no earlier than 2025, during Artemis 3. Four astronauts would again take an Orion capsule to lunar orbit where they would dock with the SpaceX Starship spacecraft, which will be there waiting for them. Two of the astronauts — the first woman and the first person of color, NASA says — would move to Starship and then land near the moon’s south pole and stay on the surface for about a week.SpaceX has launched a series of Starship prototypes from its site in South Texas to an altitude of about six miles to show how it would belly flop after re-entering the atmosphere to slow down and then land vertically. In May, after four failed attempts, one of the prototypes landed successfully. SpaceX is aiming to launch the first orbital flight of a Starship in the coming months.The goal of returning astronauts to the moon was revived during the Trump administration. NASA officials then, and now under the Biden administration, have insisted that the objective this time is not itself the end but the beginning of larger human explorations of the moon, and eventually farther out into the solar system.With Wednesday’s announcement, NASA is trying to turn that hope into a continuing program.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/25/science/25nasa-print1/23nasa1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

Sleep across the animal kingdom manifests itself in many peculiar ways, like the birds whose brains sleep one half at a time or the bats that spend almost every hour of their day snoozing.And in a paper published in Current Biology on Wednesday, researchers confirmed that the draughtsboard shark, a small nocturnal shark native to New Zealand, appears to be sleeping during periods of calm, reporting that their metabolism and posture change significantly during these bouts of repose.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/09/science/09tb-sleepingsharks1/09tb-sleepingsharks1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

To kill its prey, a boa will coil around it, squeezing hard enough to stop the prey’s blood from flowing, and then, stretching its jaws open, devour it whole. They are known to eat opossums and rats. Some of their larger relatives, anacondas, can eat capybara and deer, and there have been some instances of pythons eating people.But constricting and ingesting prey is no small — or quick — feat. “They do this for 10, 15, up to 45 minutes,” said Elizabeth Brainerd, an evolutionary biologist at Brown University. “And that takes quite a bit of energy, so they have to be breathing.”Dr. Brainerd and her colleagues set out to understand how boa constrictors breathe under such cramped conditions and discovered that they’re able to precisely shift the region of their rib cage that expands to draw air into their lungs. Their work was published on Thursday in the Journal of Experimental Biology. Their findings shed light on the anatomy of snakes and how these slithering predators have come to thrive in so many parts of the world.“Large prey ingestion really opened up all these new avenues for snakes to evolve that otherwise would not have been possible,” said John Capano, an evolutionary biologist at Brown University and an author of the study.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyLooking out across the tree of vertebrate life shows that taking in and releasing air is more complex than it seems.“Breathing is one of those things that seems super simple,” said Allison Hsiang, a computational paleobiologist at Stockholm University who was not involved in the study. “But if we’re looking at all the major vertebrate groups, we basically all breathe using completely different systems.”ImageWhile squeezing, boa constrictors’ ribs are compressed, and ingesting the prey also expands their ribs to the limit.Credit...Wes Frazer for The New York TimesHumans, for instance, have a diaphragm, while birds use air sacs. But snakes are fully dependent on their rib cage and, in addition, have large, long physiques that sit behind a comparatively minuscule head and require a lot of food to maintain.“Basically snakes are all ribs,” Dr. Brainerd said. To breathe, the animals slowly expand a section of their rib cage, which creates a pressure change that pulls air in.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhile they’re squeezing, those ribs are compressed. Ingesting prey also expands ribs to their limit. Exactly how boas could breathe while constricting or ingesting remained a mystery.“Something had to happen with the evolution of their lung ventilation system in order for them to become these elongated, small-headed animals that eat big meals,” Dr. Brainerd said.Based on previous observations in the field, scientists had theorized that, when constricting and ingesting prey, snakes are most likely changing the specific region of their rib cage that’s expanding. But another option would be that they use any uncompressed area of their rib cage to draw air into their lungs.To test these hypotheses, the research group visualized a boa constrictor’s rib cage during constriction using 3-D X-ray technology. With the snakes anesthetized, the team implanted metal markers no bigger than half a millimeter in the ribs and vertebrae they wanted to image. Then they filmed these regions with X-ray video and, using a blood pressure cuff, restricted rib motion in specific regions, simulating what happens in nature when these snakes constrict their prey.When resting, boa constrictors breathe using ribs near the upper third of their lungs. But when the blood pressure cuff was wrapped around those ribs, a specific set of ribs further down the snake’s body began expanding to draw in air. “The snake just turns off a section of the rib cage and then turns on another section,” said Dr. Capano, who added that as soon as the cuff was removed, the ribs used to breathe during rest immediately re-engaged.The team believes that this ability to modulate rib engagement emerged while or before snakes evolved the ability to constrict, and perhaps ahead of a snake’s ability to eat large prey. Without this breathing adaptation, they say, snakes may not have become such a diverse class of reptiles spread out across the globe.","null"

It May Depend on Their Age.","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/science/social-media-teens-mental-health.html","Does Social Media Make Teens Unhappy? It May Depend on Their Age.","March 28, 2022","Virginia Hughes","Over the past few years, as the cold glow of a smartphone has followed more and more adolescents from bedroom to school and back again, parents have fretted over the technology’s influence. And no wonder, with Facebook researchers covertly studying how its apps erode girls’ body image, doctors describing TikTok-induced tic disorders, and prosecutors and lawmakers pledging to hold social media companies responsible for harming children.But in the background, a quieter scientific discussion has questioned whether social media is doing much harm at all. While a few researchers have claimed that digital technology is a powerful, causal factor in the rising rates of mental health problems, others have countered that the risk of harm for most teenagers is tiny — about the equivalent influence on well-being as wearing eyeglasses or regularly eating potatoes, one group calculated.Now, the authors of the eyeglass paper have published a large, multiyear study providing what independent experts said was an unusually granular and rigorous look at the relationship between social media and adolescents’ feelings about life.Analyzing survey responses of more than 84,000 people of all ages in Britain, the researchers identified two distinct periods of adolescence when heavy use of social media spurred lower ratings of “life satisfaction”: first around puberty — ages 11 to 13 for girls, and 14 to 15 for boys — and then again for both sexes around age 19.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyLike many previous studies, this one found that the relationship between social media and an adolescent’s well-being was fairly weak. Still, it suggested that there were certain periods in development when teenagers may be most sensitive to the technology.“We actually considered that the links between social media and well-being might be different across different ages — and found that that is indeed the case,” said Amy Orben, an experimental psychologist at Cambridge University, who led the study.For most adolescents in the United States, screens are a big part of life. Nine out of 10 American teenagers have a smartphone, and they are spending many hours a day staring at it — watching videos, playing games and communicating through social media, recent surveys show.As social media use among teenagers has exploded over the past two decades, so too have rates of depression, anxiety and suicide, leading scientists to wonder if these striking trends could be related.Some have suggested that social media may have an indirect effect on happiness by displacing other activities, like in-person interactions, exercise or sleep, that are crucial for mental and physical health. Heavy social-media use seems to disturb adolescent sleep patterns, for example.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyStill, research looking for a direct relationship between social media and well-being has not found much.“There’s been absolutely hundreds of these studies, almost all showing pretty small effects,” said Jeff Hancock, a behavioral psychologist at Stanford University who has conducted a meta-analysis of 226 such studies.What is notable about the new study, said Dr. Hancock, who was not involved in the work, is its scope. It included two surveys in Britain totaling 84,000 people. One of those surveys followed more than 17,000 adolescents ages 10 to 21 over time, showing how their social media consumption and life-satisfaction ratings changed from one year to the next.“Just in terms of scale, it’s fantastic,” Dr. Hancock said. The rich age-based analysis, he added, is a major improvement over previous studies, which tended to lump all adolescents together. “The adolescent years are not like some constant period of developmental life — they bring rapid changes,” he said.The study found that during early adolescence, heavy use of social media predicted lower life-satisfaction ratings one year later. For girls, this sensitive period was between ages 11 and 13, whereas for boys it was 14 and 15. Dr. Orben said that this sex difference could simply be because girls tend to hit puberty earlier than boys do.“We know that adolescent girls go through a lot of development earlier than boys do,” Dr. Orben said. “There are a lot of things that could be potential drivers, whether they’re social, cognitive or biological.”Both the boys and girls in the study hit a second period of social media sensitivity around age 19. “That was quite surprising because it was so consistent across the sexes,” Dr. Orben said. Around that age, she said, many people go through major social upheaval — like starting college, working in a new job or living independently for the first time — that might change the way they interact with social media, she said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAlthough the new report drew from richer data sets than previous studies did, it nevertheless lacked some information that would be helpful in interpreting the results, experts said. Waiting a whole year between responses is not ideal, for example. And although the surveys asked how much time the participants spent communicating on social media, they did not ask how they used it; talking to strangers while simultaneously playing a video game might lead to different effects than texting with a group of friends from school.Taken together with past work, the findings suggest that while most teenagers are not affected much by social media, a small subset could be significantly harmed by its effects. But it is impossible to predict the risks for an individual child.“For your 12-year-old, what does that mean for them? It’s hard to know,” said Michaeline Jensen, a clinical psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Given the small effect seen in the study, “very few of these kids would be going from normal functioning to clinical levels of depression,” she said. But “that’s not to say that none of them would.”Dr. Jensen pointed out that the study also found a link in the opposite direction: For all ages, participants who felt bad about their lives wound up spending more time on social media a year later. This suggests that for some people the technology may be a coping mechanism rather than the cause of their gloom.All these experts said that they were often frustrated by the public debates about social media and children, which so often inflate the platforms’ harms and ignore the benefits.“It carries risks — peer influence, contagion, substance use,” Dr. Jensen said. “But it can also carry lots of positive things,” like support, connection, creativity and skill mastery, she added. “I think a lot of times that does get overlooked because we’re so focused on risks.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/science/28ALTsocialmedia-print/28socialmedia-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

But unlike other protesters, some of whom had always been anti-establishment, Ms. Yamin had spent most of her life not only believing in the system but working at its top levels.“My life and my work is a dance between an insider and an outsider,” she said.Her experience as an insider goes back more than 30 years. Ms. Yamin, 57, is an internationally recognized environmental lawyer and a respected adviser to developing countries and small island nations like the Marshall Islands, working on their behalf at the international level.She is also a leading author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was a key architect of the Paris climate agreement. Ms. Yamin is widely seen as responsible for securing, through behind-the-scenes diplomacy, a central element of the pact: The goal of net-zero emissions by midcentury.After the agreement, though, as Donald J. Trump rose to power in the United States and other countries continually delayed strong action on climate change, she said her faith in institutions began to crumble.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“I was naïve about what we could achieve,” Ms. Yasmin said of her intellectual journey. “I’ve learned we cannot rely on lawyers and diplomats alone.”That journey started when Ms. Yamin was studying law in her 20s. Growing up as a Pakistani immigrant in England who experienced racism, Ms. Yamin knew she wanted to spend her career fighting injustice. When she embarked on an internship with a small environmental law firm in 1991 as a recent Oxford graduate, Ms. Yamin knew she had found her calling. “I never looked back,” she said. “I was optimistic.”Since then, Ms. Yamin has attended nearly every major international climate conference, but she is best known for her work at the negotiations that led to the Paris Agreement.Climate Forward  There’s an ongoing crisis — and tons of news. Our newsletter keeps you up to date. Get it sent to your inbox.She had spent years working with academics, civil society groups and lawyers to make net-zero emissions — the idea of using reductions, carbon capture and carbon offsets to ensure that no additional greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere — the rallying call of the 2015 conference. “Farhana was among a handful of collaborators who was willing to step up and champion this quest,” said Bernice Lee, a research director on sustainability at Chatham House, a London research organization.But just months after Ms. Yamin achieved one of the biggest victories of her career, she said, things took a turn for the worse. By 2016, some Western countries were seeing a rise of nationalism and a growing distrust of international institutions, with Britain voting to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump threatening to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement if elected.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“I felt that the whole multilateral world, the international framework for human rights, was just collapsing around me,” Ms. Yamin said.When, from a meeting room at a United Nations climate conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, Ms. Yamin watched Mr. Trump win the election, she was despondent. She felt that her 30-year career as a government lawyer and climate negotiator had amounted to nothing.“All of it was going up in smoke,” she said. “I couldn’t tell my clients, I couldn’t lie to the Marshall Islands, that we would fix this.” Ms. Yamin took a year off, spending most of her time in nature therapy classes and camping in the wilderness for weeks at a time.During her time off, Ms. Yamin began reading about other social movements, like the anti-apartheid campaign and the suffragist movement, that used social mobilization and nonviolent resistance to advance their causes. “I felt that the climate movement was almost unique and fragile, relying mostly on insider tactics and not on movement building,” she said. “It wasn’t relying on the full sets of tools.”It was this idea that reignited Ms. Yamin’s passion for climate and helped her get back to work. Instead of returning to climate diplomacy, Ms. Yamin joined the nascent Extinction Rebellion movement, a decentralized group that uses nonviolent action and civil disobedience, in 2018.Initially, Ms. Yamin became the leader of Extinction Rebellion’s political team, using her knowledge of the diplomatic terrain to help the movement be more strategic in its activism and get more funding. Even in her new activist role, though, Ms. Yamin felt she was relying too heavily on her intellectual skills instead of putting her body on the line. When an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was issued in October 2018, Ms. Yamin was reading the report as activists filled Parliament Square in London. As she saw pictures of young people refusing to move and waiting to be arrested, she thought, “I want to be with them.”Understand the Latest News on Climate ChangeCard 1 of 4Ice shelf collapses.

Nearly 60 percent of the continental United States is experiencing drought.Ms. Yamin spent the following two years working with Extinction Rebellion, organizing and protesting alongside other activists. She stepped down from her role with the group in 2020 because of disagreements with other leaders. Ms. Yamin said she believed the movement was not focused enough on climate justice.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySince then, Ms. Yamin has been charting a new path, one that does not depend on institutions or activist groups.At COP26, the latest United Nations climate summit, held last year in Glasgow, Ms. Yamin worked as hard as she always has at these events, eager to defend the legacy of Paris. But rather than spend her days in the negotiating room, surrounded by what she calls a “toxic positivity,” Ms. Yamin focused on movement-building and listening to vulnerable people who spoke outside the conference center.She said she left Glasgow heartbroken, both by the outcome of the conference and the stories she heard from marginalized communities about climate impacts. “I could almost cry. We keep pushing the deadlines out,” she said. “At what point do we say, ‘Enough?’”For her next chapter, Ms. Yamin said she wants to work directly with frontline communities of color in Britain and help to mobilize the cultural sector to become more engaged in climate issues.“We need the cultural sector and the creatives to help us imagine our way out of the crisis,” she said. She also wants to educate philanthropic organizations on climate justice to help get more money to frontline communities. Her goal is to make sure every pocket of society is fighting the climate crisis. “Everyone should have ‘activist’ on their C.V.,” she said.When asked how she feels looking back at her career, Ms. Yamin paused. “I’m proud of my achievements,” she said. “But I can’t keep carrying on doing that in the face of known indifference.”She added, “I’m much more honest now.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/17/science/00cli-yamin-profile/00cli-yamin-profile-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

That is more than six times as much as the latest estimate from the Environmental Protection Agency.The number came as a surprise to Yuanlei Chen and Evan Sherwin, the lead authors of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.“We spent really the past more than two years going backwards and forwards thinking of ways that we might be wrong and talking with other experts in the methane community,” said Dr. Sherwin, a postdoctoral research fellow in energy resources engineering at Stanford. “And at the end of that process, we realized that this was our best estimate of methane emissions in this region and this time, and we had to publish it.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHe and Ms. Chen, a Ph.D. student in energy resources engineering, said they believed their results showed the necessity of surveying a large number of sites in order to accurately measure the environmental impact of oil and gas production.Climate Fwd  There’s an ongoing crisis — and tons of news. Our newsletter keeps you up to date. Get it sent to your inbox.The largest previous assessment of methane emissions from oil and gas in the United States, published in 2018, reviewed studies covering about 1,000 well sites, a tiny fraction of the more than one million active wells in the country. The new study, by contrast, used aerial data to examine nearly 27,000 sites from above: more than 90 percent of all wells in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin, which also extends into Texas.The researchers also took measurements from each site on multiple occasions to account for the fact that operations, and therefore emissions, vary over time. Methane can be released by wells both on purpose, in a process known as venting, and through unintentional leaks from aging or faulty equipment.They found that a small number of wells and pipelines accounted for “the vast majority” of methane leaks, Ms. Chen said, adding, “Comprehensive point source surveys find more high-consequence emission events, which drive total emissions.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyRobert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University who was not involved in the study, called it “very carefully done.” Dr. Howarth has long argued that the E.P.A. substantially underestimates the methane problem. The new study calculated methane emissions at 9.4 percent of gross gas production, which dwarfs the Environmental Protection Agency’s 1.4 percent estimate.Natural gas accounts for about a third of American energy consumption, and because it is less costly than coal in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, many policymakers have promoted it as a “bridge” that could do less damage to the climate while society works on a longer-term transition to renewable energy. But compared to coal, natural gas results in much higher emissions of methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but doesn’t last as long in the atmosphere.Understand the Latest News on Climate ChangeCard 1 of 4Ice shelf collapses.

Drought conditions are likely to continue across more than half of the continental United States through at least June, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Nearly 60 percent of the continental United States is experiencing drought.Ramón Alvarez, an atmospheric chemist at the Environmental Defense Fund, estimated about a decade ago that the break-even point — the point above which natural gas would actually hurt the climate more than coal — was a 3.1 percent methane leakage rate. Based on more recent data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Dr. Howarth estimates that the threshold is closer to 2.8 or 2.9 percent.That makes the 9.4 percent leakage rate in the new study highly alarming, experts said, though they emphasized that the rate in the Permian Basin might not be comparable to rates elsewhere.“If this result is similar in other basins — which we don’t know if it is — that would eliminate the greenhouse gas emission savings of the coal-to-gas transition,” said Amy Townsend-Small, an associate professor of environmental science at the University of Cincinnati.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIf there was good news in the study, it was that a small number of oil and gas sites contributed disproportionately to emissions — suggesting that, if the worst offenders change their practices, it is possible for the industry to operate more cleanly.A rule finalized last year by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Commission bans regular venting and flaring, referring to the practice of releasing or burning off natural gas rather than containing it. Another regulation being considered by the state’s Environmental Improvement Board would require more frequent inspections and repairs of oil and gas infrastructure. (That measure is designed to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, a group of chemicals that can have adverse health effects, but oil and gas sites that leak V.O.C.s tend to also leak methane.)The Stanford researchers emphasized that the same methodology they used to quantify methane emissions could be used to identify problem sites and target regulations accordingly.“Aerial technology found high methane emissions,” Ms. Chen said, “but can also help fix them cost effectively.”","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/24/climate/24cli-methane/24cli-methane-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"

It’s present wherever mirror images are repeated, like in the right and left halves of elephants or butterflies, or in the repeating patterns of flower petals and starfish arms around a central point. It’s even hiding in the structures of tiny things like proteins and RNA. While asymmetry certainly exists in nature (like how your heart is off to one side in your chest, or how male fiddler crabs have one enlarged claw), symmetrical forms crop up too often in living things to just be random.Why does symmetry reign supreme? Biologists aren’t sure — there’s no reason based in natural selection for symmetry’s prevalence in such varied forms of life and their building blocks. Now it seems like a good answer could come from the field of computer science.In a paper published this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers analyzed thousands of protein complexes and RNA structures as well as a model network of molecules that control how genes switch on and off. They found that evolution tends toward symmetry because the instructions to produce symmetry are easier to embed in genetic code and follow. Symmetry is maybe the most fundamental application of the adage “work smarter, not harder.”“People often are quite amazed that evolution can make these incredible structures, and what we’re showing is that it’s actually easier than you might think,” said Ard Louis, a physicist at the University of Oxford and an author of the study.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“It’s like we found a new law of nature,” said Chico Camargo, a co-author and a lecturer in computer science at the University of Exeter in England. “This is beautiful, because it changes how you see the world.”Dr. Louis, Dr. Camargo and their colleague Iain Johnston began their exploration of symmetry’s evolutionary origins when Dr. Johnston was working on his Ph.D., running simulations to understand how viruses form their protein shells. The structures that emerged were highly biased toward symmetry, cropping up far more often than pure randomness would allow.The researchers were surprised at first, but it made sense — the algorithms to produce simple, repeating patterns are easier to carry out and harder to screw up. Dr. Johnston, now at the University of Bergen in Norway, likens it to telling someone how to tile a floor: It’s easier to give instructions to lay down repeating rows of identical square tiles than explain how to make a complex mosaic.Over the next decade, the researchers and their team applied that same concept to basic biological components, looking at how proteins assemble into clusters and how RNA folds.“The shapes that appear more often are the simpler ones, or the ones that are less crazy,” Dr. Camargo said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImagining RNA and proteins as little input-output machines that carry out algorithmic genetic instructions explains the tendency toward symmetry in a way that Darwinian “survival of the fittest” hasn’t been able to. Because it’s easier to encode instructions for building simple, symmetrical structures, nature winds up with a disproportionate number of these simpler instruction sets to choose from when it comes to natural selection. That makes evolution a bit like a “biased game with loaded dice,” Dr. Camargo said, producing disproportionate symmetry because of its simplicity.While their paper focuses on microscopic structures, the researchers believe that this logic extends to bigger, more complex organisms. “It would make an awful lot of sense if nature could reuse the program to produce a petal rather than have a different program for every one of the 100 petals around the sunflower,” Dr. Johnston said.While there’s still a gulf between demonstrating the statistical bias toward microscopic symmetry and explaining the symmetry we see in plants and animals, Holló Gábor, a biologist who studies symmetry at the University of Debrecen in Hungary, says he’s excited by the results of the new paper. “To explain how such an inherent and such a universal feature emerges at all in evolution, in nature, that’s something,” said Dr. Holló, who was not involved with the study.Similarly, Luís Seoane, a complex systems researcher at the Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia in Spain, also not involved in the study, praised the work as being “as legit as it gets.”“There is a war going on between simplicity and complexity, and we live right at the edge of it,” Dr. Seoane said. The universe tends toward ever-increasing randomness, he added, but these simple, symmetrical building blocks help make sense of that complexity.","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/science/24tb-symmetry/24tb-symmetry-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"
