Last week, he took them out.“We cannot continue in our global family, as much as we love it,” Mr. Crist told his congregation in an emotional sermon on Sunday, citing, among other reasons, the recent resignation of Hillsong’s global leader under a haze of scandal. “I am heartbroken.”In the last two weeks, Hillsong has lost nine of its 16 American church campuses, a swift and stunning decline for one of the world’s largest and most influential evangelical churches.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyJust a few years ago, Hillsong was the leading edge of cool Christianity, a quickly expanding network that appealed to young people and city dwellers with energetic, stylish preachers and an upbeat atmosphere. Hillsong translated the charismatic church experience, which emphasizes miracles and personal encounters with the Holy Spirit, for a hip, upscale audience.Justin Bieber and the N.B.A. star Kevin Durant attended services; one of the church’s worship bands won a Grammy Award and the church produced soaring anthems that became staples in smaller churches that imitated its sounds, style, and Instagram-friendly aesthetic.Now, Hillsong’s U.S. presence is in collapse. Its remaining U.S. locations are in the Northeast and in California, meaning Hillsong no longer has a major presence between the coasts.The departures are partly the fallout from a series of crises — most recently the sudden resignation of its charismatic founder — that have left the church with a tarnished reputation and instability that pastors say they found increasingly difficult to endure.“I can’t think of a church in the English-speaking Western world with as broad a global reach as Hillsong,” said Ed Stetzer, the executive director of the Wheaton College Billy Graham Center in Illinois. The current upheaval at the church “is a very big deal and will have ramifications not just for Hillsong, but for contemporary evangelism around the world,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe church was already grappling with in-house tensions and a damaged brand when its Australian founder and global leader, Brian Houston, resigned on March 23 after an internal investigation found that he behaved inappropriately toward two women. Mr. Houston had stepped away from all ministry duties in January, explaining that he needed to concentrate on fighting a criminal charge of concealing child sexual abuse committed by his late father, who was also a pastor.ImageBrian Houston, the church’s founder, resigned in March after the church said an internal investigation found he behaved inappropriately toward two women.Credit...Jeff Gilbert/ShutterstockThe church’s investigation found that Mr. Houston sent “inappropriate text messages” to one staff member, and that several years later he spent time alone in a hotel room with a woman who attended the church’s annual conference in Sydney. In a statement to The New York Times, the press office for the church said there have been no other complaints about Mr. Houston’s behavior.The church has blamed medication and alcohol for Mr. Houston’s actions. Mr. Houston has not publicly commented on his resignation. He could not be immediately reached for comment.Phil Dooley, the church’s interim global leader, responded to some questions in an email through the church press office. In the email, Mr. Dooley said Mr. Houston’s resignation came as “a tremendous surprise to many members of our community.”  The church press office did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Houston would receive a severance package or any future financial compensation from the church. The press office also declined to say whether Mr. Houston’s wife, Bobbie, whose title was also Global Senior Pastor, remained employed by the church.On Thursday, a day after Mr. Houston’s resignation, the streaming service Discovery+ released a three-part documentary, “Hillsong: A Megachurch Exposed.” The documentary depicts the megachurch as a toxic institution obsessed with image, control and growth at all costs. It features interviews with critics, former employees and members, and a woman who has said she had a monthslong affair with Carl Lentz, at the time the celebrity lead pastor of Hillsong’s East Coast branches. The press office for the church said in an emailed statement that the documentary’s portrait of Hillsong is “almost unrecognizable” to the church community.Mr. Dooley, the interim leader, said in an email to The Times through the church press office that he has been “talking with members of our team around the world in what seems like a nonstop conversation” since the revelations of Mr. Houston’s behavior. He described the crisis as a challenging and emotional time for both members and leaders. “This difficult season has sparked conversations that we should have been having as a church for a very long time,” he said. He said the church is reviewing its policies and procedures to “provide both health and accountability for leaders.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHillsong exercises some control over the financial operations of each member church, though congregations set their own budgets. Churches also pass on 5 percent of the contributions they receive to the global church. In return, they receive organizational and teaching resources, and what was at one time a straightforwardly valuable association with one of the most recognizable evangelical churches in the world.For some leaders of local Hillsong branches, the baggage has become too burdensome to be worth the benefits of affiliation.Last week, the lead pastor of Hillsong Atlanta, Sam Collier, emailed his church to inform them that he was withdrawing his church from Hillsong in the wake of “consistent media attacks, slander, and accusations” against Hillsong — some of which, he acknowledged, were true.“All the challenges and the speculation and the scandal and the articles and all of the above, it got to a point where the people in our church just did not want to deal with it anymore,” Mr. Collier said in an interview. His hiring as Hillsong’s first Black lead pastor was announced about a week before the news of Mr. Lentz’s misconduct became public in 2020, meaning his entire tenure at the church has been clouded by scandal emanating from Hillsong entities far from Atlanta.Sunday’s service was the last for Hillsong Atlanta. “We believe the Lord is calling us to move into the next season,” Mr. Collier told his congregation. Mr. Collier is launching a new church on Easter Sunday, and expects much of his Hillsong congregation to migrate there. The press office for Hillsong said there were no plans to reestablish Hillsong Atlanta.Another branch, Hillsong Kansas City, which launched in 2019, quietly separated from Hillsong about two weeks ago and relaunched as Kingdom City Church. The press office for the global church said the two parties “made a mutual decision to separate” before Mr. Houston’s departure. A person who answered the phone at Kingdom City last week said the church had no comment.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHillsong’s website says 150,000 people attend services weekly in 30 countries, but that estimate was taken before the pandemic. The press office said an accurate attendance count is not possible because of pandemic restrictions in some countries, and emphasized the church’s longtime focus, heightened during the pandemic, on online participation.ImageWorshippers at the last Hillsong service in Atlanta Sunday. Hillsong drew crowds with its upbeat approach to worship and soaring musical performances.Credit...Alyssa Pointer for The New York TimesMr. Houston and his wife, Bobbie, are towering figures in Australia. The church grew for decades as part of the Australian branch of the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination. The church offered original music with high production values — sometimes performed in actual concert venues. Mr. Houston once instructed pastors in Australia that a Hillsong sermon “leaves people feeling better about themselves than they came.” Pentecostalism, a charismatic movement, often features practices like speaking in tongues and faith healing. Hillsong took a more accessible approach. Always attuned to mass appeal, the church accentuated personal encounters with God, often through music. Hillsong became its own denomination in 2018.In 2020, the church’s relationship with money, sex, and celebrity came under renewed scrutiny when Mr. Houston fired Mr. Lentz for “leadership issues and breaches of trust, plus a recent revelation of moral failures.” Mr. Lentz, a one-time mentor of Mr. Bieber and a celebrity in his own right, confessed that he had been unfaithful to his wife and withdrew from public life.For Mr. Crist, leaving Hillsong was the culmination of several years of doubts about the institution. He objected a few years ago, he said, when a global church restructuring disbanded his board of local leaders and put him directly under the authority of the Australia-based global board.  And he bristled when he and other lead pastors were asked to sign noncompete and non-disparagement agreements in the wake of the scandal in the East Coast branches. He never signed.The church press office described the agreements as standard elements of their general contracts with church leaders.“This decision wasn’t arrived at lightly, and it was made calculating the significant cost,” Mr. Crist said in an interview, mentioning the possibility for disillusionment and pain. But “anyone who has been victimized in our church needs to be seen and heard.”Mr. Crist expects to begin holding services June 1 under a new name to be determined.In his sermon on Sunday, Mr. Crist called for an internal investigation into Hillsong’s global board, to make the findings of that investigation public, and to purge any board members “who have protected the institution and not the people.”"

The state last month released a long-term plan for living with the coronavirus, instead of treating it as an emergency.But at the same time, thousands of Californians continue to contract Covid-19 daily, while concerns grow that a new wave could be coming to the United States.If it seems particularly difficult to assess Covid dangers right now, that’s because it is.California has entered a new phase of the pandemic, in which its residents have more responsibility for deciding on safety precautions than ever before. And unfortunately, humans are not very good at understanding risk.Our perceptions are influenced by news coverage, policies, our personal experiences, the behaviors of people around us and so much more. Sometimes, or perhaps even often, our judgment is wildly off.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyTake this Stanford study. In May 2020, the average American believed the risk of catching the coronavirus while grocery shopping was 40 percent, and 62 percent when on public transportation, the researchers found.At that time, the fraction of Americans who had ever tested positive for the coronavirus was less than 1 percent.“We found that people drastically overestimated the risk,” said Maria Polyakova, one of the study’s authors and an assistant professor of health policy at Stanford. “People are really not good at understanding small risks.”Add to that the fact that the risk of severe Covid varies from person to person, and that the prevalence of the virus differs across communities and changes constantly, and the calculation becomes extremely complicated. There’s no universal answer.Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at U.C.L.A., said she worried that there was another, new factor at play too: pandemic fatigue. She has been tracking a highly transmissible coronavirus subvariant that’s fueling a surge in Europe and becoming increasingly common here.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Everybody is ready for Covid to be over,” Rimoin told me. “It’s like a kid in the back seat of a car saying, ‘Are we there yet? Are we there yet?’ We’re not there yet.”But it can be difficult to translate those small risks into behavioral changes, experts say.The decisions we make — Will I fly to that wedding? Should I eat at an indoor restaurant? — tend to be yes-or-no choices, not behaviors we can modify by, say, 10 percent, said Craig McKenzie, a psychology professor at U.C. San Diego.So we’re all searching for a threshold at which we can stop adjusting our behaviors to avoid Covid, he said. And some people may already feel they have reached that place.“Flu is a risk, flying is a risk, driving is a risk — we can’t attend to all of them,” he told me. “At some point I have to act as if this doesn’t matter because, if the risk is one in a million, should I change my behavior?”For more:A C.D.C. map shows Covid risk levels in each county in California.

Election BillAs Republicans rush to pass a second round of new voting and election rules, a bipartisan group of election officials is fighting back.By Maya King and Nick Corasaniti","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/georgia-election-bill.html","Local Election Officials in Georgia Oppose G.O.P. Election Bill","Published March 28, 2022Updated March 29, 2022, 12:28 a.m. ET","Maya King","ATLANTA — A year ago, when Georgia Republicans passed a mammoth law of election measures and voting restrictions, many local election officials felt frustrated and sidelined, as their concerns about resources, ballot access and implementation went largely ignored.This year, Republicans have returned with a new bill — and the election officials are pushing back.A bipartisan coalition of county-level election administrators — the people who carry out the day-to-day work of running elections — is speaking out against the latest Republican measure. At a legislative hearing on Monday, they warned that the proposal would create additional burdens on a dwindling force of election workers and that the provisions could lead to more voter intimidation.“You’re going to waste time, and you’re going to cause me to lose poll workers,” said Joel Natt, a Republican member of the Forsyth County board of elections, referring to a provision in the bill that he said would force workers to count hundreds of blank sheets of paper. “I have 400 poll workers that work for our board. That is 400 people that I could see telling me after May, ‘Have a nice life,’ and it’s hard enough to keep them right now.”Among other provisions, the bill would expand the reach of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation over election crimes; limit private funding of elections; empower partisan poll watchers; and establish new requirements for tracking absentee ballots as they are verified and counted.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe bill passed the Georgia House this month, roughly two weeks after it was first introduced. Initially, the State Senate appeared set to pass the measure at a similar speed. The state’s legislative session ends on April 4, giving lawmakers less than a week to pass the bill.But county-level election officials worked behind the scenes, in letters and phone calls to legislators, expressing their concerns about the bill and dissatisfaction that they had not been consulted in the drafting process.The pushback comes as the impact of the wave of election laws passed by Republicans last year is beginning to be felt. In Texas, where a new law altered the absentee ballot process, election officials dealt with widespread confusion among absentee voters in the March primary. Mail ballot rejections surged, and county officials worked around the clock to help voters fix their ballots. Still, more than 18,000 voters had their ballots tossed out.The vocal opposition from Georgia election officials represents a shift from a year ago, when some individual officials, mostly Democrats, spoke out against the first Republican bill. But many local officials simply felt ignored by lawmakers who were eager to appear to be addressing Republican voters’ false beliefs about fraud in the 2020 election.The statewide association of local election officials is now working to “start taking stances on legislation like this, where the association would have a view that represents a majority of our members,” said Joseph Kirk, the elections supervisor for Bartow County, which is deeply Republican, who serves as a secretary for the association. He added that the group had not taken a stance on the election bill but that many members were voicing their opinions individually.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAt a conference this month, Ryan Germany, general counsel for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, encouraged members to speak up.“They really need to know what you guys think about this stuff because they hear from a lot of people, but I don’t think they hear from a lot of election officials,” said Mr. Germany, who spoke favorably about several provisions in the bill, according to audio of the event obtained by The New York Times.Dozens of voting rights advocates and county election officials crowded the State Senate Ethics Committee hearing on Monday afternoon, saying the bill would make it harder for election administrators to do their jobs.ImageFrom left, State Senators Sally Harrell, Butch Miller and Jeff Mullis listened as Cindy Battles, right, testified during the hearing on Monday. Credit...Nicole Craine for The New York Times“There are so many unfunded mandates being passed by this body. You are not giving county election officials the budget that they need to run their elections,” said Cindy Battles, the policy and engagement director at the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda, a civil rights group. “And then you are making it more difficult to get what they need.”Several officials pointed to a provision that would require elections administrators to account for all elections-related documents, including the pieces of paper that ballots are printed on. Mr. Natt, the vice chair of elections for Forsyth County’s board of elections, held up a ream of paper to represent one of the hundreds of blank sheets of paper that his office would need to count under the law.“That is a lot of counting. That is a lot of time and waste management,” he said.State Representative James Burchett, a Republican from southeastern Georgia and sponsor of the bill, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution this month that “the intent of the bill is to address issues that we’ve seen in the elections process.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDuring the hearing on Monday, State Senator Butch Miller, a Republican and member of the State Senate Ethics Committee, appeared to consider some of the officials’ concerns.“I think we’ll probably have additional work to be done,” he said. While Mr. Miller said he was not interested in sweeping changes to the bill, he also said he was not opposed to “tweaking them and accommodating certain issues.” The committee has not yet scheduled a vote on the bill.Election officials warned about language they considered too broad in a provision that restricts third-party donations to election offices. The proposal is popular among Republicans who believe grants from an organization tied to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, had undue influence in the 2020 election. Some Georgia election officials said the legislation would require any organization that makes a donation to receive approval from the state board of elections. That could include churches or other local groups that offer their buildings as polling locations.“By a strict interpretation of this particular provision, that would be a grant of gift or donation,” Milton Kidd, the elections director in Douglas County, a deeply Democratic county, said in an interview.Mr. Kidd added that many churches did not have staff to handle the application process, which could threaten his ability to maintain enough polling locations.Officials also took issue with a provision requiring partisan poll watchers to be given “meaningful access” to observe the ballot-counting process. The language might jeopardize the privacy of the ballot, they said.“I am a big fan of poll watchers, of being observed, I want my polling places to have observation, it’s a very important part of the process,” said Mr. Kirk, the administrator in Bartow County, which is northwest of Atlanta. “But it’s also very important to have guardrails on that observation, to keep it from becoming disruptive, to make sure a person’s information stays safe.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA provision that gives the Georgia Bureau of Investigation the power to subpoena election records for fraud investigations has also stirred opposition, mostly among Democratic local officials, who view it as both unnecessary — the secretary of state’s office currently handles election investigations — and intended to scare off voters.“That just smacks of voter intimidation,” said Dele Lowman Smith, the chair of the DeKalb County board of voter registration and elections. “And that’s a big concern.”"

Shear","WASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday stood by his comment that Vladimir V. Putin should not remain president of Russia, but he said it was an expression of his own horror over the invasion of Ukraine and not a change in American policy aimed at seeking to remove Mr. Putin from office.“I was expressing the moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it,” Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House, rejecting criticism from around the globe in the last two days about the potential diplomatic consequences of his words. The president said no one should have interpreted his comments as calling for Mr. Putin’s ouster.“It’s ridiculous,” he said of the questions about his speech in Warsaw on Saturday, when he said, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” On Monday, Mr. Biden said: “Nobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that.”The fallout over Mr. Biden’s words in Warsaw underscored the dilemma that he and the NATO allies face about how to condemn the war in Ukraine and pressure Russia without shutting down any relationship with Moscow that might help end the invasion.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe West will also have to decide whether Moscow would be allowed back into the global economy, whether to lift sanctions and how to resume diplomatic relations if Russia pulls back its forces.Mr. Biden’s remark drew some praise for its toughness and clarity but also warnings from lawmakers and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who said on Sunday that “I wouldn’t use this kind of words” when asked about Mr. Biden’s speech. Mr. Macron said he hoped to obtain a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine through diplomacy.Some critics said Mr. Biden’s declaration could make it more difficult to negotiate an end to the 5-week-old war, which has killed thousands in Ukraine and driven millions from their homes.Mr. Biden insisted on Monday that was not the case, although Mr. Putin has told Russians for years that he believes the United States and the C.I.A. are conspiring to remove him from power. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said that Mr. Biden’s statement “makes us worry” and that the Kremlin would “continue to closely monitor” the president’s remarks.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin has told Russians for years that he believes the United States and the C.I.A. are conspiring to remove him from power.Credit...Sputnik, via ReutersIn his speech in Warsaw, Mr. Biden tried to draw a distinction between Mr. Putin’s actions and those of the Russian people, who he said were not responsible for the atrocities being committed by the country’s military in Ukraine each day. He suggested that Russian controls on television and the internet had left the country’s citizens unaware of the truth.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Vladimir Putin’s aggression have cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it’s taking Russia back to the 19th century,” he said. Moments later, he proclaimed that “a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty” before declaring that Mr. Putin should go.The White House appeared to rapidly understand that Mr. Biden’s words could be seen as a reversal of the administration’s long-stated position that it was not seeking regime change in Russia. It took just minutes for officials to back away from Mr. Biden’s comments on Saturday evening. Reporters had just loaded buses after his speech when administration officials sent an email denying that the president was formally advocating Mr. Putin’s removal.On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told journalists in Jerusalem that “we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter.”On Monday, his first extended comments on the matter, Mr. Biden insisted his statement had been misinterpreted.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 7:01 a.m. ET5 hours ago5 hours agoTalks in Turkey focus on a possible cease-fire.The head of the U.N. nuclear agency arrives in Ukraine to address security at nuclear sites.A Russian attack leaves a gaping hole in a government building in Mykolaiv.“The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war or a nuclear war with Russia. That’s not part of it,” Mr. Biden said. “I was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man. It’s outrageous. It’s outrageous. It’s more an aspiration than anything. He shouldn’t be in power.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“People like this shouldn’t be ruling countries, but they do,” he said, adding, “But it doesn’t mean I can’t express my outrage.”Mr. Biden spoke as the violence in Ukraine continued to intensify, with Russian forces appearing determined to cement their territorial gains in the east. In just five weeks, the conflict has killed thousands of civilians, including women and children who have been the victims of intense Russian bombardment. Human rights advocates say more than 3.7 million Ukrainians have fled, creating one of the largest-ever refugee crises across Eastern Europe.The president’s remark on Saturday was not the first time an apparently off-the-cuff comment upended or overshadowed an otherwise tightly scripted White House message.During a news conference earlier on the trip, Mr. Biden said Russia’s use of chemical weapons “would trigger a response in kind,” seeming to suggest that NATO would respond with chemical weapons, which are banned by international law. Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, told reporters the next day that was not what the president meant, saying that the “United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period, under any circumstances.”In January, Mr. Biden created a similar flurry of speculation when he said that the response to a then-potential invasion of Ukraine would depend on whether “it’s a minor incursion.” Mr. Biden eventually corrected himself, saying, “If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.”ImageBefore his speech on Saturday, President Biden visited with refugees from Ukraine at a stadium in Warsaw.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesMr. Biden is no stranger to the nuances of public diplomacy, in which officials — especially heads of state — are careful to speak in very particular ways in an effort to avoid offending another leader or sending an unintended message about policy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAmerican presidents, for example, never refer to Taiwan as an independent nation for fear of provoking anger from the Chinese government. Similar care is taken when talking about the city of Jerusalem, the status of which remains a disputed part of discussions between Israel and the Palestinians.In 2016, when President Barack Obama delivered a eulogy at the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former Israeli president, a White House stenographer initially indicated that the remarks had been given in “Jerusalem, Israel.” After that created a minor flap, the remarks were amended to remove the reference to Israel.President Donald J. Trump repeatedly violated many of the diplomatic rules in what aides said was a deliberate attempt to shake up the way foreign policy was conducted. He called the leader of North Korea “Rocket Man,” formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and took steps to more formally deal with Taiwan in the final days of his administration.Since taking office, Mr. Biden has made it a priority to return to a more traditional form of diplomacy in which the United States seeks to work with adversaries like Russia even as the administration challenges actions by Mr. Putin that it finds objectionable.But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tested that approach. During the past several weeks, Mr. Biden has grown increasingly vocal in his condemnation of Mr. Putin, using more aggressive language as the Russian leader has escalated his attacks on Ukraine.A week ago, he called Mr. Putin “a war criminal” before the United States had officially made that determination. Before his speech on Saturday, Mr. Biden visited with refugees from Ukraine at a stadium in Warsaw and called Mr. Putin “a butcher” because of the deaths caused by shelling in Mariupol, a hard-hit city in the eastern part of the country.That kind of language has helped Mr. Biden unite American allies behind a coordinated set of responses to Mr. Putin’s aggression, including some of the most severe sanctions ever levied on a large, developed nation. The president’s condemnations have been echoed over the past several weeks by other world leaders.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut it remains a delicate balance as the administration tries not to provoke Mr. Putin into engaging in a broader conflict with NATO countries. Mr. Biden has said repeatedly that such engagements could lead to World War III.In his remarks to reporters on Monday, the president said it was his visit with the refugees just hours earlier that led to his comment about Mr. Putin not staying in power.“Half the children in Ukraine,” he said, apparently referring to the number of children who are estimated to have become refugees because of the war. “I had just come from being with those families.”"

The average cost of gas in the United States hit a record high on March 11 at $4.33 per gallon, according to AAA. Although that number has since declined to an average of $4.24 per gallon, it is still 18 percent higher than it was last month and 48 percent more than it was a year ago.Some states are using budget surpluses from federal pandemic aid and increased tax revenue to cover the cost of suspending gas taxes for the next several weeks or months. Others are also considering pausing fares for public transportation.On March 18, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland announced that the state would suspend its tax of 36.1 cents per gallon for gasoline, and its slightly higher tax for diesel fuel, for the next 30 days, a measure that will cost the state $100 million.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“As we continue to stand in solidarity against Russian aggression in Ukraine, and as Marylanders face the impact of surging inflation, with the average price of gas rapidly rising, this bipartisan action will provide some relief for the pain at the pump,” Mr. Hogan said as he signed the bill into law.That same day, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed a bill suspending the state’s gas tax until May 31. On March 24, Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut announced that his state would temporarily suspended the 25 cents per gallon excise tax — as well as fares needed to ride a public bus — from April 1 to June 30.Officials in other states are considering similar measures.In Ohio, where gas prices have risen 21 percent over the past month, Republican lawmakers are considering a gas tax cut that would cost up to $4 billion over the next five years.

Gavin Newsom proposed an $11 billion relief package that would pause the state’s gas tax and provide free public transportation to residents.The average price of gas in California is $5.91, one of the highest in the country, compared with $4.82 a month ago, according to AAA. Mr. Newsom said the state needed to respond because of the price spikes that he said stemmed from the actions of President Vladimir V.

Despite talk of Russia focusing on the east, fighting across multiple battlefronts, including in the southern city of Mariupol, suggested a more dynamic and volatile situation.Biden’s comments. During a speech in Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said that President Vladimir V. Putin “cannot remain in power,” sending U.S. officials scrambling to walk back the ad-lib. On Monday, Mr. Biden stood by his remark, but said it was a personal expression of his outrage.But while many officials have embraced this kind of legislation, some experts say that a temporary reprieve from state gas taxes is an ill-conceived fix that will only hurt Americans in the long run.The relief could provide a respite for drivers, and help lower shipping costs for foods, but the moves do not address other people or problems affected by inflation, they argue.“This is primarily concentrated on drivers, and therefore doesn’t provide broader relief from all of the inflation-induced price increase,” said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Center for State Tax Policy, part of the nonprofit Tax Foundation.Drivers could experience sticker shock once these temporary cuts end and prices revert to normal, he added.“Even though it will provide some relief at the pump, it’s ultimately a fairly gimmicky way of providing relief at a time when consumers are facing higher prices across the board,” Mr. Walczak said."

Schmidt and Luke Broadwater","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/us/politics/trump-tweet-jan-6.html","New Focus on How a Trump Tweet Incited Far-Right Groups Ahead of Jan. 6","March 29, 2022Updated 8:39 a.m. ET","Alan Feuer","Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators have gathered growing evidence of how a tweet by President Donald J. Trump less than three weeks before Jan. 6, 2021, served as a crucial call to action for extremist groups that played a central role in storming the Capitol.Mr. Trump’s Twitter post in the early hours of Dec. 19, 2020, was the first time he publicly urged supporters to come to Washington on the day Congress was scheduled to certify the Electoral College results showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the winner of the presidential vote. His message — which concluded with, “Be there, will be wild!” — has long been seen as instrumental in drawing the crowds that attended a pro-Trump rally on the Ellipse on Jan. 6 and then marched to the Capitol.But the Justice Department’s criminal investigation of the riot and the parallel inquiry by the House select committee have increasingly shown how Mr. Trump’s post was a powerful catalyst, particularly for far-right militants who believed he was facing his final chance to reverse defeat and whose role in fomenting the violence has come under intense scrutiny.Extremist groups almost immediately celebrated Mr. Trump’s Twitter message, which they widely interpreted as an invitation to descend on the city in force. Responding to the president’s words, the groups sprang into action, court filings and interviews by the House committee show: Extremists began to set up encrypted communications channels, acquire protective gear and, in one case, prepare heavily armed “quick reaction forces” to be staged outside Washington.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThey also began to whip up their members with a drumbeat of bellicose language, with their private messaging channels increasingly characterized by what one called an “apocalyptic tone.” Directly after Mr. Trump’s tweet was posted, the Capitol Police began to see a spike in right-wing threats against members of Congress.Prosecutors have included examples in at least five criminal cases of extremists reacting within days — often hours — to Mr. Trump’s post.ImageThe mob attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesOne of those who responded to the post was Guy Wesley Reffitt, an oil-field worker from Texas who this month became the first Jan. 6 defendant to be convicted at trial. Within a day of Mr. Trump’s Twitter post, Mr. Reffitt was talking about it on a private group chat with other members of the far-right militia organization the Texas Three Percenters.“Our President will need us. ALL OF US…!!! On January 6th,” Mr. Reffitt wrote. “We the People owe him that debt. He Sacrificed for us and we must pay that debt.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe next day, prosecutors say, Mr. Reffitt began to make arrangements to travel to Washington and arrive in time for “Armageddon all day” on Jan. 6, he wrote in the Three Percenters group chat. He told his compatriots that he planned to drive because flying was impossible with “all the battle rattle” he planned to bring — a reference to his weapons and body armor, prosecutors say.Some in the group appeared to share his anger. On Dec. 22, one member wrote in the chat, “The only way you will be able to do anything in DC is if you get the crowd to drag the traitors out.”Mr. Reffitt responded: “I don’t think anyone going to DC has any other agenda.”The House committee has also sharpened its focus on how the tweet set off a chain reaction that galvanized Mr. Trump’s supporters to begin military-style planning for Jan. 6. As part of the congressional inquiry, investigators are trying to establish whether there was any coordination beyond the post that ties Mr. Trump’s inner circle to the militants and whether the groups plotted together.“That tweet could be viewed as a call to action,” said Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California and a member of the committee. “It’s definitely something we’re asking questions about through our discussions with witnesses. We want to know whether the president’s tweets inflamed and mobilized individuals to take action.”On the day of the post, participants in TheDonald.win, a pro-Trump chat board, began sharing tactics and techniques for attacking the Capitol, the committee noted in a report released on Sunday recommending contempt of Congress charges for Dan Scavino Jr., Mr. Trump’s former deputy chief of staff. In one thread on the chat board related to the tweet, the report pointed out, an anonymous poster wrote that Mr. Trump “can’t exactly openly tell you to revolt. This is the closest he’ll ever get.’’Lawyers for the militants have repeatedly said that the groups were simply acting defensively in preparing for Jan. 6. They had genuine concerns, the lawyers said, that leftist counterprotesters might confront them, as they had at earlier pro-Trump rallies.Mr. Trump’s post came as his efforts to hang onto power were shifting from the courts, where he had little success, to the streets and to challenging the certification process that would play out on Jan. 6.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA week before his message, thousands of his supporters had arrived in Washington for the second time in two months for a large-scale rally protesting the election results. The event on Dec. 12, 2020, which Mr. Trump flew over in Marine One, showed his ability to draw huge crowds of ordinary people in support of his baseless assertions that the election had been stolen.But it also brought together at the same time and place extremist and paramilitary groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the 1st Amendment Praetorian, who would be present on Jan. 6.On Dec. 14, the Electoral College met and officially declared Mr. Biden the winner of the election.ImageAn event in Washington on Dec. 12, 2020 showed the former president’s ability to draw huge crowds in support of his lies that the election had been stolen.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York TimesBut behind closed doors, outside advisers to Mr. Trump were scrambling to pitch him on plans to seize control of voting machines across the country. The debate over doing so came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting that lasted well into the evening on Dec. 18, 2020, and ended with the idea being put aside.Hours later, the president pushed send on his tweet.“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” he wrote at 1:42 a.m. on Dec. 19. “Be there, will be wild!”Almost at once, shock waves rippled through the right.At 2:26 a.m., the prominent white nationalist Nicholas J. Fuentes wrote on Twitter that he planned to join Mr. Trump in Washington on Jan. 6. By that afternoon, the post had been mentioned or amplified by other right-wing figures like Ali Alexander, a high-profile “Stop the Steal” organizer.But Mr. Trump’s message arguably landed with the greatest impact among members of the same extremist groups that had been in Washington on Dec. 12.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOn Dec. 15, Stewart Rhodes, the leader and founder of the Oath Keepers, posted an open letter to Mr. Trump urging him to invoke the Insurrection Act. The next day, the national council of the Three Percenters Original group issued a statement, saying their members were “standing by to answer the call from our president.”Once the call came, early on Dec. 19, the extremists were ecstatic.ImageStewart Rhodes, the leader and founder of the Oath Keepers, declared a few days after Mr. Trump’s tweet that there would be “a massively bloody revolution” if Joseph R. Biden Jr. ever took office.Credit...Susan Walsh/Associated Press“Trump said It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!! It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!!,” Kelly Meggs, a Florida leader of the Oath Keepers, wrote on Facebook on Dec. 22. “He wants us to make it WILD that’s what he’s saying. He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are heading to DC.”That same day, Mr. Rhodes did an interview with one of his lieutenants and declared that there would be “a massively bloody revolution” if Mr. Biden took office.On Dec. 23, Mr. Rhodes posted another letter saying that “tens of thousands of patriot Americans” would be in Washington on Jan. 6, and that many would have their “mission-critical gear” stowed outside the city.The letter said members of the group — largely composed of former military and law enforcement personnel — might have to “take arms in defense of our God-given liberty.”Capitol Riot’s Aftermath: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4Trump’s tweet. Weeks before the Jan 6 attack, President Donald J. Trump sent a tweet that ended “Be there, will be wild!” Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators have gathered growing evidence of how this tweet was a crucial call to action for militants in the riot.Judge says Trump likely committed crimes. In a court filing in a civil case, the Jan. 6 House committee laid out the crimes it believed Mr. Trump might have committed. The federal judge assigned to the case ruled that Mr. Trump most likely committed felonies in trying to overturn the 2020 election.Virginia Thomas’s text messages. In the weeks before the Capitol riot, Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, sent several texts imploring Mark Meadows, President Trump’s chief of staff, to take steps to overturn the election. The Jan. 6 House committee is likely to seek an interview with Ms. Thomas, said those familiar with the matter.Contempt charges. The Jan. 6 House committee voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro, a former White House adviser, and Dan Scavino Jr., a former deputy chief of staff, for refusing to comply with its subpoenas.By the end of December, court filings say, the Oath Keepers had reserved three hotel rooms in Arlington, Va. The rooms were meant as a staging ground for three teams of armed militiamen poised to rush across the river into Washington on Jan. 6 if needed.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOn New Year’s Eve, court papers say, one team member from Arizona told Mr. Rhodes that his men were ready. “Everyone coming has their own technical equipment and knows how to use it,” the militiaman wrote in an encrypted message to his leader.By then, prosecutors say, Mr. Rhodes seemed set on action.“There is no standard political or legal way out of this,” he wrote to his group.The Proud Boys — who had long been some of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters — also viewed his message as a clarion call, prosecutors say.On the same day it was posted, Joseph Biggs, a Proud Boy leader from Florida, sent a private message to the group’s chairman, Enrique Tarrio, suggesting that they had to start recruiting better members — “not losers who wanna drink,” as he put it.“Let’s get radical and get real men,” Mr. Biggs wrote.ImageThe rally on the National Mall before a mob entered the Capitol.Credit...Pete Marovich for The New York TimesThe next day, Mr. Tarrio established a crew of “hand-selected members” for rallies that was known internally as the Ministry of Self-Defense, or MOSD, according to an indictment released this month. As MOSD turned its attention to Jan. 6, court papers say, Mr. Tarrio set up an encrypted Telegram chat for the group.Two days after Christmas, Charles Donohoe, a Proud Boys leader from North Carolina, posted a message complaining that local officials in Washington appeared to be planning to restrict access to the city on Jan. 6. “They want to limit the presence so they can deny Trump has the People’s support,” Mr. Donohoe wrote. “We can’t let them succeed.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe next week, another MOSD member posted a message reading, “Time to stack those bodies in front of Capitol Hill.” A third member raised the prospect of a mob of “normies” — or normal people — pushing through police lines and breaking into the Capitol. “A few million vs A few hundred coptifa should be enough,” he wrote.At the same time, prosecutors say, other Proud Boys were setting up crowdfunding campaigns for travel expenses and “protective gear and communications.” As the year came to an end, Mr. Tarrio posted a message on social media saying that the Proud Boys intended to “turn out in record numbers on Jan. 6th” but this time “with a twist.”“We will not be wearing our traditional Black and Yellow,” he wrote, a reference to the Fred Perry polo shirts favored by the group. “We will be incognito and we will be spread across downtown DC in smaller teams.”On Dec. 21, the intelligence arm of the Capitol Police issued a 7-page report tracking an increase in activity on TheDonald.win, which made threatening references to potentially trapping lawmakers in the tunnels of the Capitol. The report listed militia groups expected to descend on Capitol Hill for Jan. 6, including the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.The report also stated that Trump supporters were promoting “confronting members of Congress and carrying firearms during the protest.”ImageBroken glass at the entrance of the Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 6.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesIt included more than two dozen comments from posters, including:“Forget the tunnels. Get into Capitol Building.”“Surround every building with a tunnel entrance/exit. They better dig a tunnel all the way to China if they want to escape.”And: “Bring guns. It’s now or never”"

We just haven’t realized it yet.And even as Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine shows that wars of aggression are no relic of the past — the “return of history,” Rubio calls it — he worries that China’s Communist rulers pose a more insidious, long-term danger to America’s peace and prosperity, and that the threat isn’t being treated with the seriousness it deserves.“It does us no good to pretend they’re not an adversary,” Rubio said in an interview. “Their goal is to rise at the expense of the United States.”As the top Republican on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, Rubio has access to the latest insights from U.S. spy agencies. And what he has seen of China’s growing reach has alarmed him: a campaign of economic espionage and infiltration of American institutions; a rapid buildup of nuclear and conventional forces that menace Taiwan; an expanding disinformation machine that seeks to undermine the U.S. all over the world.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThose concerns are widely shared by Democrats in Washington. Since taking office, the Biden administration has taken steps to bolster America’s alliances in Asia, reoriented NATO toward confronting China, approved nearly $1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, hit Chinese officials with sanctions, and sharply criticized China’s human rights policies and trade practices. Congress is busy finalizing the COMPETES Act, a mammoth piece of legislation both parties have framed as vital to countering China. But if Republicans take control of Congress in November, they will be in position to push for an even harder line.On Tuesday, Rubio will give a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, in which he plans to argue that “Beijing’s military might, ideological challenge to democracy, technological ambitions and influence over the global market pose an even more serious and systematic threat than the Soviet Union ever did.”Winning that conflict blinded Americans to the dark reality of totalitarianism, in Rubio’s telling. “Over the past three decades, we forgot that human nature tends toward a lust for domination,” read portions of his remarks that were shared with The New York Times. “The desire of the powerful to conquer, enslave and control those weaker than themselves.”What America needs above all else, Rubio argues, is “unity and clarity about the threat we face.”The speech is a forceful entry into the debate in Washington and among Republicans over how to deal with Beijing. How much emphasis should U.S. leaders place on Russia versus China? Is China an adversary to be combated or merely a fierce competitor? Is the United States losing its edge? And, if so, what is to be done about it?Rubio’s own Twitter feed embodies the competing demands on policymakers’ attention. Even as he hones his arguments on China, he’s been live-tweeting his insights on the war in Ukraine.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Republicans are wrestling with whether and how to prioritize these threats,” said Elbridge Colby, who was a senior defense official in the Trump administration. “But the truth is that we’re not just going to rewind the clock to 1989 and everything’s going to be like the old days.”A drive to out-hawk the hawksRepublicans may be divided on Russia — between mainstream national security hawks and a smaller faction that admires Putin’s perceived toughness and his defense of traditional values — but criticizing China is a surefire political winner on the right.In a poll conducted last year, nearly half of Americans said they viewed China as the greatest enemy of the United States, a number double what it was 2020. In a survey last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 64 percent of Republicans said the United States should try to limit China’s rise, whereas 60 percent of Democrats said they preferred cooperation and engagement.“Republicans are very negative toward China, more so than Democrats,” said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. He noted that the coronavirus pandemic had fueled growing skepticism of China and its role in the world.China is already proving to be a potent campaign issue in the 2022 midterms, as Republican politicians try to out-hawk one another in primaries for congressional seats. In Midwestern states hobbled by the loss of manufacturing jobs, it’s a domestic policy topic as much as it is a national security concern.In Ohio, Mike Gibbons, a businessman who is leading the Senate Republican primary in some polls, is fending off allegations that he once favored outsourcing jobs to China.In Pennsylvania’s Senate race, David McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, and Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor, are trading accusations over who is more tainted by Beijing.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFor Rubio, his first task is to get re-elected in Florida this year. But he has run for president once before, and allies expect he may do so again.

The U.S. also depends on China for raw materials like rare earth minerals, used in everything from mobile phones to semiconductors to car batteries. And Beijing’s cooperation is essential to making progress on climate change, Biden administration officials emphasize.In the event of a war over Taiwan, Rubio said, “It won’t be as easy to sanction China as it was to sanction Putin.” Not only can China wield far greater military and financial muscle than Russia, but American elites are also more deeply compromised by their ties to Beijing, he argued.“China’s been very effective at deputizing the American corporate sector as their lobbyists,” Rubio said. It’s something he says he experienced firsthand when he pushed for sanctions over China’s treatment of its Muslim minority.The administration has resisted labeling China as an outright enemy, even as it steps up its criticism of the Chinese government. During his speech last year to the U.N. General Assembly, President Biden said, “We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs.”But the White House’s actions suggest otherwise.

All told, Biden is asking for $813.3 billion in national security spending, a 4 percent bump from 2022. Much of the new money would go to counter threats from China, Iran and Russia.

Ron DeSantis of Florida signed legislation on Monday that prohibits classroom instruction and discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary school grades, a law that opponents have called “Don’t Say Gay.”“We will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination,” Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, said from a classroom at a charter school in Spring Hill, Fla., north of Tampa.The law, titled “Parental Rights in Education,” has drawn national criticism from L.G.B.T.Q. organizations that fear it will have a chilling effect among teachers and young students.Workers at Disney, one of the state’s major employers and corporate political donors, staged walkouts in protest after the bill passed the Legislature, even after the company’s chief executive had apologized to employees for not taking a stronger stand against the legislation and paused contributions to political campaigns.  On Monday, Disney released a statement condemning the new law and urging lawmakers to repeal it or the courts to strike it down. AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOn Sunday night, the Oscar hosts Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes chanted “gay, gay, gay,” in a nod to the Florida legislation. President Biden called the proposal “hateful.”“DeSantis is attempting to censor and exclude an entire community of people from our public schools for his own political gain,” State Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, an Orlando Democrat and the state’s first openly gay Latino lawmaker, said in a statement. “This law doesn’t solve any problem that exists.”The uproar did little to move the governor or lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Legislature, who spent much of their annual session passing legislation to put Florida at the forefront of the nation’s culture wars, including a 15-week abortion ban, while avoiding pressing issues such as the state’s lack of affordable housing and shaky insurance market.If anything, the opposition from progressive activists, corporate boardrooms and A-list stars made Mr. DeSantis, who faces re-election in November and clearly harbors presidential ambitions, more of a warrior figure to his political base.“If those are the types of people that are opposing us on parents’ rights, I wear that like a badge of honor,” he said at the bill signing. “I don’t care what corporate media outlets say, I don’t care what Hollywood says, I don’t care what big corporations say. Here I stand. I’m not backing down.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHe spoke behind a lectern with a campaign-style sign in front reading, “PROTECT CHILDREN SUPPORT PARENTS,” and held up posters showing what he said were examples of teaching materials found in some Florida schools, including an apparent page from a picture book about a transgender boy.Mr. DeSantis argued that the law is a popular, common-sense measure limited in scope to the school curriculum. He blasted critics for what he said was willfully misinterpreting its provisions, though some of the language in the law is vague and subject to interpretation.“They’re doing it because they actually support having woke gender ideology in the first grade,” the governor said.The law could have far-reaching implications to children in other grades and without any connection to L.G.B.T.Q. issues. It will allow parents to opt out of counseling and mental health services and to sue school districts for any perceived violations. Districts will have to cover the costs of those lawsuits."

A description of the plan was shared with The New York Times.According to directions given to senior homeland security officials on Sunday, if single adults refuse to be vaccinated, they will be detained and put into deportation proceedings. If they request asylum and cannot remain in detention, they will be released with a monitoring device “with stringent conditions.” If migrant families refuse vaccination, they will also be given monitoring devices with the same conditions.The White House has said little about whether it will soon lift the public health order, which the Trump administration put in place at the start of the pandemic. The order, known as Title 42, gives border officials the authority to turn back migrants seeking to enter the United States so that they do not spread the coronavirus here, a precaution that public health experts have called unnecessary.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is supposed to review whether the rule is still necessary at this stage in the pandemic, and issue a decision in the coming days.The administration’s decision to start vaccinating some undocumented migrants appears to be an acknowledgment that there are measures other than the public health order that can be taken to minimize the spread of the coronavirus across borders. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said vaccinating immigrants in the department’s custody is a “public health best practice.” The spokesman did not explain why the department had waited so long to put that practice in place with regard to undocumented migrants, many of whom come from Central America. Planning for these vaccinations has been in the works. In November, the administration put out a request for a short-term contract to provide Covid-19 vaccinations at points along the southwest border.Previously, the administration has resisted vaccinating undocumented immigrants, despite multiple proposals from the Department of Homeland Security over the past year on how to do it. President Biden’s domestic policy adviser, Susan Rice, has privately raised concerns that it would provide an incentive for more undocumented migrants to try to cross the border, according to three current and former government officials with knowledge of the ongoing discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Noah Gottschalk, the global policy lead at Oxfam America, said that argument makes little sense.“Based on our work in the regions and places that people are coming from, that would have absolutely nothing to do with people coming,” he said. “People have access to vaccines. They are coming because they’re fleeing persecution.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyInside the Homeland Security Department, officials have been planning for Title 42 to end in early April. They expect large crowds of migrants as a result, exceeding the already-high numbers that have been crossing without documentation in recent weeks.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 10:41 a.m. ET2 hours ago2 hours agoThe F.D.A. authorizes second Covid booster shots for those 50 and older, and some immunocompromised people.Here’s how Shanghai’s lockdown is testing China’s ‘Covid-zero’ policy, and people’s limits.Experts warn of racial disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of long Covid.Since President Biden has been in office, there has been a significant spike in the number of migrants crossing the southwest border, many fleeing poverty and persecution. The administration has used the public health rule to expel migrants a little more than half of the time, allowing in others with humanitarian exemptions.Migrant children who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian have been exempted from the rule and allowed to enter. The administration has been offering vaccinations to eligible migrant children in government shelters for months; Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also been offering vaccinations to immigrants in detention. And the administration has been vaccinating asylum-seeking migrants who are waiting in Mexico until the United States makes a decision on their case.Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said vaccinations should have been offered to all undocumented migrants apprehended on American soil.“There’s no actually valid argument to not vaccinate people at the border, especially when our vaccination rates are the lowest that they’ve been in the United States and we’re actually throwing vaccine in the trash,” Dr. Adalja said. “If they don’t do this, they would rather put vaccine in the trash can than put it into a migrant’s arm, is basically what that amounts to.”Critics of the order say it is being used to control the influx of undocumented migrants. The Biden administration, which has relied heavily on scientific evidence to justify many other health precautions during the pandemic, has not produced data that shows undocumented migrants play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus.In a ruling regarding the use of the policy, a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted the lack of data.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We are not cavalier about the risks of Covid-19. And we would be sensitive to declarations in the record by C.D.C. officials testifying to the efficacy” of the public health order, the panel wrote earlier this month. “But there are none.”They added: “From a public-health perspective, based on the limited record before us, it’s far from clear that the C.D.C.’s order serves any purpose.”The White House and Homeland Security Department have consistently said the public health order is issued at the sole discretion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“It is not a matter of immigration policy,” Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Homeland Security secretary, said on March 17. The C.D.C. determines the order’s necessity, he said, “on a public health basis, depending on where we are in the arc of the Covid-19 pandemic.”Mr. Mayorkas pointed to the spread of variants in other countries. While Covid case numbers are falling in most of the United States, an Omicron subvariant, BA.2, is fueling an increase in cases in Europe and could cause another surge here, although it does not appear to be causing widespread severe illness.The administration has been fighting in court to keep the public health order in place for migrant families, even though many are already exempted from it. The same appeals panel that noted earlier this month that the C.D.C. had not presented any evidence justifying the order also ruled that the administration could not use it to expel families to countries where they would face persecution or torture.Lawyers were supposed to file a status update last week, but instead asked for an extension until after the C.D.C. decides whether to keep the rule in place.Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting."

But each spring, people of the diaspora have made their way along two-lane country roads, driving through cotton fields and catfish farms and finally  into Dumas for Hood-Nic, the community’s big “neighborhood picnic,” which serves as an informal homecoming.It is typically a low-key day full of preachers, rappers, raffles, food trucks and a contest for custom-car owners. The event raises money for scholarships and promotes nonviolence. But this year, organizer Sylvester Spinks Jr. said, something “allowed the devil to slide in.”An evening eruption of gunfire in a crowd of roughly 1,500 people at the Hood-Nic festival on March 19 resulted in the largest mass shooting in the United States this year, leaving a 23-year-old man dead and 26 other people wounded, including five children. Last week, authorities arrested Brandon D. Knight, 22, a North Little Rock man who, according to a police affidavit, admitted to firing a handgun at a man who he said had robbed and shot an acquaintance that day.ImageA Saturday evening  eruption of gunfire in a crowd of roughly 1,500 people at the Hood-Nic festival resulted in the largest mass shooting in the United States so far this year.Credit...Rory Doyle for The New York TimesAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImageIn Dumas, Hood-Nic is the city’s big “neighborhood picnic,” serving as an informal homecoming.Credit...Rory Doyle for The New York TimesThe police found 17 spent shell casings that they said were compatible with a .40 caliber Glock handgun belonging to to Mr. Knight. But Arkansas state police have not fully explained what happened, and said their investigation was ongoing.In the days that followed, bandaged victims trickled home from hospitals, and the parking lot of the shuttered discount store where the event was held was cleaned of bloodstains. Dumas, a city of 4,000 people 90 miles southeast of Little Rock, seemed united in anger and grief: Nearly everyone in town seemed to have some connection to the families of the wounded.And there was grave concern that another victim of gun violence could be Hood-Nic itself, a grass-roots event that has united scattered friends and family for years and served as a bright spot in a place of grinding poverty and diminished opportunities.“It got bigger and bigger every year,” Curtis Allen, 68, a retired trucker, said of Hood-Nic. But after the shooting, Mr. Allen said, “I know a lot of folks are going to say they aren’t going to go to another one of those things.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe solutions proposed for Hood-Nic, and for Dumas, reflect the priorities and anxieties of a nation that is reeling from what recent data suggests is a 30 percent rise in murders since 2019. Some residents wondered if metal detectors and surveillance cameras would help. The Rev. Arthur L.

The national gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety notes that the rate of gun deaths increased by 40 percent in the state in the last decade, compared to 33 percent nationwide.The recent political climate has favored loosening gun restrictions even further. Last year, the Republican-controlled State Legislature passed a law that allows residents to carry concealed weapons without a permit. Mr. Knight told the police he had kept his handgun in his waistband. He was arrested on suspicion of battery and aggravated assault, but has not been accused of violating any weapons possession laws.The Hood-Nic festival began in 2004, an attempt to build something positive in a community that was already shrinking dramatically, as farms grew increasingly mechanized and companies moved overseas. Mr. Spinks and a group of friends built on an existing front-yard barbecue and added rap performances and other attractions.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“At that time, there was a lot of crime going on,” said Jesse Webb, an organizer who was living in Ohio at the time. “And you’ve got to realize, this is a very small place. Anytime we would call home, something bad had happened. Somebody got killed. Somebody was robbing a bank. It was just all kind of crazy stuff.”The challenges facing Dumas, the largest city in Desha County, are common in the flat, fertile Arkansas Delta region. The county population plummeted from roughly 20,000 people in 1980 to about 11,400 in 2020, according to census figures. Poverty stands at 22.8 percent — twice the national average. Dumas once boasted two new car dealerships and a Walmart, but all are gone now. The Walmart was replaced by an outpost of a regional discount chain, Fred’s, which declared bankruptcy in 2019. Its broad expanse of empty asphalt served as a convenient setting for this year’s Hood-Nic.Image Jesse Webb helped to start Hood-Nic in 2004, building on an existing front-yard barbecue and adding rap performances by himself and others.Credit...Rory Doyle for The New York TimesImageThe population of Dumas and the surrounding Desha County has been shrinking for decades.Credit...Rory Doyle for The New York TimesThe legacy of segregation in the majority-Black city remains palpable. In Dumas, train tracks separate what are still considered Black and white sides of town, although those distinctions have blurred over the years. Mayor Simon is the first African American elected to the job. Hood-Nic has been notable as a popular community event started by Black organizers. This year, an added sense of anticipation preceded Hood-Nic; the event had been canceled the two previous years because of the pandemic.

He saw the man who was killed, Cameron Shaffer, 23, lying motionless on the pavement.Moments later he found his grandson, who was paralyzed with fear. A stranger had pushed the boy behind a car to shield him. Soon, Rev. Joyner said, another round of gunfire rang out.According to the affidavit, Mr. Knight, the accused gunman, told the police he was shot in the chest and the arm by the man who had tried to rob his friend. He was hospitalized, and arrested upon release. Another injured person had identified him while he was on a gurney.Mr. Knight also told the police he did not know how many times he fired after pulling his handgun from his waistband.

Later, he told a reporter that the conversation should include revisiting “open-carry” and other Arkansas gun laws.Mr. Webb and Mr. Spinks, the Hood-Nic co-founders, said it was too early to say what would become of their festival. Their focus for now, they said, was on raising funds for victims.“This has always been about the kids,” Mr. Webb said, “and a lot of the kids are still traumatized.”"
"1648571337-1180","https://www.nytimes.com/section/us","With a Center-Leaning Budget, Biden Bows to Political RealityThe president’s budget addresses the main attack lines that Republicans are using against him and his Democratic allies in Congress in the run-up to the midterm congressional elections.By Jonathan Weisman","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/budget-biden-politics.html","With a Center-Leaning Budget, Biden Bows to Political Reality","March 28, 2022","Jonathan Weisman","WASHINGTON — With his party facing potentially gale-force headwinds in the midterm elections, President Biden on Monday tacked toward the political center with a budget that would bolster military and law enforcement spending while tackling inflation and deficit reduction in service of what he called a “bipartisan unity agenda.”The core of his proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins a month before the midterms did not change significantly from his first budget blueprint a year ago. To universal prekindergarten and combating climate change he actually added a new tax on the wealth of billionaires.But its framing was a marked shift from the 2021 pitch for a fundamental transformation of an ailing American society. Instead, Mr. Biden’s plan was an appeal based on the reality of the moment, to both new dangers around the globe and at home, where inflation and crime are crushing the president’s political standing.Endangered Democrats in swing districts have been urging Mr. Biden to counter the messages from the far left and address the kitchen-table issues facing voters with incremental steps, not transformative legislation. For them, the budget promises deficit reduction to cool the economy and tangible steps to unclog supply-chain bottlenecks that contribute to rising prices.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe heft of his message this year comes not from an urgent appeal to address racial and income inequality, climate change and the struggles of the middle class, but to reassert American dominance in a dangerous and competitive world.“We are at the beginning of a decisive decade that will determine the future of strategic competition with China, the trajectory of the climate crisis and whether the rules governing technology, trade and international economics enshrine or violate our democratic values,” the budget states, justifying large increases to project U.S. military and diplomatic strength globally.Under the new plan, the left wing’s hopes for a peace dividend at the end of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would be scotched in favor of a new great powers military budget that would bring the Defense Department’s allocation to $773 billion, an increase of nearly 10 percent over the level for the 2021 fiscal year. Rather than cuts, Mr. Biden pledges to bolster the nation’s nuclear weapons program, including all three legs of the nuclear “triad”: bombers, land-based intercontinental missiles and submarines.Domestically, the big-ticket items from last year are still there: universal prekindergarten, generous subsidies for child care and commitments to clean, renewable energy. Representative Ro Khanna of California, a prominent progressive, praised the proposed 20 percent minimum tax on billionaires that would, for the first time, tax unrealized gains on assets if income taxes fell short of the minimum.“As a representative of Silicon Valley that arguably has more billionaires than anywhere in the world,” Mr. Khanna said, “I have been saying for years, raise their taxes to help build a society with fair opportunity for everyone.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut that is not where the president’s emphasis was. He relegated much of his Build Back Better domestic policy agenda — a nearly $2 trillion smorgasbord of proposed safety net and climate programs that drew unanimous Republican opposition and fractured his own party — to a single line item in the budget document, with no price tag and no detail, leaving it to Congress to determine if any of it could be salvaged. And he made a concerted effort to take the sting out of the issues of crime and immigration that Republicans have been using against Democrats.Far from defunding the police and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, two popular slogans on the left, the budget robustly funds both. Customs and Border Protection would receive $15.3 billion and ICE $8.1 billion, including $309 million for border security technology — a well-funded effort to stop illegal migration. The nation’s two primary immigration law enforcement agencies would see increases of around 13 percent.The budget even includes $19 million for border fencing and other infrastructure.Federal law enforcement would receive $17.4 billion, a jump of nearly 11 percent, or $1.7 billion, over 2021 levels. And the president, acknowledging widespread concerns that are driving Republican attacks against Democrats, vowed to tackle the rise in violent crime.“The answer is not to defund our police departments,” Mr. Biden said at the White House on Monday. “It is to fund our police and give them all the tools they need.”The proposals track with some of the main attack lines Republicans are using against Democrats in the run-up to the November contests, as they portray Mr. Biden and his allies in Congress as weak on security, soft on crime and profligate with federal spending to the point of damaging the economy.Liberal Democrats would see some of their priorities addressed, including substantial funding for climate programs and “environmental justice” initiatives, as well as changes to incarceration policy. But some progressives were left deeply disappointed. In lieu of broad student debt forgiveness, an executive order that many Democrats have been pressing for since Mr. Biden’s inauguration, the Education Department’s student lending services would receive a huge increase, 43 percent, to $2.7 billion.Activist groups that had helped shift the Democratic Party leftward were not giving up. Immigrants’ rights groups calling themselves Defund Hate planned a news conference for Tuesday to “outline their expectations for President Biden to redirect billions in funding from immigration enforcement, militarization and policing toward humane, community-based resources that invest in the true needs of Black, brown and immigrant communities.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Movement for Black Lives denounced a budget that would spend $30 billion on policing and only $367 million on “police reform, the prosecution of hate crimes, enforcement of voting rights and efforts to provide equitable access to justice.”Mr. Biden purposely shrugged such criticism off. “Isn’t it kind of fascinating that when I first got elected, I was being beat up because I supported the police too much for a period of 30 years?” he told reporters when asked if he was responding to Republican attacks. “No, that’s what I think.”Republicans indicated they were not about to shift their lines of attack.“Don’t let Biden’s budget fool you — Biden does not support the police,” said a statement the Republican National Committee issued on Monday. “If he did, he would call on Democrat-run cities to stop undermining law enforcement.”In Congress, Republicans zeroed in on the substance of the budget, not the message, emphasizing that it would increase funding for climate programs and other liberal priorities that did not get much ink beyond the spending tables.“President Biden would rather grind his ideological ax and escalate his holy war on made-in-America fossil fuels,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.Nor do Republicans believe the president can shift the narrative now. The realities of rising prices and violent crime are not likely to change by November, and even if they do, voter perceptions tend to lag.“Kitchen-table issues like rising prices, the economy and public safety will take the front seat in November,” predicted Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund, the main G.O.P. super PAC trying to deliver a Republican majority in November.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDemocratic leaders latched on to the shifting message. The Democratic National Committee on Monday blasted out the headlines it liked, which were decidedly not grandiose. One from Detroit blared, “Biden’s Nearly $6T Budget Aims to Bolster EVs, Great Lakes and PFAS Cleanup,” referring to money for electric vehicles and getting rid of a dangerous manufactured chemical that has tainted water supplies in industrial regions. Another, from Miami, celebrated that “Biden Seeks More Money for Everglades Restoration in 2023 Budget.” In Harrisburg, Pa., the story was, “Biden Lays Out a ‘Fund the Police’ Budget Plan.”"
