By 2050, some 68 percent of the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas, up from today’s 55 percent. Just three countries are responsible for about one-third of this growth – China, India, and Nigeria. But as cities expand, a large proportion of society continues to be marginalised and excluded — people with disabilities.
Unlike any other marginalised group, anyone can become a member of the disability community at any point in their life. People can develop a physical disability because of an accident, illness, or simply, old age.

According to the United Nations, people with disabilities include those who have “long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments, which in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others”.
Nigeria’s Lagos, with its 15 million residents, is one of Africa’s largest cities and is among the fastest growing in the world. Notoriously congested roads, chaotic traffic and widespread poverty makes Lagos a tough city to live in and navigate. But add a lack of access to public transport and getting around becomes even tougher for people with disabilities.
So what does it mean to live in Lagos, one of the world’s megacities, with a disability?

Getting around Lagos – a snapshot
The average person in Lagos spends at least two hours stuck in traffic every day. With no train or subway system, commuters rely solely on motorised vehicles.
Public transport accounts for 98 percent of the traffic, according to Professor Gbadebo Odewumi, the dean of the school of transport at Lagos State University.
But it is disorganised, largely unreliable and highly inaccessible for people with disabilities.
There are 75,000 yellow unregulated privately owned minibuses, popularly called “danfos”, in Lagos. These are 20th-century 14-seater Volkswagen buses with seats and backrests without padding and they run on fume-emitting engines. The boarding experience of passengers with disabilities largely comes down to the driver and conductor duo running the bus: they decide who they will take on board, who they will assist and who they will wait for.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Aiming to improve the formal transport sector, in 2008 the Lagos government entered the public transport business with Africa’s first-ever Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, a bus service that runs frequently and is designed to transport a large number of people. The buses themselves are comfortable and have specially reserved seats for people with disabilities. However, there are only 474 of them and they only go on main highways.
The ramps for wheelchair users are often either non-functional or not used, according to people in Lagos with disabilities. Staff are frequently not trained to help disabled passengers board, while other riders are not always sensitive to the needs of people in wheelchairs. For example, seats earmarked for people with disabilities are taken by able-bodied passengers.
Lagos has other privately owned transportation services, such as motorbikes and tricycles, known as keke. They can be especially convenient for some people with disabilities, such as people with visual or hearing impairments, as they can be arranged for pick up and drop off. However, these are not that useful for wheelchair users, for example, since there is no place to store the chair or other medical devices.
The least affordable mode of transport is e-hailing (Bolt or Uber) and regular taxis. A 40km trip with Bolt or Uber costs about 5,000 naira or $12. Rideshare and cab options are not feasible for many people with disabilities, in particular, those who live under the poverty line, that is, living on less than $1 a day. Forty percent of Nigeria’s population live in poverty. Nine out of 10 Nigerians with disabilities are estimated to live below the poverty line.

Plans for safer roads, accessible transport
Using the current public transport is a leap of faith for many people with disabilities.
However, the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority in 2018 released a new non-motorised transport policy (NMT) to reduce congestion, injuries and deaths on the roads, noise and air pollution. The policy says “mobility planning should focus on people, not vehicles” and aims to prioritise walking, cycling and public transport over the use of cars.
Pavements are non-existent in many places so pedestrians and vehicles share roads where drivers can drive dangerously, and even against traffic. By creating new and upgraded footpaths, the policy aims to reduce pedestrian accidents and deaths.
The NMT also includes people with disabilities with the plans to incorporate ramps, tactile pavements with textured ground surfaces to warn and guide visually impaired people and other features at public transport stations.
As part of modernising the city’s transit system, the Lagos government is also building a light rail. The first two of the seven proposed lines are scheduled to become operational by the start of 2023. Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said it will be part of a wider system that will be “attractive, convenient, affordable, accessible and will reduce urban transportation challenges”.
Initiatives such as the NMT and laws including the Lagos State Special Peoples’ Law, which stipulates that public transport should be easily accessible for people with disabilities, and the federal Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, assist and protects people with disabilities. However, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of implementation. For instance, the NMT committee to implement changes was inaugurated only three years after the announcement of the policy and there is no set date for completion.

Inaccessible cities: Lagos
Making cities accessible for people of all abilities is the first step towards true equity and inclusion.
To make Lagos more accessible, the city needs a taxi service that can take people with disabilities from their houses to the nearest accessible bus station, while public transport should become more accessible in line with the Lagos State Special People’s Law.
Without options to freely and independently move around the city, people with disabilities are forced to stay home and are invisible in Lagos’ public life.
Stuck in a vicious cycle, people with disabilities lack access to education, healthcare, employment, housing and systems of social protection. They face stigma, discrimination and even violence.
For Kelechukwu Ogu, a blind journalist from Lagos, being able to move and walk around Lagos freely and safely is critical. Over the years, his foot has slipped into gutters on the street and the possibility of getting stuck – and being hit by a vehicle – fills him with anxiety. Once, when he was 10 years old, he fell waist-deep into an open drain. No one stopped to help him out.
“My interaction with open drainages and the fear of being knocked down by a bike or car has trained me to endure hunger and deprivation while waiting for a sibling or neighbour to help me make purchases,” says Kelechukwu.

The deluge engulfed 30 of Nigeria’s 36 states, killing 363 people and displacing more than two million others. The floods washed away farmlands, settlements and critical public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and power installations.

I must have been the only person in the country who said we can avoid a food crisis,” Adesina, 62, told Al Jazeera.
The minister implemented a plan to accelerate the growth of maize, wheat and rice in the dry season as the country faced devastating food shortages. Growing those crops at that time of year was not typical in Nigeria, but it increased the food supply. The government also distributed free seeds and fertilisers to farmers affected by the floods and subsidised inputs for unaffected farmers, to boost food production.
“By the time we finished the action plan, instead of the price of food going up, the price of food crashed in Nigeria, by March. We started planting in October. By March, we had brought down the price of food.”
It was possible, Adesina said, through “knowing science, knowing technology, and deploying the right instruments at the right time”.
Effect of Ukraine war on Africa
Now, in his current role as the president of the African Development Bank, the continent’s largest multilateral lender, Adesina is trying to avert a food crisis on a larger scale. As the war between Russia and Ukraine draws into its second month, natural gas, wheat and fertiliser prices have skyrocketed.
Together Russia and Ukraine produce more than a quarter of global wheat exports, and Africa is heavily dependent on both countries. Wheat imports make up 90 percent of Africa’s $4bn trade with Russia and almost half of the continent’s $4.5bn trade with Ukraine, according to AfDB.
“One-third of the cereal supply of East Africa comes from those two countries, and Egypt is badly affected. So is Algeria and Morocco, Somalia and several other countries. So, if we don’t manage this very quickly, it will actually destabilise the continent,” Adesina said.
He said the war would affect Africa’s economy in a few major ways. Already, it has roiled financial markets, causing sky-high interest rates. “You begin to see what has happened also in terms of the yields for euro bonds that are posted by African countries. The spreads are very, very high as a result of this,” he said.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.  Fair.Sign upYour subscription failed.

But perhaps just as important, commodity prices are on the increase, including that of wheat which has “gone up by 64 percent globally”, the same price around the 2008 global food crisis, he said.
Fertilisers, a key component of the agribusiness sector, have also been affected, and the bank chief knows that that could spell disaster.
“The price of urea has gone up by 300 percent. All of that is saying, that it’s [the war] driving inflation in Africa, and it could — if not quickly well-managed — trigger a food crisis in Africa,” Adesina said.
 
(Al Jazeera)
Africa’s emergency food plan
Adesina is working on a $1bn emergency food production plan for Africa to avoid food shortages and bring down inflation. The AfDB-led project will help support 20 million farmers with access to climate-resilient agricultural technologies to boost food production to feed 200 million Africans.
Under the plan, farmers will be able to produce 30 million metric tonnes of food, including wheat, rice, maize, and soya beans. The output is expected to be valued at $12bn.
The COVID-19 pandemic plunged 26 million Africans into extreme poverty. “Now with this looming food crisis, and with the accelerating inflation, we’re going to see a lot more – a couple of million more – people fall into extreme poverty. And why? Because in the poor household, the price of food accounts for roughly 65 percent of their household expenditure.”
But Adesina is optimistic that this could be avoided if the emergency plan receives enough international support.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva was “very supportive” of the plan, he said. Adesina plans to call a meeting of African ministers of finance and the ministers of agriculture “very soon” to discuss it.
Adesina plans to deploy $1bn in two batches a year, in time for Africa’s growing seasons – May through to July in the northern hemisphere and October to December in the southern hemisphere. As it is an emergency facility, the funds will be grants, not loans.
“We’re going to be doing all we can for the rest of March and April to be able to get it,” he said. “Whatever we get, we will deploy immediately to begin to get seeds in the ground and for us to grow more food.”
African fuel for Europe
Some observers believe the conflict in Eastern Europe has presented an opportunity for African countries to become key energy suppliers and Adesina agrees.
“With the war in Ukraine, what that has actually shown is that Europe needs to diversify its own energy supply out of Russia,” Adesina said. “It depends on Russia for 45 percent of all of its gas, almost 115 billion cubic metres of gas — a place to look to is Africa.”
AfDB worked on a $25bn deal with Mozambique in 2020 for liquified natural gas (LNG), which will make the country the third-largest exporter of the commodity in the world. There are also hopes that the trans-Saharan pipeline — currently under construction — which will span from Nigeria to Algeria will be an integral part of any new agreements.
Adesina agreed.
“There are new gasfields that have been found in Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, so Africa can become a strategic supplier of gas for Europe. And I believe that Europe should invest together with us in the critical gas pipeline infrastructure to get gas from Africa to Europe,” he said.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP21054568597200.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

He made the trip in October 2019 where he received $15,000 which he claimed he was blackmailed into accepting by his hosts using a video of him taking cocaine.
Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Zimbabwe’s absence at Cricket World Cup ‘bitter pill to swallow’list 2 of 3Zimbabwe ex-cricket captain Taylor admits he took drugs, bribelist 3 of 3Dean du Plessis: Blind cricket commentator now losing his hearingend of listThe suspension has brought back into the limelight the plight of players and the state of the game in Zimbabwe where cricket has a significant fanbase.
Taylor, who accepted his offence, said he had been under financial pressure because the players had not been paid for six months around the time of his India trip.
At that time, the country was suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for government interference in the affairs of the governing body, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC), which came after a government-appointed body, that controls all sports in the country, fired top ZC officials on several charges, including financial mismanagement.
ZC, which is often in financial hardship but claims to have now completed payment of huge debts running into nearly $20m, has been forced to operate under controlled funding from the ICC.
The ZC suspension in 2019 therefore meant ICC funding was frozen and players had to bear the brunt of it.
The ICC suspension was eventually lifted later that year after the sacked officials were reinstated.
Players were then awarded a lump sum for the six months they were owed.
By early 2020, ZC announced it had reduced salaries by 30 percent, which was followed, until the present, by frequent delays in payments.
Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the 2019 World Cup, the first time it missed the tournament since 1983.
ZC chief Tavengwa Mukuhlani defended the cuts when he revealed the move two years ago, saying it was a necessary measure to “make sacrifices today and survive tomorrow”.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.  Fair.Sign upYour subscription failed. Please try again.Please check your email to confirm your subscriptionBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy 
The delays, Mukuhlani explained to Al Jazeera, were due to ICC’s strict financial controls.
He rejected allegations of misadministration, saying he had done well under the circumstances, especially after clearing what he refers to as “legacy debts”.
“We are in a very healthy financial situation,” Mukuhlani told Al Jazeera. “We are the only [sporting] association in the country that is audited by one of the big four in the world. We are the only association that constantly publishes results. We are moving from strength to strength.”
But the players are not totally satisfied with the board’s handling of things.
“I have played for Zimbabwe under some very difficult conditions in the past and we have gone for months without being paid,” said a senior player who requested anonymity.
“They need to improve their communication so that people can plan accordingly. Things have improved a bit, but there is just no consistency. My main issue with our administrators is that they don’t know how to communicate. Last year, when we had salary delays, we were left to just speculate.”
Talent drain
Disillusionment and lack of confidence in the system has also resulted in a serious talent drain, with many of the country’s brightest young players no longer finding the prospect of representing Zimbabwe appealing.
Dion Myers, a teenage prodigy and gifted young Black player, made his Test debut in 2021. He also played three One-Day Internationals and eight T20s.
A former headboy at one of the country’s prestigious schools, St George’s College in Harare, and Zimbabwe’s captain at the 2019 Under-19 World Cup, a national contract was almost guaranteed for Myers.
But he did not find it tempting and decided not to stick around.
Choosing to secure his future, the 19-year-old, at the advise of his family, is now studying Agriculture at Royal Agriculture University in Gloucestershire, England.
In 2018, Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the 2019 World Cup, the first time since 1983 they were not taking part in the global event. The team is currently sitting bottom of the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, pathway to 2023 World Cup qualification.
Based on current form, they may miss out on another World Cup which will be a huge financial blow.
Former Zimbabwe bowler Gary Brent, recently appointed the national women’s team coach, believes the country will be stronger if everyone available was allowed to contribute.
“I see cricket in Zimbabwe as I have seen it for the last 15 years,” Brent told Al Jazeera. “We have great talent but we are unable to fully harness and nurture that talent to be a fully competitive side in international cricket.
“It starts with grassroots all the way to franchise cricket. It’s a pity we can’t all work together to build a solid Zimbabwe cricket team. We have to forget what happened, we can’t do anything about it. If we work together, I’m sure we will be extremely competitive.”
Struggling with facilities
The grassroots that Brent speaks of are no longer as vibrant as they used to be 20 years ago when cricket was almost competing with football for public interest.
Government schools like Prince Edward and Churchill, which used to churn out a great number of national team players, are struggling with facilities and now produce half-baked players – a far cry from the likes of Tatenda Taibu, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura, Prosper Utseya – all former national captains who were schooled at the latter courtesy of ZC bursaries.
It is not just the schools that are having to contend with poor infrastructure.
Across the country, club facilities, which used to be looked after by the national association, are in bad shape because members are unable to meet costs for maintenance.
It is a reflection of the club game itself which is virtually non-existent, with seasons not coming to logical conclusions even in pre-pandemic times.
The strength of club cricket was what bred Zimbabwe’s competitive streak at international level. Promotion to the first XI, sharing a changing room with national team players, or facing international players in the opposition, was something for a young player to treasure.
It is a feature of Zimbabwean cricket that is very hard to speak of in the past tense by those who witnessed those days, like Nick Chouhan, a former ZC board member in charge of development.
A one-time sport broadcaster and now a regular blogger on the history of sport in Zimbabwe, Chouhan reckons the demise of club cricket structures has hurt the national side.
“There is no formal league cricket structure now, they are just playing when they want,” Chouhan said.
“Some players practice but there no games. You can spend the whole day in the nets, but if you can’t play proper games, it won’t be the same. Years back, we had eight teams in the first league, eight teams in the second league, eight teams in the third league and six to seven teams in the fourth league. We played league cricket from September to March, and all were completed.
“These days a lot of our players go straight into the national team. In the other countries, guys play 200 to 300 games before international cricket.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2015-03-14T120000Z_655682525_GM1EB3E0XDP01_RTRMADP_3_CRICKET-WORLD-IND-ZIM.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Slobodan Milošević had been waging wars in various parts of Yugoslavia and now he had brought his killing machine to Kosova. Sometimes I could see black pillars of smoke billowing from burning houses in the distance and on satellite TV I watched foreign journalists reporting on massacres and people fleeing their villages.
But in the hills of Prishtina, the capital of Kosova, we waited. And then it came – that looping sound of war blaring out across the city.
The mood changed. Suddenly, I had to replace the ashtray more often as my father, feeling agitated, chain-smoked.
The war stole my childhood. I had been a happy child with bundles of energy and football bruises on my skinny legs. In the summer, I played outside with other children and when the night came, I played indoors until forced to surrender to sleep.

But war swapped playtime with news time. My brothers and I would sit in front of the TV, flicking from German news to British news and sometimes, when my father insisted, to Serbian news.
I learned the names of every speaker at the UN Security Council – Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Igor Ivanov, Javier Solana, Robin Cook.
I felt the fear and anxiety as a kind of pressure that built up in my eardrums. The only way I could suppress it was to talk to my imaginary friend.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.

When an advert for a toy appeared on the TV, I would whisper to him. I would like the remote-controlled car followed by the Power Rangers outfit with all the gadgets, I would tell him. In my imagination, their delivery was instant; the house quickly filled with these toys. Perhaps my mind was experiencing the metaverse before Zuckerberg.
A 12 year old is on the cusp of becoming a teenager. But when you’re 12 in a war zone, it isn’t the same. You’re old enough to know that something terrible is happening but not yet old enough to feel able to engage with the adults.
When I heard artillery and bombs, I was too shy to say I was scared, but my parents knew. My father would talk about packing a bag with essentials in case we had to leave. So, one day, worried about leaving everything behind, I put on layer upon layer of clothes until I could hardly move. A little later, as the heat got to me, my mother removed some of the layers and assured me we would be safe.
I was fast-tracked into young adulthood. I stopped playing games, stopped annoying my brothers. Instead, I thought about dying and what Milošević would do next.
I wonder now if the children of Ukraine are thinking similar thoughts.
As I watch Ukrainian children on the TV, I can’t help but think about what will become of them. Some are now refugees. They might end up in countries they’d never even imagined, speaking languages they never thought they would.
Their lives might never be quite the same again.

I eventually fled Kosova with my family. But I did not escape the war. Wherever I went, that invisible badge of war remained etched inside me.
More than 10,000 Albanians lost their lives and over a million were forced out of Kosova before NATO intervened to stop the bloodshed and end the war. The wheels of news rolled on to the next crisis. But those of us who lived through it never left it behind.
War can seep into your emotions and suck your feelings dry. It can numb you, leave your soul hollow and put you in a mental state of paralysis.
In neighbouring Macedonia, where we first went as refugees, I would find myself staring at the grownups, but mentally, I wasn’t there. My mind floated through undefined thoughts. I was merely existing. At 12, my excitement for life had already evaporated.
I could not untangle myself from the war. But slowly, I made sure that it faded into the background. When I felt the war strap itself to me again, I would do something to distract myself. I’d imitate the adults around me and the funny Albanian dialect of the kind strangers who’d welcomed us into their homes. The mood, often tense and depressing, would instantly lighten. Gradually, I learned how to smile and laugh again.
From Macedonia, we went to the UK. I had never seen my late father cry until the day we landed in England. Perhaps they were tears of joy, knowing his children were now safe, 3,000 kilometres from home.
Humbled by the warm reception we received, my father would say: “God never forgets charitable people.”

Just like the war itself, the kindness we received back then has stayed with me. I remember Richard, the young boy from Cheshire who became my first English friend and helped me shake the war away, even giving me his Sega Mega Drive with all its games. Then there were the volunteers who helped us settle – Sue, who printed an Albanian eagle for me to colour, and Anita, Merry, Bridget and Pam, who took our family to the zoo – it was the first day we felt like a family again, smiling and safe.
I swapped bullets and bombs for toys and cuddles.
But it only takes a new conflict – with its accompanying images on the screen – for my badge of war to be reactivated. When I hear the sound of air-raid sirens in Ukraine, I am once again that little boy curled up in a foetal position in the dark, holding my mother’s hand and praying for the safety of our family.
Are the 12 year olds of Kharkiv and Kyiv, Dnipro and Donetsk experiencing something similar now? Will the badge of war stay with them as it has stayed with me? What damage will the war do to the 12 year olds of Mariupol and will they ever be able to heal their trauma?
Perhaps they are watching their mothers sob as I watched mine. Perhaps they, too, see the pain in their father’s eyes as their family’s dreams turn to rubble.
I have no doubt that they will carve their own paths to adulthood with courage and conviction; that they, too, will beat the warmongers and criminals who orchestrate such conflicts.
But right now, as this war continues, maybe they are telling themselves: ‘The war will be over, one day.’","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hasan_Chester_Zoo_July1999.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

“Without any doubt, climate change has obvious consequences and impacts, especially in remote areas,” the Jordanian Minister of Agriculture, Khaled Hneifat, told Al Jazeera.
“The Jordanian government has adopted measures and procedures to support the resilience of rural communities and farmers. We do that by supporting farmers, by subsidising products such as barley, and creating solutions for the lack of water.”
MENA Climate Week
The problems facing Hashim, and Jordan, are being faced across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.

Temperatures in the region have risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to an analysis of data from the last century, marking MENA as the region facing the gravest climate disaster in the world. According to the International Monetary Fund, climate disasters in the region have injured and displaced seven million people per year, and have caused more than 2,600 deaths and an estimated $2bn in physical damage.
This is the reason the first-ever MENA Climate Week took place March 28-31 in Dubai.
The event, hosted by the Emirati government and organised by the United Nations and the World Bank, aimed to function as a platform for the region’s governments and civil society to discuss opportunities for enhancing climate change.
“In Jordan, we need a fair share of support, especially when it comes to water scarcity, and regional collaboration in order to get the help that we need,” said Omar Shoshan, the chairman of the Jordan Environmental Union, who attended the conference.
“I see the week only as an opportunity for the MENA region to focus more on our challenges and possibilities for collaboration – but it has been very informative and a good opportunity to start the dialogue,” Shoshan added.

Effects on refugees
In Jordan, the effects of climate change are impacting the most vulnerable, in particular refugee communities.
“The fragile communities pay the price,” said Shoshan. “ An example is the Azraq area, where the second-largest refugee camp in Jordan is located. The area is extremely dry, and this affects the refugees living in the camp, as the water quality is very bad.”
Jordan hosts more than 750,000 refugees, the second-highest host country of refugees per capita in the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Approximately 18 percent of refugees in Jordan live in refugee camps.
“Due to the lack of water, the amount [of water] is controlled to an average of 35 litres per person per day,” said Lilly Carlisle, the spokesperson at UNHCR Jordan. “Most water comes from drilling holes inside the camps, but some has to be trucked in.”
UNHCR is responsible for the Syrian refugee camps in Za’atari and Azraq, which altogether host approximately 118,000 refugees. Those large numbers have taken a toll on Jordan’s infrastructure, but Carlisle said she has seen the refugees working hard to combat the effects of climate change.
“The resilience is remarkable; we see them innovating and creating new solutions for saving water,” Carlisle said. “Some people have created allotments to grow fruit and vegetables using hydroponics, as well as solutions on how to recycle water.”
Those innovative solutions are also used back on Hashim’s farm in Ghor; without them, his farm may be in an even more difficult position.
“I am doing my best by making creative solutions, such as reusing water from my home for watering the fields,” he said.
“I strongly believe in promoting local food, and also bringing the farmers closer to the customer, so that people can learn and see how we grow fruit and vegetables. This is important … so that we can meet the challenges caused by climate change.”","/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/000_98E6EX.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The country’s press union, of which she is vice president, gathered 100 reporters from across the Cape Verdean capital of Praia, and they assembled at the attorney general’s office. Inside, reporters Alexandre Semedo and Daniel Almeida were being grilled over a recent investigation.

“Jornalismo não é crime.” Journalism is not a crime.
“Não tentem nos calar.” Don’t try to shut us up.
“Society has the right to know everything that is of public interest,” Coelho, executive editor for the Cape Verdean weekly A Naçāo and vice president of the country’s press union, later told Al Jazeera.
For years, that right was guaranteed, sacred even, in this archipelago nation off the coast of West Africa, typically highly regarded for its press freedom.
In fact, in 2020, Reporters Without Borders, also known by its French acronym RSF, ranked Cape Verde 27th in the world for press freedom, higher than the United States, France, Spain and the United Kingdom.
But now, the limits of that freedom are being tested.
In the past three months, three reporters from two Cape Verdean outlets have been brought in for questioning by authorities after reporting on a murder investigation involving a government minister.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Their reports detailed a police investigation into Interior Minister Paulo Rocha, who was allegedly placed at the scene of a 2014 murder while he was deputy director of the judicial police. The victim was a suspect in another murder, of a police officer’s mother.
Rocha has denied any involvement in the murder. The attorney general’s investigation, however, was prompted by the journalists’ alleged disclosing of confidential judicial information in their reporting.
‘Qualified disobedience’
Prosecutors started investigating Santiago Magazine editor Herminio Silves in late January, following up with A Naçāo’s director Semedo and its reporter Almeida earlier last month, for “qualified disobedience” in regards to publishing confidential information.
The reporters have been declared “arguidos” – a Portuguese legal term meaning that they don’t have formal charges levelled against them, but are also in a phase beyond simply assisting the police with an investigation.
It also means they can’t continue to use the classified information they had access to in any successive reporting. The trio must also notify authorities if they leave their homes for more than five days or change their phone numbers.

These investigations are the first to ever be supported by the Cape Verdean prosecutor general, press advocates say.
Sadibou Marong, RSF’s West Africa director, told Al Jazeera that the case against the three journalists is both “unprecedented” and “disturbing”, given Cape Verde’s long history of being spared from press freedom violations.
“This is an attempt of intimidation,” Marong said. “Journalists covering any case, including those in which high-ranking officials or decision-makers are involved, must not be arrested and must not be targeted.”
A spokesman for the attorney general did not respond to a request for comment.
A united pushback
But these moves by the attorney general’s office – which press advocates say are meant to intimidate both the journalists being questioned and the media at large – are being met with resistance.  Reporters in Cape Verde have rallied around their colleagues, staging protests like the one at the attorney general’s office and petitioning members of government, all to challenge the media crackdown.
That unity has been essential in the pushback against the probe, said Angela Quintal, Africa programme director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international media rights organisation.
“There really isn’t much hurry for the state to charge them,” she said, adding that declaring them “arguidos” hinders further media investigations into the police investigation.
Beyond protests in Praia on the island of Santiago and in Mindelo on the island of São Vincente, the media in Cape Verde has also responded by contacting members of the government to lobby on their behalf.
They have also started the formal process of petitioning the government to clarify the law on qualified disobedience so that it wouldn’t apply to the media, Coelho said.
In response to clamouring in parliament, the justice minister, Joana Rosa, has signalled that the government could be open to debate on such changes.
Consequently, the investigations into the journalists have attracted attention and debate around the qualified disobedience law “in the media and on social networks, involving journalists, university professors, and jurists,” Almeida, one of the journalists under investigation, told Al Jazeera in a text message.
“The law is clear and does not need to be changed. The problem is [the attorney general’s] biased interpretation,” he said. “According to our interpretation and that of some constitutionalists, the journalist is not bound by judicial secrecy.”
Orlando Rodrigues, a journalist for the state-run Radiotelevisão Cabo-Verdiana who attended the February protest in Praia, said the attorney general’s investigation has had a chilling effect on media coverage of the police investigation.
At the same time, however, he’s convinced that the courts will clear the journalists’ names if the investigations into them aren’t dropped.
“Some journalists engage in self-censorship, some people recognise that. But in general, Cape Verde is a good country for press freedom,” said Rodrigues. “Certain politicians, from time to time, try to bring journalists to court on certain occasions. But that never succeeded in silencing journalists. They continue to do their work. And I think in this case [the journalists] will win.”
For now, the journalists remain “arguidos” and the debates continue in government halls, on social media, and in streetside cafés. And their colleagues across Cape Verde plan to keep their campaign alive.
Coelho in particular doesn’t regard the protests or the legal organising as pressuring the government, but simply the right thing to do. “Cape Verde is known for its press freedom, its democracy,” she said. “We don’t want to go backward. We want to go forward.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/b710ed8e-44f6-48dd-8943-f84e2ba5f5e1.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Her client hadn’t known freedom since 2003. She needed something to wear when she left detention for the first time in 16 years.
So Kim rushed to a discount department store and grabbed what she hoped would fit: a pair of joggers and a T-shirt.

Kim had only ever seen her client from across glass panels, seated during brief, 30-minute visits. The clothes Kim had picked were far too big for the petite, 4-foot-11.5-inch woman with the long dark hair who now stood free before her.
“In my mind, physically she was much bigger than she actually was,” Kim recalls. It felt like a “mismatch”: how someone as small and unassuming as Ny Nourn could have had such immense effect.
The story of how Nourn, 41, first came to be imprisoned is the story of her emergence as an advocate. As the co-director of the Asian Prisoner Support Committee — and an organiser for the domestic violence advocacy group Survived and Punished — Nourn has rapidly gained a reputation as one of the most high-profile voices in the fight to end what activists in the United States call the “prison-to-deportation pipeline”.
But Nourn doesn’t just speak out about that pipeline. She has lived it herself. And in sharing her story again and again — on panels, in interviews, even for a TEDx Talk — Nourn often finds herself confronting the horrors of her past as she works to educate others about the US criminal justice system.

‘Born into violence’
Born in 1980 in Khao-I-Dang, a Cambodian refugee camp near the border in Thailand, Nourn remembers sorrow among her earliest memories. At age 18, her mother had fled Cambodia on foot: the genocide there in the late 1970s killed more than 1.7 million people.
She raised Nourn alone in those early years. Nourn’s father had abandoned them both when Nourn was only one.
“I have very vague, sad memories — the majority of the time, being hungry, always needing my mother. She was working in the rice fields,” Nourn says. The world felt so huge at the time. Now, looking back, she considers herself “born into violence” — the trauma of the genocide leading to the trauma that followed.
At age five, Nourn left with her mother for the United States, where they settled first in Florida, then in California. There, in the city of San Diego, her mother married a fellow refugee from Vietnam, a man who worked as a mechanic. He too had suffered: he had been a prisoner of war, Nourn says.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

But very quickly, the relationship between Nourn’s mother and stepfather turned violent. They settled in Mira Mesa, a booming suburb dubbed by a local publication in June 1980 as “San Diego’s most wretched neighborhood” with its endless rows of identical houses. Although they were surrounded by military and Filipino families, Nourn remembers they had few resources to process their experiences as refugees. It was isolating.
“If you don’t deal with trauma, it bleeds into your life, your relationships, your family, your work. So that’s essentially what happened to like my parents, right? It bled into their relationships and into how I was raised,” Nourn says matter-of-factly, her eyes downcast behind a pair of round-rimmed glasses.
Even as Nourn’s family grew — with the arrival of her younger brother and sister — Nourn’s mother tried to keep the abuse she endured quiet. Nourn nevertheless caught glimpses of it. She witnessed her mother being beaten and raped.
She even remembers her mother reaching out to family friends for help, but they just told her to work it out. And Nourn’s stepfather would brush her mother aside, saying, “No one’s going to believe you.”
Living in that house felt like “constantly walking on eggshells”. And she grew to resent what she saw as her mother’s weakness.
Nourn even found herself asking, “Why couldn’t she just leave?” It was the same victim-blaming question she too would later face when she found herself trapped in her own abusive relationship.
“I really thought to myself, when I was growing up, that I would never want to be like my mother, right? I looked at her as very weak and docile,” Nourn says, shaking her head ever so slightly at the memory.
As a child, Nourn had learned a saying in Cambodian: “Men are gold. Women are cloth.” Nourn understood it to mean that men had value — and women were only useful in the household.
She started to resent her heritage. She thought, “If this is a culture that really does not value a woman’s worth, their gender, then I don’t want to be part of it.”
Shy and quiet, Nourn had few friends to confide in. Most days, her parents, who expected her to excel academically, made sure she came straight home from school, no dilly-dallying with classmates.
In order not to think about the violence at home, Nourn tried to bury herself in her schoolwork. She still remembers the shame of receiving her first B in eighth grade: her stepfather, who asked to see her report card every quarter, had been upset.
Gradually, she found solace in sports. Nourn took up soccer, tennis and badminton. Even to this day, she continues to run: it feels therapeutic to her.

Escaping reality online
But as Nourn neared the end of high school, her courses started to get more challenging. With the violence at home, she struggled to concentrate. It became more and more difficult to care about grades and school and sports.
Nourn’s parents, however, continued to have high hopes for her schooling. Her stepfather hoped to see her in college one day. Personal computers were exploding in popularity in the 1990s, so to help her with her school work, Nourn’s parents set her up with her own system: “one of those big screens with the big modem”.
Through America Online (AOL), the internet access service she used, Nourn discovered instant messaging and chat rooms. She knew that the people she met weren’t always who they said they were — but that was the point: to escape reality. “You could pretend to be anyone you wanted to be.”
There, in those online spaces, Nourn could feel wanted. There, she could feel less alone. “Unfortunately,” she says, “that’s how I met my co-defendant.”
Nourn was only 17 years old when she met Ronald Barker, a married Vietnamese man 17 years her senior, in August 1998. In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Nourn avoids using his name: she refers to him simply as her “co-defendant” and the man he killed their “victim”.
Over the internet, Barker claimed to be in his mid-20s. But seeing him in person, three days after connecting online, Nourn realised he was much older; at first, she suspected he might even be in his 40s. Barker was sensitive to the age difference, too. He insisted that Nourn keep their relationship a secret, that her parents wouldn’t approve.
Still, Nourn and Barker grew intimate quickly. They started to see each other every day. He told her the things that she longed to hear: that he loved her, that he wanted to marry her. He neglected to mention his pregnant wife and child at home.
“All I knew is that the one thing I wanted was just to break free from my home,” Nourn says. “And to live my life and share it with someone that I felt would love me.”
But the verbal abuse in their relationship began right away. Barker started to dictate what Nourn could wear, what time she should come home from school, and how she spent her free time. Barker had her trapped in a cycle of control and coercion, submission and compliance.
“To be frank, I was used to it,” Nourn says, referencing her upbringing. “I thought I could handle it.” She reassured herself, “As long as he does not put his hands on me, then I’m fine.”
That autumn, shortly after she turned 18, Nourn started working after school as a telemarketer at the dating service Perfect Match. She and her boss David Stevens — a 38-year-old divorcee and former state champion wrestler — became close. They went on a date in December 1998. But according to court documents, as she drove herself home that evening, Nourn noticed a car parked near her house. It was Barker.
Nourn told a defence psychologist that that night was the first time Barker beat and raped her, furious that she had had sex with another man. Calling her “used goods”, Barker demanded that she take him to Stevens’s apartment. Fearing for her life, she complied.
Posing as Nourn’s brother, Barker used Nourn to lure Stevens out for a drive. Then, as they pulled over on the side of a lonely road, Barker pulled out a gun. He grabbed Stevens by the neck. Over Nourn’s pleas of “no, no”, he shot Stevens twice in the head. He lit Stevens’s car on fire with his body still inside.
‘Every day was survival’
Three years later, the murder of David Stevens remained unsolved. And Nourn still lived in fear of Barker’s abuse. He had beaten her. Shot at her. Choked her until she had passed out. And if she tried to leave, he threatened to kill her and her family. Nourn says he forced her to undergo two abortions against her will.
By that point, Nourn had moved in with Barker and his wife: Barker explained her presence by saying she was the daughter of a family friend, in need of a place to stay. Nourn suspects his wife never questioned the arrangement because she was being abused too.
“Every day was survival for me,” Nourn recalls. She had started working at a mortgage company, where her colleagues noticed the bruises on her arms and legs.
“Of course, I would lie and say, ‘Oh, I fell in the shower, bumped into a chair,’” Nourn says. But one of her colleagues pulled her aside and said, “Chairs and showers don’t do that kind of bruising.” She too had been abused. She too knew the signs.
Nourn confided in her coworkers that she feared Barker would kill her. She knew he was capable of it. But her colleagues didn’t understand why. So she told them the story of what happened that December night in 1998. Their response was immediate: “You have to tell the police.”
“They were holding my hand when I was talking to the police at my job,” Nourn recalls. “They encouraged me, they supported me, they helped me make that call.” She remembers being taken to the police station and interrogated for 10 hours.
“I didn’t do anything wrong. I just wanted to seek their help and protection,” Nourn says. The next day, she discovered both she and Barker were each charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors characterised the homicide as a premeditated attack, with Nourn complicit in luring Stevens to his death.
At age 22, Nourn was given a life sentence without the possibility of parole. In handing down the sentence, San Diego judge Frederic Link asserted that Nourn was even more culpable than Barker himself.
“She took this mad dog and led him to the victim in this case,” Link said, according to media reports. “She let him off the leash.” He described Nourn as a “selfish, cold-blooded killer”. She was sent to the Central California Women’s Facility, the largest women’s prison in the state.
“My background being Southeast Asian and a young woman, coming from a poor family and not educated — I didn’t understand that those were factors, especially my co-defendant being Asian and my victim being white,” Nourn says in hindsight.

Eventual deportation
But prison proved to be a turning point for Nourn.
All around her, she met women with similar experiences, similar stories, similar backgrounds. Many were domestic violence survivors. It was eye-opening. Even her bunkmate was a survivor, incarcerated after pleading guilty to murdering an abusive boyfriend. An older Black woman, she offered Nourn a shower puff on her first day as a welcoming gift: it had a little animal face sewn into its centre. Nourn still smiles at the thought of it. Having just arrived, Nourn had little of her own, and the smiling shower puff was silly but practical.
Estimates vary as to how many incarcerated women in the US have experienced domestic or sexual violence in their past, but one 1999 study placed the rate as high as 94 percent.
“When you think about who’s locked up, who’s incarcerated, who is serving life for whatever conviction, you can’t imagine an Asian woman, right?” Nourn asks.
She points to stereotypes like the model minority myth, which associates Asians with success, not violence and incarceration.
“You expect someone that’s tatted-up, that has a history of being locked up, being arrested, that used drugs, stuff like that. People that are like gang members. You don’t expect to see women, victims of domestic violence, survivors, being criminalised also.”
In 2006, an appeals court in California reviewed Nourn’s case, citing the fact that her defence failed to investigate the role of “battered women’s syndrome” in justifying her actions on the night of the murder. Pioneered in the 1970s, concepts like “battered women’s syndrome” are increasingly used to explain the psychology of abuse survivors — particularly when they themselves are forced to participate in a crime, like lethal self-defence.
“She was denied her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel,” the appeals court concluded. Nourn’s sentence was adjusted to a term of 15 years to life. Rather than spend the rest of her life in jail, she could be free by the time she reached her late 30s.
But Nourn hadn’t factored in one thing: her status as a refugee. “Coming to the United States as a permanent resident, with legal status, I thought I had the same rights as any other citizen,” she says with a shrug. It came as a shock to learn she might be deported upon release.
At first, Nourn was in denial. “No, that’s not true,” she insisted to a friend from Thailand she met in prison, who tried to warn her about the possibility of deportation. Nourn hadn’t realised she would be subject to the Criminal Alien Program, a system used by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to identify and deport non-citizens in the criminal justice system.
As of 2020, 90 percent of individuals targeted by ICE for “enforcement and removal” were non-citizens with criminal convictions or pending charges. In other words, Nourn’s case was not unusual. Anoop Prasad, a senior attorney at San Francisco’s Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus, receives a dozen letters from individuals like her every week.
So when Nourn wrote to the law caucus in 2013, it seemed like just another letter in the pile.
Prasad responded with the truth: that her options were limited. There was little he could do to stop her eventual deportation.
“Up to that point, I think only one person who had been sentenced to LWOP [Life Without Parole] had left a California prison alive. And no one with an ICE hold that we knew with LWOP had beat deportation,” Prasad explains.
A new side to immigrant rights
Today’s system of deportation was forged, in part, thanks to a suite of laws passed in 1996, under then-President Bill Clinton. Chief among them was the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996, which expanded the number of crimes that made immigrants eligible for deportation.
The law also stripped away the ability of immigration judges to exercise discretion in deportation cases. As Prasad wrote in his letter back to Nourn, the law prohibited judges from considering her history as a child arrival or her status as a refugee. It didn’t even matter that Nourn had never been to Cambodia, the country she would be deported to.
Nourn knew her chances of evading deportation were low, even before she received Prasad’s response confirming as much. But she was determined to persevere.
“If the system figured out a way to put me in here, I knew that there’s a way to get me out,” she says. She credits her fellow prisoners with inspiring her persistence. One woman told her she lives not only for herself and her family but to prove that incarceration is not final — something Nourn took to heart.
So she doubled down and kept on writing. And Prasad soon found himself in a lively correspondence with Nourn. “What struck me was just how persistent Ny was. She was just not willing to accept that deportation was inevitable,” he recalls. “Basically for four years, she was nudging us.”
Even more astounding was the fact that Nourn had started lobbying him to represent other women she met in prison too — women who likewise faced ICE detention.
“Even though I hadn’t yet committed to actually taking this on, Ny was already connecting me with and pushing me to take on representation for other folks,” Prasad says. Her organising efforts left Prasad impressed. Her hope started to give him hope.
Still, Prasad had to contend with public sentiment. Even in the immigrant rights movement, he found there was little sympathy for people with criminal backgrounds.
“For much of the last several decades, the immigrant rights movement has tried to focus on this model of respectability, showing immigrants as being law-abiding, hardworking, English-speaking,” Prasad explains.
“There was no blueprint for an advocacy campaign for someone with a murder conviction and who once had a ‘life without parole’ sentence.”

Need for protection
For Kham Moua, the director of national policy at the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC), the complexity of Nourn’s case illustrates how even the most serious criminal offenses deserve consideration before deportation. His organisation advocates on behalf of individuals like Nourn to change federal law and protect immigrants from penalties like mandatory detention and deportation.
“What we’re looking for is not to remove accountability from the actions and the mistakes that these folks made, but to give them the sorts of protections that really any other American has — to give them the ability to redeem themselves legally without facing deportation as a consequence,” Moua says.
He argues that the 1996 immigration laws were hastily passed, without proper consideration of their wide-ranging effects. Not only did seemingly minor crimes — like drug possession and shoplifting — become cause for deportation, but the laws were retroactive. Any non-citizen with a criminal record in their past could be vulnerable. And if a family lost its breadwinner to deportation, the entire household risked spiraling into poverty.
“I think politicians forget that the 1996 laws — IIRIRA in particular — was passed as part of an omnibus. That bill wasn’t passed as a standalone bill. There wasn’t a tonne of time to take it into consideration,” Moua explains.
He estimates that more than 17,000 Southeast Asian Americans have been subject to orders of removal since the 1996 laws passed. Moua identifies closely with that community. Like Nourn, he was born in a Thai refugee camp, his parents having fled Laos during the horrors of the Vietnam War. His family joined the 1.2 million Southeast Asian refugees who have resettled in the United States in the decades since.
“For refugees and for Southeast Asians in particular, we’re here and our communities are here because the US supported armed conflicts or was directly involved in our countries,” Moua says. “Many of these folks, for all intents and purposes, are Americans. People like myself have never known any other country.”
Nourn too had never known any home but the United States. And yet, as her date with the parole board loomed nearer, Prasad, her attorney, held little hope that she could escape deportation.
“I didn’t tell her this, but in the back of my mind, I was also coming up with contingency plans for how to support Ny if she did get deported to Cambodia,” he says. Prasad knew conditions in Cambodia could be challenging, especially for a newcomer with few language skills and no support system to rely on. He had seen cases like hers end with clients stranded an ocean away, deported to a country of which they knew very little.

‘Strip people of their humanity’
Nourn’s parole hearing arrived in January 2017. And sure enough, her parole was approved. But as soon as the prison released her from custody, ICE agents were on hand to shackle her and drive her to the Yuba County Jail.
Prasad remembers receiving Nourn’s prison file after her transfer to ICE. It contained what’s called a “body receipt” — the term used for the paperwork used to document the transfer. “It was literally a receipt for her body,” Prasad says with emotion rising in his voice. “I feel like the system does everything it can to strip people of their humanity.”
Nourn’s new surroundings felt even more hopeless than before. In prison, she had routines, friends and the freedom to work, cook and socialise. She had a community. But in ICE detention she felt isolated, awash in an atmosphere of despair. Stuck in a “module” of 18 bunk beds, Nourn watched as her fellow bunkmates faced their deportations with little cause for hope.
Her chances of ever being set free were slim. Her only interactions with the outside world came in 30-minute increments, across glass dividers.
Still, Nourn kept busy. She gave media interviews, called into panel discussions and led campaign calls to map out a strategy for herself and others. Prasad remembers that it was like having an extra member on her defence team.
She was also keeping up correspondences with outside supporters. One of those letters came from a young man named Nate Tan. Born in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1990s to survivors of the Cambodian genocide, Tan had grown up struggling to relate to his Cambodian heritage, just as Nourn had.
“Anytime you bring up Cambodian anywhere, the initial thought is always the genocide, in any US context,” Tan says. He also noticed his peers associated Cambodian people with poverty and gangs. “So in that regard, it was hard for me to find any positive attributions of being Cambodian.”
As a child, Tan observed his parents contending with post-traumatic stress. They had night terrors. Poverty forced them to move from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. And when a notice went out to all parents that an active shooter was on campus at Tan’s school, his parents came running.
“My parents were blowing up my phone: ‘Are you safe? Are you safe?’” Tan thinks that, after losing so many loved ones to genocide, their fear of losing their children was all the greater.
Tan’s first brush with the criminal justice system came when he was in middle school. His younger brother, fearing bullies, had brought a knife to campus. That afternoon, the police arrived at Tan’s house, handcuffed his little brother and placed him in a holding cell at the local precinct.

Hope in the Cambodian American community
Early experiences like that inspired Tan to get involved with the Asian Prisoner Support Committee in college. The committee was offering ethnic studies programmes inside prisons like San Quentin State Prison, and Tan signed on. “I’ve probably met more Cambodian people in prison than I have ever,” Tan says emphatically.
He remembers that, on his first day visiting the prison, a man came up to welcome him: “You’re Cambodian? I’m Cambodian!” They grew close, and Tan was excited to learn he was soon due for parole.
But when the parole date came, rather than be released, the man was transferred to ICE detention. “That’s when I knew there was another system ready to inflict another form of violence on my community,” Tan says. “To me, it was a shock.”
Learning about Ny’s story through the activist community, though, gave him hope. It gave him pride. And it came at a time when deportations were at a historic high: in the early years of Donald Trump’s presidency, from 2017 to 2018, deportations of Cambodians alone leapt 279 percent.
Supporters crowded Nourn’s court hearings and celebrated her birthday with a sit-in at the local ICE office. Other incarcerated women were following her lead. Meanwhile, attorney Melanie Kim had joined the team at Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus, and together, she and Prasad were exploring novel ways to scuttle Nourn’s deportation.
One strategy involved filing a Convention Against Torture application on Nourn’s behalf, arguing that her life would be endangered by deportation. The other option they pursued was applying for a pardon from California’s governor — a solution that seemed too unlikely to come true.
“When we first started thinking about pardons as an option, pardons were so rare — and pardons to stop deportations were not a thing that really happened,” Prasad says.

‘Freedom on the other side’
But even when her Convention Against Torture application was granted — protecting her from deportation — ICE appealed the decision. And in the interim, it refused to release Nourn.
On November 9, 2017, Prasad entered a California courtroom to argue for Nourn to be released on bond. He was touched to see the courtroom flooded with her supporters: “A lot of lifers, a lot of folks who had spent time in ICE, people who had done time with Ny, were all in the courtroom, which was just really amazing to see.”
When a judge granted Nourn her bond, Prasad was stunned. “I was still a little bit in a state of shock,” he said. “We just needed to post the bond, and she would be out that day.”
That outcome seemed so unlikely, he and Kim hadn’t even thought to prepare clothes for Nourn.
As they drove to Yuba County Jail to pick her up, Nourn was enjoying her first taste of freedom in 16 years. ICE had already released her into the waiting area, where she could see a door to the outside world. There were no chains. No locks. No barriers. Nothing to cage her inside.
“You could just step out, and that’s freedom on the other side,” she recalls. It felt like a novelty to climb into the backseat of a car without chains wrapped around her waist.
Three years later, in 2020, Nourn herself was working as a community advocate at the Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus. She was on her way to a workshop when her attorney — now colleague — Prasad surprised her with the news: the governor of California, Democrat Gavin Newsom, had used his executive powers to grant her a full pardon.
Her first reaction was disbelief: “I’m getting what!?” Pardon applications can take years to process, and typically applicants are only notified if the governor chooses to take action.
Shock washed over Nourn, then joy. With the governor’s pardon, Nourn had protection that no court could overturn — a scenario she faced with her Convention Against Torture application. The Convention Against Torture decision also left her vulnerable to deportation to another country outside of Cambodia.
But the pardon had the power to end deportation proceedings, by addressing the original grounds for her removal: her crime. Nourn no longer had to fear deportation for what happened in 1998. She would no longer have to worry about being separated from her family, being forced to leave the only country she had never known.
Crying and shaking, Nourn called her mother and her siblings to share the news. Her phone started buzzing with messages of congratulations from her well-wishers.
After receiving the paper pardon certificate in the mail, Nourn took to Twitter. “Thank you @GavinNewsom,” she wrote, before asking that he please “grant mass clemency for more people to free them from ICE detentions, prisons, & fear of deportation!”
As of 2022, Newsom’s office has granted 112 pardons total, including to Cambodian refugees like Kang Hen and Hay Hov, whose pardons in 2019 were seen as a rebuke to the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Nourn and other advocates continue to fight for a new law that would prevent state and local governments in California from assisting with ICE deportations.

Fighting the deportation machine
Today, Nourn organises on behalf of Survived and Punished, a grassroots group that campaigns to free survivors of domestic violence enmeshed in the criminal justice system. She also got to meet Tan, her former pen pal.
Tan admits to being “a little star-struck” when meeting her in person for the first time. “In the Cambodian community, every so often you hear a story about someone reconnecting with someone they lost during the genocide,” Tan explains. “When I saw Ny, even though I didn’t know Ny before her incarceration, it felt like I was meeting her in a long-lost reunion.”
They now co-direct the Asian Prisoner Support Committee together, which runs prison and re-entry programmes as well as campaigns against deportation. It’s the same organisation that first got Tan volunteering in San Quentin State Prison. Given that the vast majority of prisoners in the United States are men — at a rate of 93.4 percent as of March — Tan says Nourn’s example is all the more powerful for giving voice to a female minority that can feel invisible.

“I have seen so many incarcerated women fight the deportation machine so fiercely, modeling after what Ny did,” Tan says. “There’s a disproportionate amount of support for men. Women do not nearly get the same support. But Ny has really brought forward this fight for incarcerated women.”
Tan knows it’s easy to hate the system that incarcerates so many. It’s easy to be angry. But as far as he can tell, Nourn hasn’t gotten into advocacy out of spite. She does this work out of love for her community: for the abuse survivors whose lives are derailed by violence. For the immigrants doubly punished through prison and deportation.
“She has this deep love for people who have been in situations like hers,” Tan says.
Though she no longer lives with shackles and bars, Nourn insists she doesn’t feel free — not yet at least. “We’re only free until everyone is free,” she says. That’s why she continues to share her story, working for that day to finally come.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Women-you-should-have-heard-of-Ny-Noum.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the children there are experiencing the devastating consequences of living in a war zone – the constant threat of shelling, shooting and losing loved ones, as well as the worry over accessing food, clean drinking water and healthcare, and the breakdown of their usual routines and structures.

The mental health impact of this is likely to have consequences for years to come.
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are the most common mental health disorders in the aftermath of war – for both adults and children. While the incidences of these disorders are difficult to estimate, most studies have found significantly raised levels of disturbance compared with control populations. For example, past studies of newly arrived refugee children show rates of anxiety from 49 percent to 69 percent, with prevalence dramatically increasing if at least one parent had been tortured or if families were separated.
PTSD can occur in children after even a single traumatic event, but repeated or prolonged trauma increases the risk. The symptoms of PTSD vary; sufferers may show intense fear, helplessness, anger, sadness, horror or denial. They can also develop physical symptoms including headaches and stomach aches; show more sudden and extreme emotional reactions; or have problems falling or staying asleep. Children who experience repeated trauma may develop a kind of emotional numbing to deaden or block the pain and trauma. This is called dissociation.
Depression can occur in children as young as three years old – they can feel sad or hopeless, or show disinterest in things they used to enjoy. Their sleep patterns and energy levels may change, and some may even self-harm.
How a child’s mental health is affected will depend to a large extent on the support they receive from their caregivers. But this, too, becomes difficult during times of war as normal attachments are frequently disrupted. Some children could lose their caregivers, be separated from them as some members of the family flee and others stay behind to fight, or find that their caregivers are themselves too depressed or anxious or too preoccupied with protecting and finding subsistence for the family to be fully emotionally available.
For children, the detrimental effects of war trauma are not restricted to specific mental health diagnoses but also include a broad and multifaceted set of developmental outcomes that compromise relationships, school performance and general life satisfaction. This is exacerbated by the fact that violent conflict often destroys or significantly damages schools and educational systems. Without the structure offered by schools, children will need the adults in their lives to provide this; we have seen videos online of Ukrainian children in underground bunkers where adults are facilitating lessons and designated playtimes.
It isn’t just loved ones and routines children may be separated from. Many will have to flee their homes at short notice, leaving behind their treasured possessions, such as a specific ‘attachment object’ – usually a favourite blanket or a soft toy. Children often reach for these things when they need to feel safe. But during war, when children are forced to flee and need these objects more than ever, many are left without them.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

For many Ukrainian children, leaving their homes will also mean leaving their country. Displaced children, especially refugees, are more vulnerable to experiencing psychological issues. They also encounter additional risk factors and could be exposed to different forms of exploitation.
Studies have shown that children are particularly sensitive to an accumulation of stressors; in fact, there is considerable evidence for a dose‐response relation between the number of stressors experienced by children and their mental health outcomes. For child refugees, the accumulation of stress generally comes from three main contributors:

In their native countries, many may have witnessed or experienced violence, torture and the loss of family and friends.
The journey to a country of refuge can also be a time of further stress. Refugee children may experience separation from their parents, either by accident or as a strategy to ensure their safety.
The final stage of finding respite in another country can be a time of additional difficulty as many have to prove their asylum claims and also try to integrate into a new society. This period is being increasingly referred to as a period of “secondary trauma” to highlight the problems encountered. On arriving, a refugee child will need to settle into a new school and find a peer group. Children might have to prematurely assume adult roles, for example, as a vital language link with the outside world.

Refugee children suffer both from the effects of coming from a war zone and of adjusting to an unfamiliar culture. These stressors also affect their families which in turn has an adverse effect on them. And the longer wars go on, the worse it is for children.
Longitudinal studies, during which children are examined at different points of their lives, tend to show these mental health issues persist over time, while also creating increased susceptibility to other psychological issues. Adolescents with cumulative exposure to war and those with PTSD resulting from war events have been found to have significantly higher rates of substance abuse. Children who have witnessed war and conflict have higher rates of depression and anxiety long into adulthood. Specifically, the prolonged activation of stress hormones in early childhood can reduce neural connections in areas of the brain dedicated to learning and reasoning, affecting children’s abilities to perform later in their lives. In this way, conflict imposes a huge social cost on future generations.
It is crucial that children are quickly integrated into the schools and healthcare systems of the countries they have taken refuge in. They will need emotional and psychological support from cross-cultural teams who can work in an extended outreach manner with children at schools and families at home. There is a need for a variety of different treatments, including individual, family, group and school-based interventions. Schools are uniquely placed to play a vital part in their integration by becoming an anchor, not only for educational but also for social and emotional development, and as an essential link between children, their parents and the local community.
Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan: Children of war
Of course, children are caught up in conflicts in other parts of the world as well.
After more than a decade of conflict in Syria, UNICEF says every child there has been affected by the violence, displacement, severed family ties and lack of access to vital services caused by the massive physical devastation of the war.
Almost 13,000 children have been killed and injured since the beginning of the conflict. Meanwhile, a severe economic crisis, mass displacement, widely devastated public service infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have left 6.5 million children requiring humanitarian assistance.
For many Syrian children, war is all they have ever known, and the perpetual threat of violence and hunger has had profound effects on their mental health. The war has also brought on one of the largest education crises in recent history. As places where children get together with peers, become competent members of society, and find consistent social support, schools can help them cope with trauma. However, Syria’s education facilities are overstretched, and many schools cannot be used because they have been destroyed or damaged or are being used to shelter displaced families or for military purposes. By March 2022, more than three million Syrian children were out of school.
In Yemen, children are also suffering in what can only be described as a humanitarian disaster. At least 10,200 children have been killed or maimed since the war began, thousands have been recruited to fight, and two million are internally displaced. The damage and closure of schools and hospitals have also disrupted access to education and health services, leaving them even more vulnerable. The most urgent crisis in Yemen is hunger. It will come as no surprise that children who are persistently hungry and malnourished have higher incidences of stress, anxiety, depression and even schizophrenia. More than two million Yemeni children are out of school, but even those who still have access to educational facilities will have reduced learning and productivity due to nutritional deficiencies that directly undermine their cognitive capacities and ability to learn.
The children of Afghanistan have witnessed or experienced poverty, malnutrition, violence and death consistently. A large proportion of children in Afghanistan suffer from depression and anxiety but lack access to vital support services to help them. A staggering two-thirds of parents surveyed in parts of Afghanistan said their children were scared of explosions, kidnappings or other forms of extreme violence on their journeys to and from school, according to a 2019 report by Save the Children. And now, secondary schools have been closed to girls.
How to speak to children about the war in Ukraine
For many of us in the rest of the world, the challenges and horrors children and their families face in places of conflict are unimaginable, and our natural reaction is to want to protect our own children from being exposed to the grim reality of what is going on.
But the news cycles have been heavy with updates about Ukraine and with young people talking in playgrounds and having access to social media, many of them will inevitably have seen some of the harrowing images and read some of the stories, and they will ask questions. So what is the best way to speak to children about the war in Ukraine?
Children are good at picking up on the anxieties of adults, so if we are anxious or stressed about what is going on in Ukraine, they will know something is wrong. They have also suffered the stress of two years of living through a pandemic and many of their routines – so crucial for children’s mental health – were disrupted.
The timing may be bad, but age-appropriate honesty is the best policy. Anxiety can manifest itself in a number of ways in children, depending on their age. Younger children may have non-specific tummy aches, difficulty sleeping, show behavioural changes, become clingier and can even wet the bed. Older children may have symptoms similar to adults, showing mood and behavioural changes and becoming more withdrawn and unable to enjoy the things they once did.
Ask children what they already know and whether they have any questions for you. Give them time to talk about how they are feeling and what is worrying them. Validate their feelings by acknowledging them and saying it is okay to feel this way given the circumstances. Do not tell them that you are feeling anxious or worried too; this must be their time and adults must not project their emotions onto them.
Explain what is being done to remedy the situation in Ukraine; that adults are working hard to resolve the conflict. Tell them about all the work that is being done to help refugees, including the charities that are helping to distribute donations and how generous people are being in supporting refugees by inviting them to stay in their homes. Ask them if they would like to do anything to help – they may want to donate some things such as their toys or make a poster about world peace – being proactive may help children deal with some of their anxieties.
It is tough, and you know your children best – some may want lots of information while others may simply want a hug or to play a game to take their mind off things. But do not think of it as a one-off conversation; if your child needs to revisit the topic and talk more, be prepared for this. You are there to listen and it’s important they know this. It is okay for them to feel worried about what is going on, but they are children and need to know it is still okay to play, have fun and enjoy life.
Children have been the innocent victims in so many conflicts. What they see, hear and feel will have long-term consequences for them as they develop into adults. Many organisations are doing what they can to help protect and support children during times of war, but it is hard and, inevitably, many children will suffer. Food, water and disease become issues, all of which hit the most vulnerable the hardest. And even after conflicts end, families are scattered and broken, economies destroyed and neighbourhoods obliterated. Some say there are no easy answers, rather naively I would say there is, to use diplomacy over violence.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Doctors-note-mental-health.png?resize=770%2C513"

But for Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, there is an added dimension given its military relationships with all the major actors, especially Russia.
Historically, both countries have explored areas of defence cooperation and the arms trade. One of the side plots of the longrunning Cold War era was that during Nigeria’s 30-month-long civil war that ended in 1970, the Soviet Union extended military assistance.
Only last year, Abuja signed an agreement with Moscow for the supply of military equipment, personnel training and technology transfer.
The outcome of that deal has become increasingly visible since, given the acquisition and use of Russian-made combat and transport helicopters like the Mi-35M and Mi-171E, both export variants of the Russian Mi-24 and Mi-8, for military operations in Nigeria.
But since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the gains from the relationship may be eroding.
The West has responded to the crisis with a rollout of lethal military support, including anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles to NATO countries near Ukraine, like Poland. A barrage of sanctions has also been directed at individuals and entities in Russia. On March 24, the United States announced sanctions on multiple firms in Russia’s defence-industrial sector, some whose weapons are being used in the invasion.
The new sanctions and financial restrictions which align with previous actions and those taken by the European Union, United Kingdom and Canada, are designed to have a deep and long-lasting effect on the Russian defence sector.
They will prevent Russia’s access to cutting-edge technologies and inevitably disrupt supply chains and production, particularly for targeted defence companies such as Russian Helicopters JSC.
This, in turn, will affect their capacity to provide efficient maintenance support and additional aircraft to foreign customers, including the Nigerian Air Force.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

The Nigerian military is currently wrestling with persistent domestic conflicts on multiple fronts including uprisings in the northeast by Boko Haram and the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP), banditry in the northwest as well as increasingly violent separatist rebellions in the southeast.
It is also battling maritime piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the world’s most dangerous shipping routes.
Without its Russian arms supply, Nigeria’s firepower will severely lag.

A punctured supply chain
Russia is the world’s second-largest arms exporter, behind the US.
Between 2017 to 2021, it was notably the largest supplier to Africa, accounting for 44 percent of imports of major arms to the continent, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which tracks the international arms trade.
Its 2021 report reveals that Nigeria received arms from 13 suppliers in the same five-year period, including 272 armoured vehicles from China, seven combat helicopters from Russia, three combat aircraft from Pakistan, and 12 light combat aircraft from Brazil through the US.
Over the past decade, Russian combat and transport rotary aircraft equipped with modern technological systems and sensors have become an integral element of Nigeria’s bid to expand its Air Force’s fighting capabilities.
But the delivery of more units of Mi-35M gunships suitable for close air support missions has already been marred by controversy. In 2019, the Nigerian ambassador to Russia hinted at a brick wall in the supply chain – a fallout from pre-existing sanctions.
Two years earlier, the US had signed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) directed at puncturing the pipeline of arms exports after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, involvement in the Syrian civil war and meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections.
In its 2022 budget, the Nigerian government has made provisions for periodic depot maintenance and the upgrade of three older MI helicopters. The Mi-24V and Mi-35P variants are known to be used by the Air Force.
A few years ago, Russian Helicopters JSC launched upgrades for the Mi-35P variant including an improved target sight system, digital flight control system and night vision goggles.
Those would be perfect for Nigeria’s counterinsurgency operations against increasingly sophisticated armed groups within and around its borders. But the stream of new sanctions aimed at the Russian defence sector creates hurdles for Nigeria’s upgrade plans.
Belarus trained the AFSF
The sanctions are also extending to Russian ally Belarus which continues to provide support for Russia’s attack on Ukraine.
That support could endanger military cooperation between Nigeria and Belarus, which hosted the 2014 training of Nigeria’s elite tactical unit, the Armed Forces Special Forces (AFSF). The AFSF was formed as part of revamping the Nigerian military’s response to the escalating threat from Boko Haram.
There have been rumours of other planned deployments but nothing has been confirmed, except for a visit by the chief of one of Nigeria’s civil defence corps and top officials of the interior ministry to Minsk last August.
Ukrainian tanks, artillery and armoured personnel carriers
The war is also draining Ukraine’s military hardware manufacturing and export capacity and that could hurt Nigeria, too.
Between 2014 and 2015, Nigeria acquired military equipment from Ukraine including T-72 tanks, D-30 artillery, and BTR-4EN armoured personnel carriers before increasingly turning to China for assets.
(Al Jazeera)
New markets
All of that could push Abuja towards finding new markets for alternative helicopters able to carry out similar roles as effectively as its Russian ones, requiring new investments to build technical capacity and support infrastructure.
Still, there could be other political hurdles.
Last July, the US bipartisan Senate Foreign Relations Committee halted the proposed sale of 12 AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters and accompanying systems worth $875m to Nigeria, amid concerns about the government’s human rights record.
Nigeria’s information minister denied knowledge of the situation but his foreign affairs counterpart, Godfrey Onyeama, was more forthcoming. “We have a slight issue with some attack helicopters, but that’s more on the legislative side and not on the executive side,” said Onyeama during a meeting last year between US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and Nigerian officials in Abuja.
The short and long-term effects of the invasion of Ukraine and the continuous flow of sanctions provide new opportunities for collaborations with Nigeria, once reputed for its professional army standards and willingness to engage in international peacekeeping missions across Africa.
For now, that could also mean increased arms trade with China – the fifth-largest arms exporter globally – given the West’s reluctance, despite differences in quality, operationality and technical support.
In 2019, General Stephen Townsend, then a nominee for the position of commander, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), informed the US Senate Armed Services Committee that China provided Nigeria with armed unmanned aerial systems to improve its counterterrorism capabilities, but poor quality contributed to their infrequent use.
But the following year, Nigeria’s air force acquired a number of drones including the Chinese Wing Loong II drones which resemble the American MQ-9 Reaper drones. While the MQ-9 Reaper is reported to cost $30m, the Wing Loong II costs $1-2m.
These drones are known to lack the sophistication and technical capacity of their Western counterparts but without much of a choice, African countries could soon turn to them.
China’s relatively affordable and accessible military hardware could easily appeal to countries like Nigeria and states across the Sahel seeking alternative markets for assets acquisition.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/000_19O2PX.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

One third of this increase is projected to happen in just three countries — China, Nigeria and India. Yet, as urban populations grow, a big part of society continues to be marginalised and excluded — people with disabilities.
Unlike any other marginalised group, anyone can become a member of the disability community at any point in their life. People can develop a physical disability because of an accident, illness, or simply, old age.

Out of the more than one billion people globally with some form of disability, 80 percent live in the developing world.
Mumbai, India’s financial and entertainment capital, is home to more than 12.5 million people.
According to the 2011 census, in the western state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, about 2.6 percent of the population lives with a disability. The true number, however, is believed to be much higher due to underreporting by census and government workers and the stigma around disability.
People with disabilities in Mumbai face numerous obstacles when it comes to accessibility and mobility.
The city’s streets are some of the busiest in the world, and overcrowding, flooding and poorly maintained infrastructure make it incredibly hard for people with disabilities to access the city’s public transport system.
So what does it mean to live in Mumbai, one of the world’s megacities, with a disability?

Getting around Mumbai – a snapshot
The local commuter train system in Mumbai is the oldest in Asia and was inaugurated in 1853. Today, more than 7.5 million people use this transport system daily. It is inexpensive to use and is one of the world’s biggest and busiest commuter train networks.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.

Throughout the years, however, the system has not kept up with the growing number of commuters. Today, on average, the trains are packed at 2.6 times their capacity. With such a strain on the system, accidents are frequent with people falling off packed trains, getting hit while crossing the tracks or even dying in stampedes. The gaps between the train and the platform can be dangerously wide.
These dangers prevent people with disabilities from relying on this popular option. And those who brave the crowds and overcome other accessibility issues, such as steep ramps or a lack of elevators, for example, often find the reserved compartments for people with disabilities filled with regular commuters.
Mumbai also has a public bus system which is marginally accessible. The system is well connected with more than 400 routes across the city, and buses have designated seats for passengers with disabilities, for example, 3 seats are reserved in the double-decker buses with a seating capacity of 90 passengers.

However, accessibility remains an issue. As of December 2020, less than 7 percent of public buses in the country were fully accessible for wheelchair users – with the provision of ramps, reserved space for wheelchairs and digital and audio announcements for stops – according to the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry’s Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.
Other transport options in Mumbai are the iconic kaali-peeli (black and yellow) taxis, or for shorter commutes, auto-rickshaws. The presence of private taxi companies Ola Cabs and Uber has grown and they have launched auto-rickshaw services of their own.
However, these modes of transport are too expensive for most people to use daily, while the app-based services are inaccessible for those without smartphones. In addition, drivers and other workers employed with taxi services are often not adequately trained to assist people with disabilities.
​​To address the lack of accessibility in Mumbai, several startups have launched mobility initiatives.
For example, in 2019, Ravindra Singh, who was diagnosed with post-polio paralysis when he was eight months old, started myUDAAN, an on-demand wheelchair service. Through the app, users can book assistants, buy mobility products, and check accessible places. Wheelchair taxi and ambulance services such as EzyMov, started in 2015, and MobiCab, launched in 2016, were set up for people with disabilities, but due to their prices, are only accessible to wealthier users. For example, a train ticket costs about 5 Indian rupees ($0.07) while the base fare for a service like EzyMov can cost about 60 times that price.

Slow progress for a more accessible India
In December 2015, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Accessible India Campaign. The campaign focuses on developing an “accessible physical environment, transportation system and Information & communication ecosystem”.
Among its aims was making 25 percent of public buses fully accessible by 2018, but with progress falling behind schedule, this deadline has been extended to June 2022. Likewise, its goal of making at least 50 percent of government buildings accessible to people with disabilities in the national capital, New Delhi, as well as in each state capital by May 2018 was not met. More than two years after the campaign launched, only 3 percent of buildings had become accessible.
In March 2021, the government launched the Sugamya Bharat mobile app, a nationwide crowdsourcing platform to address the issues faced by people with disabilities in public spaces. Users can register accessibility-related concerns or provide positive feedback as well as receive public health-related information. But out of the 360 complaints forwarded to the authorities responsible for taking action, just 26 were resolved by September 2021.

Inaccessible Cities: Mumbai
Making cities such as Mumbai better accessible for people of all abilities is the first step towards true equity and inclusion.
Without options to freely and independently travel around and access public spaces in a city like Mumbai, people with disabilities remain marginalised. They lack access to education, healthcare, employment, housing and systems of social protection. They face stigma, discrimination and even violence.
To make Mumbai more accessible, survey-taking must become more accurate, gaps between trains and platforms should be reduced and more should be done to meet mobility and building access targets.
For women with disabilities, access in Mumbai is also connected to protection against sexual violence. According to Nidhi Goyal, a blind comedian and disability rights activist, helpful Mumbaikars is what makes the city slightly more accessible. However, this means that as a person with a disability you have to fully trust the stranger. As an activist, Nidhi has encountered many reports from blind women who were groped or harassed when being helped.

For many, these cities sustain an ideal way of life with essential services, grocery stores, hospitals, offices and cultural attractions often just a few blocks away. But for people with disabilities, life in a big city is often a different story.
More than one billion people – approximately 15 percent of the global population – experience some form of disability.

By 2050, some 68 percent of the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas, up from today’s 55 percent. And as the world’s urban areas grow, there is an urgent need for cities to adapt to the needs of disabled people to ensure they are not marginalised and excluded.
Unlike any other marginalised group, anyone can become a member of the disability community at any point in their life. People can develop a physical disability because of an accident, illness, or simply, old age.
New York City, one of the world’s largest and most diverse cities, is considered by some to be one of the least accessible in the United States when it comes to public transportation.
So what is it like today to live in New York City with a disability?
Most of the subway stations in New York City are accessible only via stairs [Alexey Yurenev/Al Jazeera]
Subway shortcomings
The city’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) subway and bus system is well-connected and operates round-the-clock, making travel opportunities seem endless, but for the 550,000 New Yorkers who have difficulty walking, using this system to get around the Big Apple is not so appealing. Of 472 active subway stations, for example, fewer than a quarter are equipped with elevators.
According to TransitCenter, a US nonprofit organisation working towards more just and environmentally sustainable transit, that means a person who can navigate stairs can enjoy a total of 222,312 station-to-station trips while a person who requires an elevator can access only 11,990, or 5 percent, of the total possible trips.
The opportunities for a disabled person to travel are further reduced when considering the length of time that elevators spend out of service. The worst offender, 161st Street-Yankee Stadium station, is down 111 days of the year.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

I live in New York City with cerebral palsy and use a motorised wheelchair to travel long distances for safety and time-efficiency reasons. During my undergraduate university years, I lived on campus in upper Manhattan, the most metropolitan of the city’s five boroughs and travelled 20 blocks to get to the nearest accessible subway station. Each time, I’d hope it was a good day and the elevator would be operational.
On different occasions, I’d find myself stuck on a subway station with a broken elevator. In such situations, I had two options. I could wait for a kind stranger to help me carry my 27kg chair up flights of stairs. Alternatively, I could get back on the train and ride it to the next closest station with an accessible lift, which could be as many as a dozen stops away, and then either take the bus or ride the subway from the opposite track back to my destination in the hopes that side would have a functioning elevator. New York subway stations tend to have different elevators for people going downtown and going uptown.

Subway inequality
The MTA aims to make New York City’s subway system, the city’s central nervous system which runs on 100-year-old technology, completely disability accessible by 2034. At present, 25 percent is accessible.
Making the subway fully accessible will enable people with disabilities to better access essential buildings like hospitals and schools and allow them to be more included in society.
Accessibility is also crucial for tackling socioeconomic inequalities. New Yorkers with disabilities are more than twice as likely to live in poverty (36.5 percent) as those without disabilities (16.6 percent). A lack of transportation options is one of the most significant barriers to employment for New Yorkers with disabilities, according to a 2019 report from the Office of the New York State Comptroller.
Manhattan is the least affordable borough and is also heavily serviced by the subway compared with the city’s other boroughs where there is the issue of “transit deserts” — areas where one would need to walk more than 10 minutes to get to a subway station — and fewer nearby accessible stations.
Giving underserved communities more access to transportation is, therefore, a crucial step in allowing them to lift themselves out of poverty and access job opportunities.

MTA mobility: a work in progress
Since 1993, the MTA has managed Access-A-Ride, a public, city-wide network of vans and cars equipped with wheelchair lifts that drop passengers off at their destination within the city’s five boroughs for $2.75, the price of today’s subway ride, regardless of distance.
Passengers must schedule their ride one to two days in advance. If a ride is available, the passenger could wait up to 30 minutes from the scheduled departure time, however, the rider has only five minutes upon the van’s arrival to meet the driver before they leave.
If the passenger is not there, they are counted as a no-show and the driver leaves. As the fares are collected at the time of boarding, no-shows are not charged. But no-shows and late cancellations can lead to a temporary suspension from the programme.
Access-A-Ride services remain a convoluted and frustrating process for many of its users, including me.
In 2013, after moving to the city for university from my small town in New Jersey, I applied to join the programme. After months of waiting for approval to join, I finally got to book my first ride, only to be left stranded on the sidewalk for two hours before the driver showed up. By then, I had already missed the event I was supposed to attend.
The next time, I waited for the driver for nearly an hour. After one or two more attempts I stopped using the service altogether and avoided leaving campus, where I lived at the time, for about a year.
In 2017, Access-A-Ride launched the on-demand “e-hail” programme with taxi services that have wheelchair lifts. The service was a significant improvement over the previous setup because it allowed for real-time driver updating to assign new drivers to passengers if they were held up somewhere. Users of the programme can hail a taxi using the app and pay just the standard $2.75 fee.
As more people venture out using taxis rather than mass transit during the pandemic, there has been a shortage of taxis available through the e-hail initiative, meaning people with disabilities are facing wait times that are hours long, or rides are unavailable.
MTA buses are another transportation option.
While the transit agency touts its buses as “100% accessible to riders with disabilities” there are recurring issues. Bus drivers do not always know how to operate the ramps or lifts to board passengers with ambulatory disabilities. Even if the driver knows how to use the equipment, they need to be able to pull up to the curb to allow passengers with disabilities to safely get on and off the bus.
A lack of enforcement by the New York Police Department to stop cars pulling up at bus stops and no central city department responsible for clearing snow piles during winter can prevent drivers from getting close to the curb. This leaves people in wheelchairs stranded outside in the cold while others board the bus. Or they risk their safety when trying to drive their chairs either over the snow piles or into the busy road in an attempt to catch the bus.

Inaccessible cities: New York City
Making major cities such as New York City fully accessible is the first true step towards true equity and inclusion.
To make New York City more accessible, the MTA can start by ensuring that the subway elevators in place work consistently and that all MTA operators are trained to accommodate those with disabilities while law enforcement should better regulate curbs.
To highlight the struggles and social barriers people with disabilities face, and to show how these are issues that transcend borders, cultures and languages, we took a deep look into the state of accessibility through the lives of three women in different megacities.

Who’s in the race?
Prime Minister Viktor Orban is seeking a fourth consecutive term. His nationalist conservative Fidesz party has enjoyed a super-majority, allowing him to change the constitution, for much of the past 12 years.
Having moved steadily to the right, Orban has arranged to run a referendum on his anti-LGBTQ policies.

In the opposite corner stands United for Hungary – an awkward alliance of opposition parties including the far-right, the traditional left, greens, and liberals.
This alliance was designed, say the parties, to save the country from Orban’s increasingly corrupt and authoritarian rule.
Conservative independent Peter Marki-Zay was selected as the bloc’s candidate for prime minister in October.
What are the main campaign issues?
Fidesz planned the referendum as the centrepiece of its campaign to mobilise its conservative electorate.
It has also concentrated on linking the united opposition with figures such as American philanthropist George Soros and other members of what it says is a globalist liberal elite determined to destroy Hungary’s sovereignty, flood the country with migrants, introduce “gender madness“, and throw out Fidesz’s populist economic policies.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

United for Hungary, meanwhile, planned to concentrate on claims that Orban has organised a widespread network of corruption to steal European Union funds and rigged the justice and electoral systems to help him get away with it.

However, the war just across the border in Ukraine has overwhelmed all issues to dominate the campaign.
Orban is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest EU ally. Although the government has not blocked EU sanctions against Moscow, it has refused to reduce Hungary’s heavy reliance on Russian energy and refuses to let weapons headed to Ukraine transit the country.
United for Hungary has tried to turn the election into a referendum on whether Hungary should be part of the East or West.
It has also taken aim at the government’s populist economic policies, which include generous benefits and capped energy prices, claiming that the economic spillover from the war will make these policies unsustainable.
Fidesz has reacted by promoting Orban as a guarantor of peace and stability. The opposition has been branded warmongers for calling for stronger support for Ukraine and accused of planning austerity.
The opposition strategy is not working, said Mariann Ory, senior editor at pro-government daily Magyar Hirlap.
“Polls show that for most people the priority is to keep Hungary out of the war and protect its energy security,” she said.
Is the election race free and fair?
Many claim a free and fair election is not possible in Hungary.
It is estimated that under Orban’s rejigged election system the united opposition needs a margin of victory of at least 6 percent to secure a majority.
The control of the media landscape that Fidesz has built over the past 10 years or so is also an issue, say analysts, allowing the party to limit the narratives to which many voters are exposed.
“The ruling party’s campaign is more effective, because it has a machine dominating the public sphere,” said Robert Laszlo from Budapest-based think-tank Political Capital.
These worries have persuaded the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor the vote.
It has expressed concern not only over Fidesz’s domination of the media market but also the misuse of administrative resources, the blurring of state and political party roles, and campaign financing.
Local organisations, meanwhile, have raised an army of 20,000 volunteer poll observers.
But Fidesz spokesman Zoltan Kovacs says such action is unnecessary, and the result of bias against Orban’s illiberal views.
“It’s going to be a completely free election,” he told Al Jazeera. “The OSCE comes from a world that is against us.”
However, even the Fidesz-funded Center for Fundamental Rights admitted that the OSCE’s “sending of a full election monitoring mission [is] … an unprecedented step for an EU member state”.
What do the opinion polls say?
Amplified by his media machine, Orban’s narrative around the war in Ukraine appears to be working.
Even the efforts of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to push Budapest to show greater solidarity seem to have had little effect.
Fear of the war appears to be stronger in Hungary than anger at Putin’s aggression, say analysts. And as the pressure rises, United for Hungary’s unity and experience is being tested.
“The opposition needs to mobilise its electorate and change the narrative in the coming days,” said Milan Nic, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations.
Opinion polls in December last year suggested there was little to choose between Fidesz and the united opposition. But surveys taken since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suggest Fidesz has opened a small but potentially decisive lead of five points or more.
“I only see defeat,” a senior official from the United for Hungary told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. “Eighty seats would be a reasonable result for us. Fidesz won’t get another super-majority.”
Why do Hungary’s elections matter?
Despite Hungary’s small size, the election is being closely watched.
Although a member of the EU and NATO, under Orban the country has become a key player in the populist attack on the Western democratic order.
His state capture and attacks on the rule of law and minority rights have severely tested the EU’s democratic credentials.
Budapest’s geopolitical ambivalence has also generated suspicion that Russia and China see Hungary as a weak link regarding NATO security.
Orban has often wielded his veto in the twin Western institutions to support the interests of the Eastern giants, including obstructing Ukraine’s Western trajectory.
Orban’s role as an icon for the global far right adds to the vote’s importance.
A defeat for the Hungarian strongman, on the back of former President Donald Trump’s demise in the US and other recent setbacks for illiberals, would bolster suggestions that mainstream unity can fight populism.
Another four years for Orban could help reinvigorate the global drift towards authoritarianism.
“The outcome … will determine [Hungary’s] short-term stability and long-term political direction, toward either more autocratisation or re-democratisation,” said Daniel Hegedus, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
“The elections will also be of strategic importance for the European Union and Hungary’s transatlantic partners,” he said.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/h_57583778.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

‘Wild Wild West’
No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks but witnesses have attributed it to “bandits”, the catchall phrase for criminal gangs masterminding frequent bouts of abduction, maiming, sexual violence and killings of citizens across vast swaths of northern Nigeria.
They number in the tens of thousands but go around in dozens, sometimes more. They also often announce their presence by riding mostly motorcycles – and sometimes horses – into towns and villages they invade, with a seemingly endless supply of ammunition.
Many of the groups are believed to comprise mostly ethnic Fulanis, including pastoralists and mercenaries from the region as well as neighbouring Chad and the Niger Republic.
On several occasions, they have kidnapped schoolchildren in various parts of Nigeria’s Niger, Kebbi and Yobe states. Other victims of their kidnapping-for-ransom scheme range across all social classes, from politicians and members of their families to imams, clergymen, security guards and farmers.
In May 2019, the district head of Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari’s hometown, was kidnapped. He was freed after two months. Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said the incident was evidence that Duara was not receiving preferential treatment and that insecurity was a national problem.
According to the Wisconsin-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), one of the world’s most reliable conflict data aggregators, there were 18 abduction events targeting students across northern Nigeria between January 2018 and April 2021.
ACLED data also shows that the bandits killed more than 2,600 civilians in 2021, an increase of over 250% from 2020. This number dwarfs that of civilian deaths credited to Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province in the same year.
In the period between December 2020 and August 2021, more than 1,000 students and school staff were abducted. Within the next six months, as many as 343 people were killed, while 830 others were abducted by bandits between July and September 2021 in Kaduna state alone, according to figures from the state government.
Even though the axis of tragedy cuts across parts of the south, it is central and especially northwest Nigeria that continue to suffer the most. Residents of the latter region say the “bandits” operate as if they are above the law.
In some villages, they have even become the law, taxing locals on a regular basis.
‘Bandits’, ‘terrorists’ or a cocktail?
For nearly a century, small bands of cattle rustlers have been invading villages in the north for cows and food. That has often led them into direct conflict with farmers and other locals in these areas.
However, around 2011, things changed as a spate of armed attacks began in Zamfara state and rapidly intensified. Experts say the artisanal mining operations there had attracted gold thieves who then began marauding the villages at night.
Other criminal groups – and ethnicities – have since joined the fray, for various reasons.
“The bandits are [now] a motley mix of the displaced”, Ayisha Osori, director at Open Society Foundations and former chairperson of Open Society West Africa, told Al Jazeera.  “Those displaced by the over a decade-long violence in the northeast and those displaced by climate change – unable to farm, fish, trade.”
“[There are] also herders who – tired of their cattle being rustled and the fights with farmers – have found a more lucrative revenue-generating operation: kidnapping for ransom and trading terror for community payoffs,” she added. “The bandits also include the opportunistic – so criminally minded men, who may or may not be supported by some members of the Nigerian security force who, in a gradually collapsing economy, also find this a lucrative way of exploiting Nigerians.”
There is also the possibility that some are remnants of the Abubakar Shekau faction of Boko Haram in the northeast, who have been dislodged by the group’s other faction, now aligned to ISIL as ISWAP.
Some state governments halted monthly payments of salaries to vigilantes and ethnic militias – whom they had tasked with fighting the “bandits” – and struck disarmament deals to collect the weapons paid for with government funds. Disgruntled members of these groups are now also in the mix.
“After our ban of Yan Banga (vigilante) and allowances stopped, some transformed into Yan Sakai (volunteer forces) to revenge on Fulani people and some of them became criminals,” said Ibrahim Dosara, a spokesperson for the Zamfara government told Al Jazeera. “When we discovered that they were now part of the problem, the government banned them again.”
“We are dealing with well-funded and networked groups who are likely being supported by powerful people, including those invested in gold mining in Zamfara – which is the epicentre of the violence in the northwest,” Osori said.
But while the band has stretched to accommodate all kinds of criminal elements, the name has remained inelastic.

‘Ungoverned spaces’
The many forests in the northwest, especially the twin forests of Mashema in Zamfara’s north bordering the nearby Niger Republic and Birnin Gwari to the south leading to the neighbouring, equally insecure, state of Kaduna, have served as bases for the bandits to stockpile sophisticated weapons.
These, and some of the villages being routinely attacked, are now often referred to in analyst-speak as “ungoverned spaces”, “under-governed spaces” and the “Wild Wild West”.
On paper, Nigeria operates as a federation but Abuja still drip-feeds the 36 states. Additionally, corruption and incompetent leadership can be found at all tiers of government. This, among other things, has led to feelings of economic and political marginalisation, real or perceived, among various parts of the population. And many have been left to their own devices.
A couple of years ago, security forces announced a crackdown, including air raids and a telecoms shutdown in parts of the northwest in an attempt to flush the criminal gangs from their forest hideouts.
But Nigeria’s underfunded and under-equipped military is stretched thin because of soldier deployments elsewhere in the country, particularly to quell activities of Boko Haram in the northeast, separatist agitations in the southeast and a pastoralist crisis in central Nigeria.
The country’s land and sea borders, ever so porous, remain conduit pipes for the small and light weapons being trafficked into the country for operations by the armed groups.
In January, the government proscribed the bandits as terrorists.
In the official gazette, President Muhammadu Buhari’s government labelled the activities of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta’adda – references in the Hausa language to bandit gunmen – “as acts of terrorism and illegality”.
But that designation has barely changed anything.
Days after the announcement, an estimated 200 people were killed and 10,000 displaced in attacks by gunmen in Zamfara following military air raids on their hideouts the previous week.

The toys on the desk are “ice-breakers” for the children, the doctor tells me. A beaded bracelet, a small toy skull, chalky white dental moulds, a glass shaped like a lightbulb with a green candy-striped straw.
When her son and daughter were younger and would eat McDonalds’ Happy Meals, Dr Summaiya Syed would save the toys from them and bring them to work to add to the stash.
She would buy dolls and hand them to a child sitting across from her in the hospital room and play a game. The doll has been hurt. “Can you show me where it is hurting?” she would ask. “Did someone touch the doll?”
If the child showed her where it hurt, where the doll had felt an unwanted grasp, Dr Summaiya would ask, “Who did this to the doll?” There are no dolls here today. The children keep them when they leave the hospital.
Dr Summaiya has been a woman medico-legal officer (WMLO) for 23 years. The bespectacled 50-year-old doctor looks like a kindly but firm teacher. She has a warm smile and she patiently answers questions, but when a visitor asks her to tweak the rules just a little for some paperwork he needs, she adamantly refuses.
On the day we meet, her hair is pulled back in a bun and she is wearing a casual orange and black kameez with black jeans and sandals. Dupattas only get in the way, she says.
The door to her office does not remain closed for long, with staff popping in to run a decision by her or give updates on a case. Some of them call her ‘Sir’. She answers their queries and picks up the thread of our conversation without pause.

‘The bowels of society’
In 1999, Dr Summaiya, fresh out of medical school, was posted at the police surgeon’s office at Karachi’s Civil Hospital, where it was her job to examine female victims of violence including rapes, assaults and unnatural deaths, such as suicides, homicides or accidents.
At that time, she says, they didn’t even use the words “domestic violence”; it was just called “physical assault”.
“I had no idea what I was in for,” she recalls.
In medical school, while her peers were interested in lucrative specialisations, she told a friend she would like to be a coroner. And so it felt like a stroke of luck to her that she was a 27-year-old with a stable government job at a public hospital that paid 6,000 Pakistani rupees ($34) a month, tasked with determining the circumstances under which someone had lost their life or been injured.
Not everyone thought that. This is a job where you get your hands dirty.
“The MLO sits in the bowels of society,” Dr Summaiya explains. “I’ve seen bodies with heroin capsules in their abdomen, I’ve dealt with new-born children thrown on rubbish dumps, battered women, we go to graveyards for exhumations, you have to deal with the police and go to court to present your findings…” She trails off.
Most of the doctors who had been inducted with her, especially the women, requested transfers. In a city of roughly 10 million people at the time, there were only four WMLOs and, as far as she can remember, 20 male MLOs.
In the first month of her new job, Dr Summaiya dealt with the case of a girl who had been raped by her sports teacher. She was summoned to court – her first time there – to present her evidence.
Even after all this time, she still remembers the judge’s name and the court room number. “Jaffrey sahib in court room number one.”
When she was grilled in cross-examination about why the girl’s hymen seemed to have escaped injury, she quoted from the MLO’s “holy book”, Parikh’s Simplified Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology to explain why she could not conclusively say that it had, as she was unable to see the hymen clearly to check for injuries. “I knew that with children under the age of 10, the hymen cannot be easily visualised, and I knew exactly which page it said so in the textbook,” she says.
The judge turned to her and said, “You’re in the right field.” The perpetrator was sentenced to 14 years. It was Dr Summaiya’s first conviction. She hasn’t looked back since. “I thrive on this work,” she says.

Each case is a puzzle
An MLO is responsible for conducting a complete physical examination of a victim, collecting evidence for testing, providing treatment (such as emergency contraception in the case of rape), referring the case to the police and testifying in court if necessary. An MLO can deal with victims of incidents such as bombings, firearm injuries, physical assault, homicide, suicide, rape and sexual assault. The MLO writes a report based on their examination and records statements from living victims. Both are submitted to the police.
“I tried my hand at paediatrics, but I was too emotional with my patients to be of any use to them,” says Dr Summaiya. Even now, she is greatly troubled when she has to examine the bodies of children or pregnant women who have suffered violence.
“I can imagine the agony they were in in their last moments,” she says. “It’s a curse. I had to learn to compartmentalise and not lose my objectivity.”
Dr Summaiya is motivated by the prospect of an investigation. “I cannot sit still until a case is solved.”
Each case, she says, is like a puzzle, one that requires not just a close study of the textbooks, but good instincts. In one case, for instance, a girl was brought in by her father as he said she had been raped by their neighbour. “I felt suspicious about why the mother was not with the child at this traumatic time,” Dr Summaiya explains. She asked for the father’s blood sample.
The cells from the girl’s vaginal swabs matched with the father’s blood sample. He had lied about the neighbour to cover up for sexually assaulting his child. “These puzzles don’t bring me down, they wake me up,” she says.
When I ask where she developed a taste for mystery, she laughs. “Who knows! Agatha Christie books? A hefty dose of Famous Five? Maybe Nancy Drew or jasoosi (spy) novels.”

‘Not a regular mom’
There is no satisfaction, however, in some cases. In May 2020, when a plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Karachi, killing 97 passengers, Dr Summaiya did 34 autopsies in one day.
And in this city, where everyone has a story about a mugging gone awry or can tell you exactly where they were when a riot broke out, it didn’t take long for a familiar face to arrive on a gurney in her examination room. In one case, the body of a 16-year-old girl who had been stabbed by a home intruder was brought in. She was a friend’s daughter. “I lost count of the wounds,” Dr Summaiya recalls quietly.
Three years into her first job, Dr Summaiya’s son was born. When he was not even a year old, she would bring him in to work with her when she was on night duty. “You’re on call 12 hours a day, with no days off for Eid, no sick leave, no days off for a death in the family,” she says.
Her son was learning to walk, still wobbly on his legs, as she would sit at her desk and write her notes from examinations. The violence she witnessed indelibly seeped into her experience as a mother. By the time her daughter was born in 2004, she says, “I was a traumatised mom, not a regular mom.”
While her children, now 18 and 20, joke that they’re ‘prisoners’ because of her rules (curfews, no riding motorbikes, all friends must be introduced to her), she explains, “Here’s what I knew even before they were born: at even six months, a child can be raped. At 10, they can be kidnapped.”
When her son went to a concert on Valentine’s Day this year, she called him close to his 10pm curfew. He didn’t answer the phone. The concert was in a basement venue and he had no cell reception there. “For an hour, I was going crazy with worry,” she says. “I stopped short of calling the police in that neighbourhood’s jurisdiction to raid the venue.”
In November 2020, Dr Summaiya became the Additional Police Surgeon, Karachi at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. She is the first woman to hold this post [Sanam Maher/Al Jazeera]
Changing the system
In November 2020, she started a new role, becoming the first woman to hold the post of Additional Police Surgeon, Karachi, at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), one of the city’s busiest public hospitals. “I was posted here by some people who thought I could bring about a change in the system,” she explains. “My colleagues and I wanted to make this hospital the face of medico-legal standards in the country.”
Among the reforms on her agenda: the need for greater discussion on ‘object rape’, introducing standard operating procedures for the collection of samples for evidence, and no MLO working under her would be allowed to use the ‘two-finger test’ on rape victims.
Dr Summaiya describes the latter, whereby a doctor inserts two fingers into the vagina to detect if the hymen is present and how “habituated” a woman is to intercourse, as “akin to raping a survivor again”. Many MLOs, she says, persist in using the test rather than note bruising or injuries or speaking with the survivor to determine what has happened as they feel it is “quicker and easier”, and often don’t bother to take vaginal swabs or other samples once they’ve conducted the test.
In 2021, the Lahore High Court banned the test in Punjab province, saying it was “illegal and against the Constitution of Pakistan”; Dr Summaiya and a senior doctor, Dr Farhat Hussain Mirza, were tasked by the health department with supporting a petition calling for the test’s abolition in Sindh province, and the court ruled in their favour in September 2021.
“We have been working in the dark ages for so long, and that is why our judicial system is the way that it is,” Dr Summaiya says. She draws a triangle for me on a piece of paper. She writes at each point: MLO, prosecution, investigating officer. In the centre of the triangle, “judge”.
Each point needs to work together on a case for a successful conviction, she explains. In the case of sexual assault, a cursory look at the numbers tells you that this is not happening: more than 14,000 women have reportedly been raped in Pakistan in the last four years, and fewer than three percent of rapists in those cases were convicted.

Evidence for a watertight case
In her corner of the triangle, one of the changes that Dr Summaiya has been working on since 2016 is an overhaul of the way that evidence of sexual assault is documented.
She hands me a form with a few sections to be filled in. When she first started working, this is the kind of form she would be required to use to gather evidence. With experience, an MLO would learn that this form contains a fraction of the information needed for a watertight case. “A doctor would fill this form based on their expertise,” she explains. “A great deal was left to chance as a doctor with a day’s experience will record evidence very differently to a doctor who has 20 years of experience.”
That piece of paper is a crucial record. In 2002, in one of the most well-known cases of rape in Pakistan, 14 men in the village of Meerwala in Muzaffargarh district, Punjab, were accused of raping a woman named Mukhtara Mai as revenge for her 13-year-old brother’s alleged relationship with a woman from another tribe. She was then paraded naked through the village. Only six of the 14 men were convicted and sentenced to death. They appealed and five were acquitted. In 2005, the Supreme Court upheld this judgement by the Lahore High Court, citing a lack of evidence.
Dr Summaiya does not want anything to slip through the cracks. She places a second form on the table. It is far more detailed, with three sections documenting a physical examination, the doctor’s notes and opinion. “Look at this one,” she instructs. “Even if it was your first day on the job, the form guides you. With this, we do not have to rely on a doctor’s experience to check for certain things.”
For instance: Has the victim bathed, therefore getting rid of potential evidence? Does the victim have children and if so, what was the mode of delivery? “A woman who has had four children will present differently compared with a 14-year-old,” Dr Summaiya explains. “If she has fewer injuries, that does not mean she wasn’t subjected to rape.”
The new form asks the doctors to mention the victim’s gait. If a woman has been gang-raped, her gait is affected. A doctor must note down the dates of the incident, the victim’s recovery and the date and time they were examined. With the passing of each day, an MLO’s findings will change as evidence – traces of semen, blood, or marks of violence – can be lost.
“With all the additional information, I’m giving the police and prosecution evidence to build a case, to corroborate what the victim tells them,” Dr Summaiya says. The new form has two times the space to note down “marks of violence”, so a doctor can be as thorough as possible.

Resistance in her stride
A kitten mewls from under her chair. Dr Summaiya has forgotten to feed the litter of strays outside her office. “Come on, baby,” she says, getting up. Another kitten darts out from a corner. “The cats we take care of do have names but this is a new bunch, so for now their names are billi (cat) number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.”
When she returns, one of her clerks brings in a plate and she beams. Masala-covered French fries. He thought she might be getting hungry. She continues to explain the details on the new forms to me while nibbling on the fries. But then another member of her staff walks in and scolds her. “Your blood pressure is going to be high if you eat those.”
She ignores him and continues. “When I first started working, we did not have to record the victim’s consent to be examined,” she says. “If you forcefully examined someone who has been raped, what is the difference between you and the rapist?”
The forms were submitted for approval to the prosecutor general and they have been in use at JPMC for a year. Dr Summaiya describes them as an evolving document and she hopes that they will eventually be used across Sindh. She asks her MLOs – four women and three men – for feedback and plans to tweak them further, with the addition of sections such as pictograms to thoroughly document marks of violence on the body.
But the change has not come easily.
To the left of her desk is a small whiteboard mounted on the wall with the following instructions: “Stop expecting honesty from people who lie to themselves. Save your explanations for those who understand you. Give your silence to those who are determined to misunderstand you.”
Dr Summaiya has glanced at this whiteboard often in the past year. She keeps a yellow and green rubber snake on her desk, to remind her of her enemies, she says, only half-joking.
There has been resistance to the new forms. While some MLOs said it was not their job to gather extra data and it took too much extra time, others knew that it hampered their chances of fudging data, misreporting it or leaving out information in exchange for a bribe from the perpetrators.
The form reveals poor treatment: for instance, an MLO is now required to note the time a victim was brought in and the time they were examined. “If there is a gap of several hours, the MLO gets caught, you see, and they’re not happy about it,” Dr Summaiya says. The amounts slipped under the table can significantly supplement a meagre government salary. In one case, Dr Summaiya says she was offered – and refused – 2.5 million Pakistani rupees ($14,000) to record a homicide as an accident.
She has learned to take the resistance in her stride. The hurdles are not new.

‘Stepchildren of the medical system’
The office allotted to her is located in the hospital’s old surgical wing. Faded signs for the thyroid clinic and exam rooms remain on the doors. Files are laden on stretchers and three clerks have devised a system to keep them organised. Outside the office doors, men ride their motorbikes through the corridor and paan stains walls plastered with notices to respect the hospital space and keep it clean. The office we sit in has no air conditioner, no large windows for ventilation. It would be brutal in the summer heatwaves.
Dr Summaiya has been in this room for six months, as her last office, just across the corridor, became unusable when part of the ceiling crumbled and caved in. It is now filled with sacks of old files destroyed by water damage or termites. Some of those bags may contain reports needed in court, as cases can take six months to four years to go to trial. The last time Dr Summaiya was in court this year, it was for a case she documented in 2016.
Every day, people arrive here on one of the worst days of their life and they are at the mercy of a system that seems designed to fail. There is no budget for the forms that document the violence they have endured – every month, the MLOs contribute Rs1,000 ($5.60) each to pay for the printing of forms, and Dr Summaiya makes up the deficit.
This year, the Legal Aid Society, a not-for-profit organisation offering assistance and representation, offered the funds. The victims will be examined in a room with blinds that Dr Summaiya paid for to ensure their privacy, with bilingual posters she had printed to inform them of their rights. A victim relies on the MLO to collect as much evidence as possible, but what they may not know is that the MLO may be required to buy swabs, jars, or sterile casings for samples out of their own pocket if supplies fall short. “If you don’t take on the cost, you’re weakening the case,” Dr Summaiya explains. “In court, it’s not good enough to say that you didn’t do your job properly because you didn’t have what you needed.”
Ambulance drivers share clean sheets from their supplies to cover bodies, E.R. staff provide sanitiser, PPE or gloves. Once samples are collected, a police officer will transport them to the lab, often travelling on a motorbike. In one instance, an officer carrying glass vials of samples in plastic bags got into an accident. All evidence was destroyed. “We are the stepchildren of the medical system,” Dr Summaiya says with a smile. “No one is willing to accept us or provide for us.”
There is little interest, she says, in how crucial their work is. Most doctors dismiss the MLOs as a corrupt bunch. “Our reputation precedes us, and the few who aren’t dishonest are tarred with the same brush,” Dr Summaiya explains. “After all, you don’t eat the entire deg (pot) to judge the biryani, do you? You base your opinion on one bite.”
When I ask her if she ever thinks of quitting, she laughs. “Every day! Every day I tell my husband, ‘That’s it, I’m done, I’m not going in tomorrow.’ And he reminds me, ‘That’s what you said yesterday.’”
She pulls the rubber snake on her desk closer and strokes its webbed pattern. “This is a fight that continues, and if I quit, I’ve lost. I’m not a quitter.”
