Zelenskyy, who has been addressing parliaments around the world via video link urging countries to send more money and arms, called diplomacy “one of the key fronts” in the battle to win the war against Russia. He also said he was expecting results from Ukraine’s military attaches in embassies abroad.
His comments came as a delegation of politicians from Ukraine’s parliament visited Washington to push the United States for increased assistance, saying their country needs more military equipment, more financial help and tougher sanctions against Russia.
The administration of US President Joe Biden has led the Western response to the February 24 invasion, levelling unprecedented sanctions against Russia and funnelling weapons and aid to Ukraine.
Now in its fifth week, the war has so far killed thousands of people and wounded even more, with some four million forced to flee abroad.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP22074068472191.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The man was identified as Nidal Jumaa Jaafra, 30, from the village of Tarqoumya near Hebron in the southern occupied West Bank.
In Jenin, 15 other Palestinians were wounded by live ammunition during the army raid, local media reports said, with at least three in a critical condition.
The Palestinian health ministry said the army fired tear gas near the Jenin public hospital, which seeped into the emergency department and disrupted its operations.
The army also raided and ransacked the home of Palestinian man Diaa Hamarsheh, 27, who carried out a shooting attack on Tuesday in the ultra-orthodox town of Bnei Brak east of Tel Aviv, killing five Israelis including a policeman.
Hamarsheh, who was shot dead in an armed confrontation with police, was a labourer who worked in Bnei Brak but lived in the village of Ya’bad outside Jenin city.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Hamarsheh’s house “has been set up for demolition” in order to “create deterrence”.

Some 11 Israelis, including three police officers, were killed in three separate attacks inside Israel by Palestinians in a surge of violence not witnessed in years.
On Sunday, two Palestinian gunmen from the northern town of Umm al-Fahm opened fire in the city of Hadera (Khdeira), killing two border police officers.
It followed an attack on March 22 when a Palestinian from the village of Hura in the Naqab (Negev) carried out a stabbing and car-ramming, killing four Israelis.
All the Palestinian assailants were shot dead at the scene, either by police or armed Israeli civilians.
On Wednesday, Bennett told Israelis “this is the time to carry a weapon”.
Israel has deployed thousands of reinforcements in the occupied West Bank, inside Israel, and along the besieged Gaza Strip.
In recent days, Israeli settlers across the occupied West Bank have held rallies on main roads and attacked Palestinian vehicles near Salfit and Nablus.
Armed Jewish vigilante groups have also been operating and assaulting Palestinians, hospitalising several, in the southern region of Naqab, and in the central town of al-Lydd. Also in al-Lydd, videos emerged of Israeli gangs smashing Palestinian cars.
Tensions on the ground have remained high since April and May last year.
Israeli attempts to forcibly displace residents of the Palestinian neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, and subsequent violent raids at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem during Ramadan in 2021 led to mass Palestinian protests and an 11-day confrontation between Israel and Palestinian armed movements in the besieged Gaza Strip.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Palestine.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

“The FAF is determined to use all legally permitted means to have its rights restored and to replay the match under conditions guaranteeing the honesty and partiality of the arbitration,” it said, adding that it has also requested the “opening of an investigation” into the matter.

 
Cameroon secured their place on away goals with the last kick of the match against Algeria, deep into extra time, as Karl Toko Ekambi swept home a speculative cross to win the match 2-1.
Algeria, who had won the first leg in Cameroon 1-0, were left crestfallen by the defeat.
“We were only 10 seconds away from the World Cup. We collapsed,” Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi said after the loss.
“We put our lives on hold for this match and this success and we only had qualification on our minds. It is going to be hard to get through the next days.”
Egypt claims ‘racist’ fan behaviour
Meanwhile, the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) launched a complaint with FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) against its Senegalese counterpart for violent and “racist” fan behaviour, according to a statement released on Wednesday, after Senegal defeated Egypt in a penalty shoot-out to qualify for Qatar 2022.

According to the EFA’s statement, “The Egyptian team was subjected to racism as crowds held up offensive banners in the stands, particularly against team captain Mohamed Salah.”
The complaint also said players were pelted with water bottles and stones during their warm-up.
There was widespread criticism online about the crowd shining green lasers in the faces of the players during the game. Those lasers were notably seen on Salah before his penalty miss.
Usher Komugisha, an African football journalist, said both Algeria and Egypt’s appeals are unlikely to succeed.
“When you look at the history of how FIFA has handled cases like this, they’ll have to prove that there was malpractice or that there was corruption with the referee,” Komugisha told Al Jazeera.
“Also you have to give credit to Bakary Papa Gassama [who officiated Algeria v Cameroon], he’s one of the top three best referees on the African continent – he knows what he’s doing,” she said.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP22089239333294.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The announcement on Wednesday followed a decision by the Tunisian parliament to reconvene virtually in defiance of Saied, who had suspended parliament last July, and a vote to end the president’s emergency rule.
Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Tunisia’s president dissolves parliament, extending power grablist 2 of 3Are Tunisians ready for a constitutional referendum?list 3 of 3Tunisia: Mass anti-Saied protests take place in capital Tunisend of listSaied had done his best to stop that vote from taking place, blocking online video platforms Zoom and Microsoft Teams throughout Tunisia for a part of the day in a bid to prevent the MPs from voting on the motion.
The president then delivered an angry late-night address hours after the vote had taken place, accusing parliament of attempting to “stage a coup with foreign intervention”.
Saied went on to declare that he would not hold elections within three months following the current constitution. Instead, he would proceed with drafting a new constitution, which will be put to a referendum on July 25, and then hold elections in December, in which “conspirators will be forbidden from running”, a reference to opposition politicians.

Saied’s escalation reflected the significance of Wednesday’s parliamentary vote, which was the most serious challenge to Kais Saied since he sacked the government, suspended parliament and took emergency powers eight months ago.
At the time, Saied, who was elected in 2019, said that his measures were necessary to fight corruption. Although he received support from many Tunisians at the time, opposition has grown as he has seized more power.
The standoff between the president and parliament has left Tunisia in uncertain legal territory, with both sides claiming authority, and Saied in control of the country’s top judicial body.
“The parliamentary vote is historic because it removes the legal legitimacy from [Saied’s July 2021] coup, and delivers a clear message to the Tunisian people and Tunisia’s international partners that the parliament is intent on fulfilling its role in protecting the democratic gains of the 2011 revolution,” an anti-Saied Tunisian member of parliament, Issam Bargougi, told Al Jazeera, referencing the Arab Spring revolution that overthrew former President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali.
“The parliament is defending the state institutions, and asserting that it is the primary legislative body and has authority over the president, who has revolted against the Constitution,” Bargougi, who has been sentenced by a military court in absentia for opposing Saied’s power grab, added.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Saied under pressure
Wednesday’s vote came amid testing times for Saied, with the problems that plague the Tunisian economy showing few signs of abating.
Last week, Fitch Ratings, the American credit rating agency, downgraded Tunisia’s sovereign debt to CCC, a sign that the country’s economic outlook is poor.
Prices of basic goods have soared and bakeries across the country have announced closures.
Tunisia’s powerful UGTT trade union, which had backed Saied’s moves last July, has openly attacked the president and threatened strikes in protest against IMF-backed economic reforms, while its leader, Noureddine Tabboubi, has demanded clarity about Saied’s political plan.
Saied has also found himself under international pressure as former backers, such as the United States and the European Union, worry that he is moving Tunisia away from democracy.
“It is very possible that the international community, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other international donors will seek to create greater distance between themselves and Kais Saied,” Khalid Hermasi, a Tunisian political commentator, told Al Jazeera.

Military and trade unions
Saied seemed likely to clamp down on opposition in the future; prominent supporters welcomed Saied’s actions and have called for him to suppress dissent.
“Ghannouchi’s parliament has been dissolved … the Muslim Brotherhood parliament has been dissolved, the parliament that attacks women has been dissolved,” said Abir Moussi, the head of the pro-Ben Ali Free Destourian Party, referring to Rachid Ghannouchi, the leader of the biggest party in parliament, Ennahdha, which had ties with the Muslim Brotherhood.
“The full force of the law will be brought to bear [on members of parliament who voted against Saied],” said Riyadh Jrad, a Tunisian media personality, in an appearance on local television.
Saied’s justice minister also launched an investigation into charges of “conspiracy against the state” against a number of members of parliament who voted in the parliamentary session. Ghannouchi, the parliament’s speaker, said that 20 members of parliament, including members of his party, had been summoned by Tunisia’s anti-terrorism unit for investigation.
Yet, the relevance of the vote may not be Saied’s to decide. Instead, Tunisia’s trade unions and army may intervene.
“We will seek to work with all the democratic forces in the country in order to force Kais Saied to recognise the decision made today,” said Bargougi. “The decision in parliament today will be delivered clearly to the leaders of the Tunisian army and the trade unions, and these powers will cease to lend their support to Kais Saied from now on.”
“[The vote] ensnared Kais Saied and put him in a difficult position, particularly with regards to his relationship with the military and security institutions,” said Hermasi. “The ball is in the court of the security forces, given that Article 18 of the Constitution permits the army to intervene in situations in which there is a clear threat to the state.”
While the army has the power to reopen the parliament building and restore access to its members, thereby ending Saied’s emergency rule, it is still unclear what its position will be.
The UGTT trade union leadership, despite its criticism of Saied, has still been broadly supportive of the president, which could carry him through despite the growing opposition.
“The decision to dissolve parliament came late, but it was necessary,” said Sami al-Tahiri, the UGTT secretary-general. “Parliament was already suspended and effectively dead. We honour the dead by burying them.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-02-08T111233Z_1347538244_RC2NFS94L6P7_RTRMADP_3_TUNISIA-POLITICS-G7.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Land Day demonstrations in Hamas-run Gaza are usually large, with many residents of the besieged territory originally coming from towns and villages that are now in southern Israel.
Although they are only a short distance away, the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza have never been able to travel to them.
This year’s event comes at a tense time, with three attacks carried out in just over a week by Palestinians that have killed 11 Israelis.
Maher Mezher, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine attending the event, said that Land Day was part of a wider phenomenon of Palestinians, both inside Israel and in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, reaffirming their national identity.
“The latest wave against Israel in 1948 territories [Israel] reflects the accumulated anger among the Palestinians there, due to Israel’s continued violations against them, and the demolition and confiscation of lands and homes,” Mezher said.

“The land is our land and we will stick to it until the last drop of blood in us,” Abdel-Al said.
Abdel-Al also made reference to Diaa Hamarsha, a Palestinian gunman who killed five Israelis in an attack on Tuesday in the Israeli town of Bnei Brak, before being shot dead by Israeli police.
“Greetings to all our people in the West Bank, in the 1948 territories, and in the Naqab [Negev], and a salute for the soul of the martyr Diaa Hamarsha,” she said.
For his part, Muhammad Baraka, a member of the Palestinian National Committee, said in a speech to the crowds that Palestinians continued to suffer under the occupation.
“The Gaza Strip groans under siege, the West Bank is divided by settlements, and Jerusalem witnesses daily Israeli attempts to assassinate its Arab, Islamic and Christian identity,” Baraka said.
Baraka also called upon Palestinian politicians to end the divisions between them, calling it the “darkest chapter in Palestinian history.”

Waving the Palestinian flag, Abu Muhammad Salah, 65 years old, said that he commemorates Land Day every year.
“Every year, my belief increases that our return to our homes is close, and that the end of the Israel occupation is near,” Salah said.
Although this year’s event passed by without any violence, Land Day in Gaza in past years has erupted in clashes at the border fence with Israel
In 2018, Palestinians in Gaza used the day to begin a series of mass protests dubbed the Great March of Return, which lasted two years.
The protests saw major bloodshed with more than 260 Palestinians killed, mostly by Israeli sniper fire.
Nearly 7,000 others were shot and wounded, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Ni’ma Abu Alomarin was one of those injured. The 22-year-old said that she was supposed to travel to a hospital in Jerusalem for treatment, but was banned from entering.
Despite that, Abu Alomarin attended this year’s event.
“On this day I feel the land is ours,” she said. “Even with my injury, I will not stop, and I will remain faithful to the defence of our cause.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Land.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

In a statement released on Wednesday, Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB) also urged Manama to remove restrictions on freedom of expression and refrain from imposing political conditions on who can run in the November elections.

“Unless conditions improve quickly, the 2022 elections will again be a sham perpetrated by the Government of Bahrain on the Bahraini people and any facade of democracy in Bahrain will end.”

The call came two weeks after US President Joe Biden signed into law a funding bill that was accompanied by a statement (PDF) calling on the Department of State to produce a report detailing US “efforts made on behalf of political prisoners in Bahrain and the Government of Bahrain’s response”.
“The congressionally-mandated report is part of a larger effort to encourage the US State Department and other leading democracies to live up to the promises and rhetoric of the Biden Administration’s Summit for Democracy and to put pressure on anti-democratic regimes like the Government of Bahrain,” said Abdulla.
“If the 2022 elections are as unfair as the 2018 elections, the US must begin to pivot away from Bahrain and seek out partners in the Middle East who share US values.”
Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy in which the king acts as head of state and parliament enjoys limited legislative powers. Elections are held every four years to determine the 40-member Council of Representatives – the lower chamber of parliament. Forty members of the Shura Council, the other legislative body, are appointed by royal decree.
Activists and members of banned opposition parties had boycotted the 2018 election, dismissing it as a “farce”. Amnesty International warned before the last election in Bahrain that “political opposition has been effectively suppressed over the course of the past two years, with a disproportionate impact on Shia political, civic and religious leaders”.
In its most recent report on human rights globally, the Department of State last year documented “significant” rights issues in Bahrain, including torture, arbitrary detention, political prisoners, restrictions on freedom of expression, and substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

Still, despite its promise to centre human rights in US foreign policy, the Biden administration has not pressured Bahrain – at least publicly – to improve its human rights record.
US officials have heaped praise on the Bahraini government and other Arab countries that normalised relations with Israel.
During a visit to Israel in the past week, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken jointly met Israeli officials and top diplomats from countries that had normalised relations with Israel.
“We are fully committed to expanding cooperation through the Abraham Accords, and building on the remarkable progress that Israel, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco have made in such a short period of time,” Blinken said on Sunday.","/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6b59cd2c524c4d6397847532e6015144_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513"

New rules proposed by the EU’s executive arm call for a mandatory minimum use of recycled fibres by 2030 and would ban the destruction of many unsold products. The European Commission rules also would seek to contain the release of microplastics and improve global labour conditions in the garment industry.

The changes would require a massive shift in an industry that in order to keep costs and prices down, produces items with a short life span in developing nations in Asia and Latin America, often under poor working conditions.
“All textiles should be long lasting, recyclable, made of recycled fibres and free of dangerous substances. The strategy also aims to boost reuse and repair sectors and address textile waste,” Timmermans said.
Almost three-quarters of all clothing and textiles used in EU are imported. In 2019, the 27-nation bloc imported over 80 billion euros ($89.2bn) in clothes, mainly from China, Bangladesh and Turkey, according to the European Commission, and the average consumer throws away 11 kilos (more than 24 pounds) of textiles a year.
Fast fashion is most closely associated in Europe with the high street – commercial areas where clothes-hunters shop at mass-market retailers such as H&M, Primark and Zara. The EU, although targeting clothing made for that market, also wants luxury brands to set the standard for sustainable fashion in an industry where the fleeting and ephemeral are essential to turnover.
“There’s a cultural change taking place,” Timmermans said, adding that major fashion houses “are always the first to show the way forward”.
“The designers, the artists – they realise that the world has changed and that we need to revisit the way we design fashion,” he said.
Sustainability is a new frontier in the luxury industry. Upcycling and other methods to reduce the carbon footprint have been mainstays for some of the most famous brands on the runways of London and Paris, such as Stella McCartney, which belongs to the Kering group, and more recently Chloe under sustainability-conscious designer Gabriela Hearst.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fastfashion.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

In a statement on Wednesday, the US Treasury Department said the sanctions target an Iran-based procurement agent, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, and his network of companies that it accused of procuring “ballistic missile propellant-related materials”.

“This action reinforces the United States’ commitment to preventing the Iranian regime’s development and use of advanced ballistic missiles,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E Nelson.
Iran’s foreign ministry slammed the latest sanctions on Thursday, calling them “another sign of the US government’s malice towards the Iranian people”.
Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said the sanctions show the US “continues the failed policy of maximum pressure against Iran”, a reference to former US President Donald Trump’s sanctions regime, which Washington imposed on Tehran after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal.
The latest back and forth comes as the US and Iran are in negotiations to return to the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which saw Tehran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.

After Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement, Tehran began escalating its nuclear programme beyond the limits set by the pact.
The Biden administration has said it is privileging the path of diplomacy with the Iranian government and wants to get all the parties back into mutual compliance with the JCPOA.
“While the United States continues to seek Iran’s return to full compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we will not hesitate to target those who support Iran’s ballistic missile program,” Nelson said.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

The companies hit with sanctions in Wednesday’s action include Iran-based Jestar Sanat Delijan and Sina Composite Delijan Co, as well as P.B. Sadr Co.
The curbs freeze any US assets of those targeted and generally bar Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with them also risk being hit with sanctions, the Treasury said.
The department also said the curbs come after recent attacks in the Middle East claimed by Iranian and Iran-linked groups, including IRGC ballistic missile attacks in Erbil in northern Iraq in mid-March, and rocket and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia carried out by Yemen’s Houthi rebels last week.
“We have taken this action following Iran’s recent missile attack on Erbil, Iraq, as well as missile attacks by Iranian proxies against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a separate statement.

Meanwhile, indirect negotiations between the US and Iran, which have been under way in Vienna for nearly a year, have overcome repeated disagreements but outstanding issues remain.
Among them is an Iranian demand that the IRGC be removed from a US “terror” blacklist, which Washington has resisted.
Speaking at the Doha Form last weekend, the US special envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, said the nuclear deal is not intended to address Iran’s regional policies or the behaviour of the IRGC.
But he declined to address the specifics of the negotiations or whether the US is considering de-listing the Iranian force.
“Many in the region view the IRGC in the same way that we view it and just witnessed the latest attack in Erbil. But we know this is not a deal that’s going to address that,” Malley said.
“So put aside, regardless of the outcome on the question of [de-listing] the IRGC, which I won’t address, I can tell you that the IRGC will remain sanctioned under US law. And our perception, our views, our policy towards the IRGC will not have changed.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2021-05-24T101450Z_1496577794_RC2AMN9VDRTB_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-IAEA.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Each morning, I passed an elegantly crumbling building that, without fail, threw me through a psycho-geographical loop as I became momentarily convinced that I was in fact in Beirut – one of my regular pre-pandemic stomping grounds and a metropolis that boasted its own iconic seaside promenade and fair share of holes in the pavement.
This particular building evoked the Lebanese capital for various reasons, not only its colonial-style architecture and Ottoman-esque windows but also the fact that one of its sections was fully collapsed – a common architectural repercussion in the formerly relentlessly celebrated “Paris of the Middle East”. Following its so-called “golden age” in the mid-20th century, Beirut had gone on to host, inter alia, a 15-year civil war (1975-90), brutal Israeli military assaults backed by the United States, vast post-war demolitions in the interest of historical amnesia and ever-savage elite enrichment, and the Beirut port explosion of August 2020. In that final landmark event, a significant portion of the city and numerous inhabitants were blown up thanks to wilful state negligence – a form of war in its own right.
In Havana, itself incidentally once dubbed the “Paris of the Caribbean”, contemporary warfare has primarily consisted of the longstanding de facto US war on Cuba. This began in the wake of the 1959 triumph of the Cuban Revolution, which spelled the tragic end to imperial plunder of the island under the charitable supervision of US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista – who, as US author TJ English puts it in Havana Nocturne – relied on “torture squads” as well as “government-sanctioned terrorism”.
An October 2020 Reuters article specified that, in the aftermath of the Revolution, the Cuban state “confiscated many of Cuba’s grand historic buildings and distributed them to poor and middle-class families” – especially in Havana, where the “eclectic mix of colonial, neoclassical, baroque and Art Deco buildings are considered among the architectural jewels of Latin America”.
While the article credits “communist rule” with having long saved these edifices from the “urban developer’s bulldozer”, structural disrepair has been inevitable thanks to a confluence of factors that include the Cuban climate and an ever-intensifying US embargo – which just celebrated its 60th anniversary of creating widespread shortages of everything from milk to construction materials. Despite the charm that is seemingly undeniably exuded by certain types of dilapidation – as documented by many a camera-wielding visitor to the one-time Parises of both the Caribbean and the Middle East – it can also be lethal. Reuters cites the demise of three girls who were crushed to death in January 2020 by a falling Havana balcony.
As my own stay in Havana progressed, I was struck by the increased frequency with which my movements through the city triggered flashbacks to Beirut – and not just on account of sheer physical resemblance, as was the case with the crumbling building on the Malecón. Rather, it appeared that both cityscapes intermittently elicited the same sort of romanticisation of decay and nostalgia for bygone eras – but eras that were, critically, marked by colonialism, imperialism, and huge injustice, which left me wondering whether my susceptibility to such nostalgic whims was itself a fundamentally morally compromised affair.
Human history, in general, has, of course, been one fairly continuous injustice – and injustice can, unfortunately, be intoxicating. For many people, the enduring magnetism of both Havana and Beirut has something to do with their historically recent service as venues of international glitz and glamour – places where socioeconomic inequity and other mundane issues mattered only insofar as they underscored the superior value of the earth’s ruling classes.
In Havana’s heyday, hedonism went down at the city’s nightclubs, casinos, hotels, and brothels – many of them affiliated with what TJ English terms “the Havana Mob”, the assorted US mafiosi who decided to make a killing in Cuba while the killing was good under US buddy Batista, the wannabe godfather of a Cuban “capitalist Shangri-La”. Nowadays, English notes and ubiquitous vintage American cars from the 1940s and 1950s complement the “flickering neon signs and air of insouciance that contribute to the city’s allure” – amounting to a “hallucinatory” effect in which, “on certain nights, it is as if the ghosts of the past are still alive, a spooky, spectral testament to the era of the Havana Mob”.
But spookiness is sometimes sexy, and in Beirut, too, the ghosts of the past are alive as ever – and not just in the current Lebanese political class. They can also be found in the city’s war-scarred façades and the lingering essence of that legendary pre-war Lebanese “joie de vivre”, an Orientalist cliché that more or less means flashy Western-style overconsumption in opulent establishments and was obviously only ever an option for those with the proper socioeconomic credentials. In the 1960s, the New York Times notes, Beirut was “a fashionable port of call” and Brigitte Bardot “was a regular”. And what do you know: as with the Cuban Revolution, the Lebanese civil war was itself triggered in no small part by colossal inequality.
Given the surplus of Orientalist musings inspired by Lebanon’s capital city over the years, it is no doubt fitting that Edward Said chose to commence his seminal book Orientalism with a tale about a French journalist who, reporting from Beirut at the start of the civil war, “wrote regretfully of the gutted downtown area that ‘it had once seemed to belong to… the Orient of Chateaubriand and Nerval’”. Fast forward almost half a century, and perhaps we have simply tacked another layer of preconceived nostalgia and mystique onto our conception of what Beirut once was.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

In her text Regarding the Pain of Others, Susan Sontag observes: “To find beauty in war photographs seems heartless. But the landscape of devastation is still a landscape. There is beauty in ruins.” And as the planet now hurtles towards self-inflicted capitalist destruction, it seems Havana and Beirut are two very fine landscapes indeed in which to contemplate the aesthetics of ruin.

Qatar’s human rights record
Questions and concerns over Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers took centre stage at the conference.
Norwegian Football Federation President Lise Klaveness took to the stage during the Congress and termed the awarding of the tournament to Qatar in 2010 “unacceptable”.
Meanwhile, FIFA President Gianni Infantino pointed to “the changes that have happened in this country” as a positive sign towards Qatar being awarded the World Cup.
Hassan al-Thawadi, chief of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, said labour reforms achieved by Qatar have been “historical” and the event would leave “truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies”.

Biennial World Cup plans
The FIFA president also seemingly stepped back from plans of hosting a World Cup every two years.
Infantino’s ambition to make the World Cup a biennial tournament has been under fire, but at the Congress he told member nations that FIFA had not been proposing the move but rather aiming to look into its feasibility.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

“FIFA has not proposed a biennial World Cup,” he said. “The majority voted in the last Congress to start feasibility for this. After feasibility, the next phase starts where we find agreements and reach a compromise.
“We try to have debate and discuss to see what is suitable for everyone. Everyone has to benefit.”

Russia’s presence at the Congress
While Russia’s national team was thrown out of the World Cup qualifiers and its club sides banned from competitions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the country’s football federation was allowed to be part of the Congress on Thursday.
Answering a question on why the federation was not barred and suspended from FIFA, Infantino said: “Russia has a football union. Like any other federation, [it] has not been suspended, as such, by FIFA. It has been participating in this congress as well, because if we don’t have occasions to bring people together like a congress, then we’d rather stop and go home.”
Alexey Sorokin, adviser to the Russian football chief, meanwhile, backed its presence at the Congress, saying: “What does Russian football have to do with all this? What has Russian football done wrong? I don’t find any clauses in the FIFA statutes that were broken by Russian football.”
Ukraine’s video message
A three-minute video message was aired at the Congress from the head of Ukraine’s football federation, Andriy Pavelko.

Pavelko wore an armoured vest as he spoke from the capital Kyiv while behind him people packed sandbags several metres high to protect a monument.
“Unfortunately, I cannot be with you today. Since February 24, we have not had the opportunity to develop our beloved game. For over a month, we have been defending our country and resisting the military aggression of the Russian Federation.
“During this period, we regularly receive sad news about the deaths of Ukrainian football community representatives. They are killed by the aggressor’s bullets and shells, one of the biggest armies in the world.

Following the online session, Tunisia’s justice minister, Leila Jeffal, asked the attorney general to open a judicial investigation against members of a suspended parliament on charges of “conspiring against state security”, local media said.
Saied denounced parliament’s move as a “coup attempt” and said those responsible had “betrayed” the nation.
Tunisian parliamentarians voted on Wednesday to repeal presidential decrees suspending their chamber and giving Kais Saied near-total power, openly defying him in an online session, although he dismissed their meeting as illegal.

The former law professor, elected in 2019 amid public anger against the political class, on July 25 last year sacked the government, froze the assembly and seized wide-ranging powers.
He later gave himself powers to rule and legislate by decree and seized control over the judiciary in what rivals saw as further blows to democracy in the birthplace of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.
Saied’s moves were initially welcomed by many Tunisians sick of the often deadlocked political system that emerged from the revolution that overthrew longtime leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

The court said on Thursday it would ask for the justice ministry’s opinion on the request and set the next hearing for April 7.

The development comes as Turkey is seeking a thaw in relations with Saudi Arabia, which worsened after the killing of Khashoggi, a contributor to The Washington Post.
Khashoggi, 59, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018. Turkish officials believe his body was dismembered and removed. His remains have not been found.

‘Innocent until proven guilty’
Saudi officials say the murder was the doing of agents who had gone “rogue”. In September 2020, a Saudi court jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years over the killing in a trial critics said lacked transparency. None of the defendants was named.
Following the Saudi trial, the Turkish court asked the justice ministry in November to send a letter to Riyadh asking about those who had been sentenced in the kingdom, to avoid the risk of them being punished twice.
The Turkish prosecutor said Saudi authorities responded by asking for the case to be transferred to them, and for the so-called red notices against the defendants to be lifted.
Riyadh also pledged to evaluate the accusations against the 26 defendants if the case was transferred, the prosecutor said.
The prosecutor said the request should be accepted because the defendants were foreign citizens, the arrest warrants and red notices could not be executed, and their statements could not be taken, leaving the case in abeyance or suspension.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

A US intelligence report released a year ago said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by the crown prince and rejected the report’s findings.
The crown prince told The Atlantic monthly in an article published this month that he felt his own rights had been violated by the accusations against him as any person should be considered innocent until proven guilty.

‘Mutual interests’
Asked by AFP news agency if she was disappointed, Khashoggi’s fiancée Hatice Cengiz said: “If we look at it from the viewpoint of realpolitik, [Turkey’s position] did not let me down,” adding countries were “not ruled by emotions” but “mutual interests”.
But she added: “Emotionally speaking, of course, I am sad. Not because my country has made peace with Saudi Arabia and that this issue is closing, but ultimately, no matter how fiercely we defended it, on a national basis, on a state basis, on a president basis … now everything is starting to go back to the way it was, as if nothing had happened. I am inevitably disappointed about this.”
Turkey, which is reeling from a fresh economic crisis and is searching for foreign investment and trade, has reached out to regional rivals including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Erdogan said in January he was planning a visit to Riyadh – which would come at a critical moment for Turkey, where inflation is surging to more than 50 percent.","/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Khashoggi.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

“FIFA has addressed these issues, but there is still a long way to go. The migrant workers injured or families of those who died in the build up to the World Cup must be cared for. FIFA, all of us, must take all necessary measures to really implement change.”

Her speech was followed by remarks from Hassan al-Thawadi, chief of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, who said labour reforms achieved by Qatar have been “historical” and the event would leave “truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies”.
“Through taking time to understand complexities on the ground and a shared commitment, once adversaries have now became our allied partners,” al-Thawadi said.
“We have showcased to the world what a tournament being hosted in a country can achieve. Legacy is being delivered as we speak. Going forward, organisations will look towards us as a benchmark on how to utilise these tournaments to leave a legacy.
“What we say is what we’re offering them, providing a safe World Cup, a welcoming World Cup for everybody. And this is the opportunity for everybody to sit down and build relations.”
In August 2020, Qatar announced landmark changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for an NOC – employer’s permission to change jobs – that rights activists said tied workers’ presence in the country to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation.
Qatar’s Government Communication Office (GCO) has told Al Jazeera in the past that the country “has made substantial progress on labour reforms and it continues to work with NGOs… to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective”.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6N0A1919.jpg?resize=770%2C513"
