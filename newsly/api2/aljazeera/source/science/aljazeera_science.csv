Some people who contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus have suffered from a number of neurological complications including confusion, strokes, impaired concentration, headaches, sensory disturbances, depression, and even psychosis, months after the initial infection.

There were, on average, 141 days between testing positive for COVID and the second brain scan.
The study revealed that, when compared to the scans of a control group, those who tested positive for COVID had greater overall brain shrinkage and more grey matter shrinkage and tissue damage in regions linked to smell and mental capacities months after the initial infection.
Although the research does shed some light on the ongoing symptoms of long COVID, I would caution against generalising the findings to the population at large before more research is conducted.
Researchers said even though the effects were more pronounced in older people who had been hospitalised for their symptoms, even those with mild symptoms had some changes.
“Despite the infection being mild for 96 percent of our participants, we saw a greater loss of grey matter volume, and greater tissue damage in the infected participants, on average 4.5 months after infection,” said Professor Gwenaëlle Douaud, lead author on the study. “They also showed greater decline in their mental abilities to perform complex tasks, and this mental worsening was partly related to these brain abnormalities.”
The study was conducted when the Alpha variant was dominant in Britain and is unlikely to include anyone infected with the Delta variant. The researchers also did not say if vaccination against COVID had any impact on the condition.
The scans they did reveal changes in several parts of the brain after people contracted COVID, including:

Greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. The orbitofrontal cortex is the part of the brain that controls reward, emotion and fluctuations in mood and feelings of sadness. It is also involved in cognitive function and decision-making. The parahippocampal gyrus plays a role in the control of our emotions as well as an important role in memory retrieval and spatial awareness and processing. We have seen symptoms of depression, anxiety and “brain fog” where people are prone to memory issues after a COVID infection.
Greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex. This is the part of the brain for processing and perception of smell; it also helps link smells to certain memories and survival responses. Loss of sense of smell has been a hallmark symptom of COVID and this may explain why that is.
Greater reduction in global brain size, essentially meaning the participants’ brains were smaller after testing positive for COVID than when scanned before the infection.

It is not uncommon for our brains to shrink as we get older, the natural ageing process results in the loss of grey matter every year, on average between 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent, according to researchers.Sign up for Al JazeeraCoronavirus NewsletterMedical developments, troubling variants, the human impact—it’s all here.Sign upYour subscription failed.

But the study found that, compared with uninfected participants, those who contracted COVID – even those who had mild cases – lost between 0.2 percent and 2 percent between scans.
The study also found that participants who had suffered from COVID exhibited a greater decline in efficiency and attention when performing a complex cognitive task.
The Oxford study is the first study to make such a direct link between COVID infections and changes in the brain. It goes some way to providing us with the beginnings of an explanation about the myriad neurological symptoms people with long-COVID complain about, although researchers stress that more studies are needed.
We do not know whether the changes in the brain demonstrated in this study are long-term or permanent, or whether they would be the same for younger people, who generally (but not always) get milder COVID symptoms.
Since the study was conducted during the reign of the Alpha variant, more work needs to be done on those who contracted the Delta and Omicron variants to see if similar changes are found.
The timing of the study also means that the participants were unlikely to have been vaccinated. Now, with so many people vaccinated, it would be useful to know if the vaccines offer a layer of protection.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Doctors-note-brain.png?resize=770%2C513"

The report brought a months-long international scandal into the world’s most infamous hacker-for-hire company back to full circle, following reports that it was used by governments across the world to spy on activists, journalists, and even heads of state.

NSO Group, founded in 2010, describes itself on its website as creating “technology that helps government agencies prevent and investigate terrorism and crime to save thousands of lives around the globe”.
Pegasus is a spyware that can infiltrate a mobile phone and harvest personal and location data, and can control the phone’s microphones and cameras without the user’s knowledge or permission.
Some of the information Pegasus has access to includes photos, web searches, passwords, call logs, communications and social media posts.
The spyware is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity.
Researchers have found several examples of NSO Group sophisticated tools using so-called “zero click” exploits that infect targeted mobile phones without any user interaction.
This means that a successful spyware attack on a phone needs just an operating system installed or a particular vulnerable app.

Who has been targeted?
An investigation by 17 news organisations into more than 50,000 numbers was published by the Paris-based journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International. It found that more than 1,000 individuals across 50 countries were allegedly selected by NSO clients for potential surveillance since 2016.
That list includes 189 journalists, more than 600 politicians and government officials, and several heads of state, including France’s Emmanuel Macron, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

The journalists include employees from Al Jazeera, The Associated Press, Reuters, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, Le Monde and The Financial Times.
At least 65 business executives and 85 human rights activists worldwide have also been targeted.
The media consortium reports said most of Pegasus’s clients were clustered in 10 countries: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
What has the reaction been?
In a statement issued after the publication of the report, Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard dismissed NSO’s claims that its technology is used for law enforcement work.
“NSO Group can no longer hide behind the claim that its spyware is only used to fight crime – it appears that Pegasus is also the spyware of choice for those wanting to snoop on foreign governments,” Callamard said.
Watchdog group The Citizen Lab said the proliferation of Pegasus among countries with records of human rights abuses “paint a bleak picture of the human rights risks” of the targeted.
In July 2021, the Paris prosecutor’s office opened an investigation into allegations that Moroccan intelligence services spied on several French journalists. Morocco has denied the allegations.
Last November, the US Commerce Department blacklisted NSO Group, barring it from access to US technology after saying its tools have been used to “conduct transnational repression”.
Apple subsequently sued the company, calling it “amoral 21st century mercenaries”.
Facebook is suing NSO Group in the US federal court for allegedly targeting some 1,400 WhatsApp users.
Lawsuits were also filed in 2018 in Israel and Cyprus by Al Jazeera journalists, as well as other Qatari, Mexican and Saudi journalists and activists who say the company’s spyware was used to hack their devices.
What has NSO said?
NSO has denied wrongdoing and said it does not identify its clients.
It maintains that its products are intended to be used against criminals and “terrorists”, and that it sells its products only to state security agencies upon approval of Israel’s defence ministry.
It described the report by media organisations as “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories”.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2019-06-04T000000Z_1971576250_RC2AAA9CLTVM_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-CYBER-NSO.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

State television identified the launch on Tuesday as taking place in its northeastern Shahroud Desert, without specifying when.

IRGC said the Noor-2 satellite reached a low orbit of 500km (310 miles) above the Earth’s surface on the Ghased satellite carrier, state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. It described the Ghased as a three-phase, mixed-fuel satellite carrier.
IRGC did not immediately release photos or video of the launch. Putting the second satellite in space would be a major advance for Iran’s military.
US officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment and an American-maintained catalogue of space objects did not note a new Iranian launch this month. The launch comes days after satellite pictures suggested Iran’s civilian programme suffered another failed launch.
Noor means “light” in Persian. IRGC had launched its first Noor satellite in 2020, revealing to the world it ran its own space programme.

The head of the United States Space Command later dismissed the satellite as “a tumbling webcam in space” that would not provide Iran vital intelligence, though it showed Tehran’s ability to successfully get into orbit after a series of setbacks.
The US has alleged Iran’s satellite launches defy a United Nations Security Council resolution and has called on Tehran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
Iran, which has for long said it does not seek nuclear weapons, previously maintained that its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. US intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) say Iran abandoned an organised military nuclear programme in 2003.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

The US imposed sanctions on Iran’s civilian space agency and two research organisations in 2019, saying they were being used to advance Tehran’s ballistic missile programme.
‘No longer expert talks’
Meanwhile, IRNA described negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani’s trip home as being “within the framework of the usual consultations during the talks”. However, the top negotiator for the European Union seemed to suggest whether the talks succeeded or failed now rested with Iran.
“There are no longer ‘expert level talks.’ Nor ‘formal meetings,’” Enrique Mora wrote on Twitter, responding to comments by an Iranian analyst. “It is time, in the next few days, for political decisions to end the #ViennaTalks. The rest is noise.”


Mora’s comments mirror those of British and French negotiators at the Vienna talks, which have been working to find a way to get the US back into the accord it unilaterally abandoned in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump.
It also hopes to get Iran to again agree to measures that drastically scaled back its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
They also appear to push back against a constant Iranian refrain in the last weeks of talks that tried to blame any delay on the US, which has not been in the room for talks since Trump’s withdrawal.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday said he believed “we’re close” on reaching a deal, though there were “a couple of very challenging remaining issues”.
The latest wrinkle, however, is a demand on Saturday from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that Blinken offer written guarantees over Moscow’s ability to continue trade with Iran as it faces sanctions over its war on Ukraine.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian spoke on Monday by phone with Lavrov, with the sanctions threat apparently discussed, according to a statement from his office.
“We are against war and imposition of sanctions, and it is clear that cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and any country, including Russia, should not be affected by the atmosphere of sanctions,” Amirabdollahian said.
The 2015 nuclear deal saw Iran put advanced centrifuges into storage under the watch of IAEA while keeping its enrichment at 3.67 percent purity and its stockpile at only 300kg (661 pounds) of uranium.
As of February 19, the IAEA says Iran’s stockpile of all enriched uranium was nearly 3,200kg (7,055 pounds). Some of it has been enriched up to 60 percent purity – a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90 percent.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP22061071955577.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The trial director position would oversee the startup’s long-promised human trials of its medical device, according to the listing. Neuralink’s brain implant — which Musk has said already allows monkeys to play video games with their thoughts alone — is intended to help treat a variety of neurological disorders, such as paralysis.

Last month, Musk told the Wall Street Journal that Neuralink hoped to implant its device in human brains sometime in 2022. However, he has made similar predictions in the past that proved overly optimistic — including in 2019, when he said during a presentation that the device would be in human skulls by the following year.
The first in-human test that medical device makers must go through on the path to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval is known as a feasibility test. The next, after a submission, review and approval process with the FDA based on the feasibility test, is a pivotal device test.
It isn’t clear precisely where Neuralink is in the process. Representatives for Neuralink and the FDA didn’t respond to requests for comment. Generally, device makers hire trial directors early in their interaction with the FDA, to help design trials in a way that would maximize the chances of FDA approval. Neuralink doesn’t appear to have human trials posted on clinicaltrials.gov, but postings there can lag recruitment of the first patients.
Last year, another company working on brain-machine interfaces, Synchron, said the FDA had approved its planned feasibility study. Synchron is currently in the recruiting stage, a spokeswoman said.
Neuralink is also advertising for a Fremont-based clinical trial coordinator, as well as several other positions.

Meeting in Brussels on Thursday, the politicians nailed down a long list of dos and don’ts that will single out the world’s most iconic web giants as internet “gatekeepers” subject to special rules.
Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Google parent Alphabet beats earnings expectationslist 2 of 3Underwater Google internet cable to connect Togo to Europelist 3 of 3Russian regulator blocks Google News over “inauthentic” war infoend of listThe “Digital Markets Act” (DMA) has sped through the bloc’s legislative procedures and is designed to protect consumers and give rivals a better chance to survive against the world’s powerful tech juggernauts.
“The agreement ushers in a new era of tech regulation worldwide,” said German MEP Andreas Schwab, who led the negotiations for the European Parliament.
“The Digital Markets Act puts an end to the ever-increasing dominance of Big Tech companies,” he added.
The main point of the law is to avert the years of procedures and court battles needed to punish Big Tech’s monopolistic behaviour where cases can end with huge fines, but little change in how the giants do business.
Once implemented, the law will give Brussels unprecedented authority to keep an eye on decisions by the giants, especially when they try to buy up promising startups.
“The gatekeepers – they now have to take responsibility,” said the EU’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
“A number of things they can do, a number of things they can’t do, and that of course gives everyone a fair chance,” she added.
‘Concrete impacts’
The law contains about 20 rules that in many cases target practices by Big Tech that have gone against the bloc’s rules on competition, but which Brussels has struggled to enforce.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.  Fair.Sign upYour subscription failed. Please try again.Please check your email to confirm your subscriptionBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy 
The DMA imposes myriad obligations on Big Tech, including forcing Apple to open up its App Store to alternative payment systems, a demand that the iPhone maker has opposed fiercely, most notably in its feud with Epic games, the maker of Fortnite.
Google will be asked to clearly offer users of Android-run smartphones alternatives to its search engine, the Google Maps app or its Chrome browser.
A Google spokesperson told the AFP news agency that the US internet giant will “take time to study the final text and work with regulators to implement it”.
“While we support many of the DMA’s ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we remain concerned that some of the rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans,” the spokesperson said.
Apple would also be forced to loosen its grip on the iPhone, with users allowed to uninstall its Safari web browser and other company-imposed apps that users cannot currently delete.
In a statement, Apple swiftly expressed regret over the law, saying it was “concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users”.
After a furious campaign by influential MEPs, the law also forces messaging services such as Meta-owned WhatsApp to make themselves available to users on other services such as Signal or Apple’s iMessage, and vice-versa.
France, which holds the EU presidency and negotiated on behalf of the bloc’s 27 member states, said the law would deliver “concrete impacts on the lives of European citizens”.
“We are talking about the goods you buy online, the smartphone you use every day, and the services you use every day,” said France’s digital affairs minister, Cedric O.
‘Comply or challenge’
Violation of the rules could lead to fines as high as 10 percent of a company’s annual global sales and even 20 percent for repeat offenders.
The DMA “will have a profound impact on the way some gatekeepers’ operations are currently conducted”, said lawyer Katrin Schallenberg, a partner at Clifford Chance.
“Clearly, companies affected … are already working on ways to comply with or even challenge the regulation,” she added.
The Big Tech companies have lobbied hard against the new rules and the firms have been defended in Washington, where it is alleged that the new law unfairly targets US companies.
With the deal now reached by negotiators, the DMA now faces final votes in a full session of the European Parliament as well as by ministers from the EU’s 27 member states.
The rules could come into place starting on January 1, 2023, though tech companies are asking for more time to implement the law.","/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3297366f438c4f55a571df9f4965e582_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513"

The Joint European Torus (JET) laboratory near Oxford in central England generated 59 megajoules of sustained energy during an experiment late last year, more than doubling its own 1997 world record, the UK Atomic Energy Authority announced on Wednesday.

UK Science Minister George Freeman also hailed the “milestone results”.
“They are evidence that the ground-breaking research and innovation being done here in the UK, and via collaboration with our partners across Europe, is making fusion power a reality,” Freeman said.
Nuclear fusion is the same process that the sun uses to generate heat and proponents believe it could one day help address climate change by providing humanity with an abundant, safe and green source of energy.


How nuclear fusion works
December’s feat came after decades of tests and refinements at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, which houses the JET experiment.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.  Fair.Sign upYour subscription failed. Please try again.Please check your email to confirm your subscriptionBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy 
The laboratory uses a doughnut-shaped machine called a tokamak for its studies. The JET is the largest and most powerful operational tokamak machine in the world.
Inside, a tiny amount of fuel comprising deuterium and tritium – both are isotopes of hydrogen, with deuterium also called heavy hydrogen – is heated to temperatures 10 times hotter than the centre of the sun to create plasma.
This is held in place using superconductor electromagnets as it spins around, fuses and releases tremendous energy as heat.
The process works on the principle that energy can be produced by forcing together atomic nuclei to form new elements, as opposed to splitting them – which is the procedure that powers the world’s existing nuclear power stations.
Fusion is inherently safe in that it cannot start a run-away process and releases nearly four million times more energy per kilogram than burning coal, oil or gas. It also does not produce greenhouse gases and creates virtually no waste.

Scaling up operations
JET’s results demonstrate the ability to create fusion for five seconds, but longer times will be needed for the process to become viable as a conventional power source.
“If we can maintain fusion for five seconds, we can do it for five minutes and then five hours as we scale up our operations in future machines,” said Tony Donne, programme manager at EUROfusion, a consortium of national fusion research institutes located in the European Union, Switzerland and Ukraine.
A larger and more advanced version of JET, called ITER, is currently being built in southern France, where the Oxford data will prove vital when it comes online, possibly as soon as 2025.
International cooperation on fusion energy has historically been close because, unlike the nuclear fission used in existing atomic power plants, the technology does not produce radioactive material that can be weaponised.

Masood’s petition in the southern state is seen as a test case as facial recognition systems are deployed nationwide, with digital rights activists saying they infringe on privacy and other basic rights.
Facial recognition technology, which is increasingly used for everything from unlocking mobile phones to checking in at airports, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to match live images of a person against a database of images.
The Indian government, which is rolling out an automated facial recognition system nationwide – among the world’s largest – has said it is needed to bolster security in a severely under-policed country, to prevent crime and find missing children.
But there is little evidence that the technology reduces crime, critics say.
It also often fails to identify women and darker-skinned persons accurately, and its use is problematic in the absence of a data protection law in India, digital rights activists say.
“The technology is being rolled out at a very fast pace in India, on the premise that 24/7 surveillance is necessary and good for us,” said Anushka Jain from the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) digital rights group in Delhi.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

“It’s important to challenge this notion, and a court case such as this will also help raise public awareness – most people are not even aware they are being surveilled,” said Jain, associate counsel at IFF, which helped prepare the petition.
World’s most surveilled place: Amnesty
CCTV cameras have become a common sight across the world, with an estimated one billion installed by the end of last year.
Alongside Chinese cities, Hyderabad and New Delhi also have some of the world’s highest concentrations of CCTV cameras, according to the website Comparitech.
Telangana state has more than 600,000 cameras – most of them in the capital, Hyderabad – and police can use an application on their mobile phones and tablets to take photographs and match them on the database.
The state is “the most surveilled place in the world”, according to research published last year by Amnesty International, IFF and rights group Article 19, with systems deployed by the police, the election commission and others.
Hyderabad, which is home to the Indian offices of several global tech firms including Microsoft, Amazon and IBM, “is on the brink of becoming a total surveillance city”, said Matt Mahmoudi, Amnesty’s AI and Big Data researcher.
“It is almost impossible to walk down the street without risking exposure to facial recognition,” he said.
The rights of Muslims, Dalits, Indigenous Adivasis, transgender people and other historically marginalised groups are at particular risk from such surveillance, activists say, with the systems already being used to police protests.
Masood’s lawsuit, which is listed for a hearing later this year, argues that the use of facial recognition in Telangana is “unconstitutional and illegal”. It says it is unnecessary, disproportionate, and lacks safeguards to prevent misuse.
“This illegality cannot be cured or justified on the basis of its purported benefits in advancing law enforcement interests – under the guise of providing better policing … (when) these purported benefits are yet to be proven,” the petition says.
Hyderabad police say the technology has served as a “deterrent” and helped them catch criminals.
“We don’t infringe upon the privacy of any individual, as we are not barging into anybody’s house to take pictures,” said C V Anand, Hyderabad’s police commissioner.
“The technology is being used only to keep surveillance on criminals or suspected criminals,” he told reporters earlier this month in response to the petition.
‘Losing our fight to protect privacy’
In some parts of the world, there is growing pushback against the use of facial recognition, with companies, including Microsoft and Amazon, ending or curbing sales of the technology to the police, and the European Union mulling a five-year ban.
In India, resistance from students, municipal workers and minority communities is growing as more services go online and government agencies and companies require personal data and location-tracking apps to undertake everyday tasks.
A planned data protection law gives wide exemptions to government agencies for the purposes of national security.
“It doesn’t talk about surveillance, which gathers data in secret and without consent, and it exempts government use, so it will fail to provide the sort of robust protections that are needed,” said Jain.
Masood, who is much more aware now of CCTV cameras and police officers taking photographs of residents in Hyderabad, wants others to see the dangers of facial recognition.
“The state has spent so much money on it, yet people have no idea how it works, how it can be misused, and how it abuses their privacy,” he said.
“We are losing our fight to protect our privacy every day.”","/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2013-06-20T120000Z_1957904695_GM1E96K11JH01_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-SURVEILLANCE.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Up to 40 of the 49 small satellites launched last week have either re-entered the atmosphere and burned up, or are on the verge of doing so, the company said in an online update Tuesday night.

Ground controllers tried to save the compact, flat-panel satellites by putting them into a type of hibernation and flying them in a way to minimise drag. But the atmospheric pull was too great, and the satellites failed to awaken and climb to a higher, more stable orbit, according to the company.
SpaceX still has close to 2,000 Starlink satellites orbiting Earth and providing internet service to remote corners of the world. They circle the globe more than 550 km (340 miles) up.
The satellites hit by the solar storm were in a temporary position. SpaceX deliberately launches them into this unusually low orbit so that any duds can quickly re-enter the atmosphere and pose no threat to other spacecraft.
There is no danger from these newly falling satellites, either in orbit or on the ground, according to the company.
Each satellite weighs less than 260kg (575 pounds).
SpaceX described the lost satellites as a “unique situation”. Such geomagnetic storms are caused by intense solar activity like flares, which can send streams of plasma from the sun’s corona hurtling out into space and towards Earth.
Since launching the first Starlink satellites in 2019, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has envisioned a constellation of thousands more satellites to increase internet service. SpaceX is trying to help restore internet service to Tonga through this network following a devastating volcanic eruption and tsunami in late January.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

Launches have been cancelled, Mars rovers have been grounded, and engines have remained undelivered. Yet this East-West delinking might also provide a new impetus for growth.
Russia regularly sends both humans and satellites up on their Soyuz rockets. “Their expertise in human spaceflight is especially strong,” says Claude Rousseau, research director at Northern Sky Research, a space consultancy firm. Ukraine’s position is less important, yet the country has a sizable space industry. Elon Musk even declared that the Ukraine-designed Zenit rocket family was a personal favourite of his.

Concerns arose that US astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who had just broken the record for longest human spaceflight, was stranded onboard the International Space Station (ISS). A Russian news report had suggested he wouldn’t be taken down on a Russian rocket as previously agreed, in response to heavy sanctions imposed on Russia. Eventually, Russia said it would honour its commitment, and Vande Hei is scheduled to return to earth on March 30.
When sanctions hit the Russian space industry, and the war shut down its Ukrainian counterparts, the global ripple effects hit many companies, scientists and governments. OneWeb, a UK space constellation, was forced to cancel the launch of its satellites on Russian rockets. The European ESA Mars Rover project was suspended after falling out with its Russian partners. And Russia halted the delivery of rocket engines to United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed.
“Russia provides fairly cheap, ready-made launch services,” says Professor Ram Jakhu, of the McGill Institute of Air and Space Law. “Now that option is disappearing for many.”
Long-term delinking
One company that is facing this fracture is Spire Global, a US-listed earth-observation company that owns a constellation of more than 100 satellites. “The war has been a wake-up call,” says Jeroen Cappaert, CTO and co-founder of Spire.
Spire had previously launched its satellites on Russian Soyuz rockets, a launch opportunity that is closed off for now. Yet, according to Cappaert, the direct effects of the war on their business have been relatively limited. Spire, like most Western companies, had already stopped using Russian rockets after previous rounds of sanctions related to Ukraine and does not have any subcontractors in the affected region.
The main shift for Spire is that the data its satellites collect are in high demand right now. “The conflict showed yet again how important satellite data are,” says Cappaert.
Since the start of the conflict, companies like Spire have been inundated with requests for data from companies, governments, and NGOs. Spire mainly collects radio frequency data, which gives insights into ship and plane movements, but also weather patterns. Others that focus on images from space – offering insights into subjects like troop movements, economic activity and refugee streams – have also been in demand in the last few weeks. Spire has even been working with competitors to offer data for free to better manage and coordinate humanitarian aid.

The current delinking of Eastern and Western space industries is part of a longer process. NASA severed its Russian ties in 2014, apart from those related to the ISS, and Russia had already banned the export of rocket engines for a while after sanctions related to its annexation of Crimea. Many companies ended their Russian ties in the years before the latest invasion, which makes those that did not seem like the odd ones out.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

“OneWeb knew what they were getting into,” says Rousseau. “They knew the risks, but they didn’t make a decision in time. So now they had to do something drastic and cancel their launches.”
This conflict might be the last straw needed to remove reliance on Russian rocketry for many countries. “Countries will now double down on their launch capabilities,” says Rousseau. “They don’t want to be in the situation where their Soyuz launch is suddenly cancelled.” India has, for example, grown its launch capacities, he explains, Japan’s H-IIA rockets are doing quite well on the commercial market and new players like Rocket Lab are growing.
He even predicts growth, not recession, in the space industry as a result of the conflict. Private investments are going up and state investment might also increase to reduce reliance on Russian supply chains. “Space is a strategic capacity,” Rousseau says. “And during times of war, governments tend to double down on those.”
War or diplomacy
For all the economic disruption so far, the war has not extended to space, but it remains a possibility. Russia – as well as the US – possesses anti-satellite weapons, which it tested a few months before the Ukraine war. Taking out a satellite in space would create a cloud of debris that could damage other satellites. It would also represent a grave escalation if NATO or Russian satellites are targeted.
“It would be an act of war,” says Jakhu. “A war in space equals a war on earth.”
But space might also be an environment in which cooperation between Russia and the West can continue. “In space, countries have no choice but to cooperate with each other, even during war,” says Jakhu. “Diplomacy will have to continue.”
Central to that cooperation might be the ISS, on which Mark Vande Hei seemed to have gotten stuck for a short while. “The ISS is too beneficial for both sides to abandon,” concludes Rousseau. “Even throughout all the previous crises, that programme was the one that continued. The conflict is now one step more intense, but I think the cooperation will survive.”","/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-07-30T161207Z_267431051_RC2Q3I9SHRVS_RTRMADP_3_SPACE-EXPLORATION-MARS.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Using earthbound tools in tandem with their intellects and imaginations, they not only answer crucial questions like “What is the basis of life” and “What is the foundation of matter?”, but also try to provide practical solutions to our everyday problems.
In this context, it is easy to assume that in the world of science, where the pursuit of knowledge should take primacy over all else, oppressive social constructs and biases that hinder almost all other aspects of our lives are not as influential – it is easy to assume scientists can unite on common ground as they explore existential questions. The sad reality, however, is that women scientists have been forced to fight first for a seat at the table, and then for recognition, since the very beginning.

“Our dark lady is leaving us next week.” On March 7, 1953, Maurice Wilkins of King’s College, London, wrote to Francis Crick at the Cavendish laboratories in Cambridge to announce his “obstructive” female colleague Franklin’s planned departure from King’s.
Wilkins appeared to be under the impression that with the “dark lady” gone, he, Crick and their colleague James Watson would be free to go ahead and quickly decipher the code of DNA. And they seemingly did. One month later, Crick and Watson published a groundbreaking article in Nature magazine on the structure of the DNA molecule. They were immediately celebrated for their discoveries, but they seemed to “forget” to mention that the work of Franklin, their “dark lady”, was absolutely crucial to their discovery. The then 32-year-old woman had carried out a series of experiments that provided the visual template to prove the now-famous double helix is the blueprint for our biology.
Rosalind Franklin was born to a liberal Jewish family in London. She was driven to study science because of her natural curiosity. Eventually, thanks to hard work and ambition, she was able to transform her fascination with the physical world into a successful career in science despite many obstacles she faced, merely for being a Jewish woman in a man’s world.
It was the principal investigators at the King’s laboratory – all men – who made the calls, secured funding and stood to gain from any discoveries made there. But it was Franklin who did the labour and laid the ground for the discovery of the double helix. Sadly, she was never credited for or gained from her groundbreaking discovery in her lifetime. She died of cancer in 1958, at the young age of 37.
In 1962, Franklin’s former boss Maurice Wilkins, Francis Crick and James Watson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine/Physiology for discovering the molecular structure of DNA – a discovery they were only able to do because of Franklin’s hard work. Franklin was not nominated for the Nobel Prize alongside her male colleagues for seemingly technical reasons: the rules at the time put limits on how many people could share the award and nominees had to be alive at the time they were nominated. Nonetheless, none of the three scientists who earned this highest recognition in science felt the need to let the world know how crucial the woman they once mocked as “dark lady” was to this discovery. Indeed, Franklin’s contribution to the discovery of DNA’s molecular structure was not publicised until years later.
Some may claim the erasure of Franklin’s work and achievements during her lifetime was not a result of systemic discrimination, but an anomaly – something born of bad luck, a reflection of her colleagues’ pettiness or her own inability to publicise her success.
Many point to the perhaps only well-known female success story in science from the 20th century to claim that women in fact had the opportunity to be part of the scientific world and gain recognition for their discoveries since the last century.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Sure, Marie Curie did win her first Nobel Prize, for physics, seventeen years before Franklin’s birth, in 1903. Not only that, she won a second Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry, eight years later in 1911. And it is true that Curie was widely recognised for her work during her lifetime. But Curie’s extraordinary work and achievements cannot and should not be used to conceal the fact that women have long been sidelined, ignored and erased in science. It is Curie who was the anomaly (and who was married to an established male scientist who likely helped her gain recognition in the undeniably male-dominated world of science in the early 20th century).
For every Curie, and there are not that many, the history of science is full of dozens of Franklins. And perhaps thousands of other women who had so much to contribute to science but were not even allowed into the laboratory.
The world of science is still dominated by men 22 years into the 21st century. This is not because, as some claim, women and non-binary people are bad at or not interested in science, but because they are fighting against sexist ideology and policies that are deeply entrenched in academic institutions.
It was only in 2005 that economist Lawrence Summers, then president of Harvard University, publicly claimed that the underrepresentation of women in the sciences is not due to discrimination, but rather, “biological differences” between men and women. His statement provoked a furore and was widely condemned by feminists at Harvard and beyond. Nevertheless, nearly two decades later, his views based on nineteenth-century essentialist notions about gender and biology are still held – overtly and covertly – by people in positions of power in academia.
Even though women have made huge gains towards increasing their representation in science in recent years, they are still significantly underrepresented. According to research by UNESCO, today, globally, only 33.3 percent of all researchers are women, with rates varying depending on the country. Furthermore, female researchers tend to have shorter, less well-paid careers. Their work is underrepresented in high-profile journals, and they are often passed over for promotion.
To achieve true gender equality, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the underrepresentation of women in science, and the additional obstacles women scientists face because of their gender. Moreover, addressing gender disparity in science would help us better address gender-based discrimination in many other areas, especially health.
Indeed, today many diseases that disproportionately affect women are under-researched.
For example, take fibroids, a life-limiting, painful disease that impacts approximately 26 million people with wombs in the US. Black women are two to three times more likely to have the disease. Despite the disease being so widespread, very little is known about it. Women suffer in silence for years before receiving a diagnosis. If there were more female researchers, especially Black female researchers, and they had the same level of access to grants as their white, male colleagues, we perhaps would have known more about, or even have an easy, affordable cure for, fibroids by now.
It needs to be acknowledged that people and organisations all over the world are working to end gender inequality in science. Several regional institutions in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, have taken steps to promote women’s participation in science. Since the late 1990s, the Southern Africa Development Community have been allocating resources to ensure girls and boys have equal access to science and mathematics education. The East African Community and Economic Community of West African states have similarly taken steps to encourage women’s participation in science. In 2010, the African Union established the Kwame Nkrumah Regional Award for Women Scientists – named after Ghana’s first president  – and has been providing cash rewards to its recipients ever since.
Similar programmes, funds and awards have been established in other regions, from America to Asia and Europe, to increase women and girls’ participation in science and remove barriers from the paths of female scientists.
But these initiatives can only help narrow the gender gap in sciences if they can go beyond paying lip service to calls for equality and justice in the world’s classrooms, labs, universities and other scientific institutions.
Women can only take their rightful place in the world of science if societies start perceiving and addressing gender disparity in this arena as part of a wider labour struggle. We can only fully end gender inequality in science by building egalitarian, just workplaces for scientists that are free from harassment of all kinds as well as exploitative wages. Like in all other areas of work, unionisation can help make the world of science more just.
As Zachary Eldredge and Colleen Baublitz noted in Science for the People, labour unions can not only help defeat sexism in science-related work environments, but can also “offer a fundamental rebalancing of power, support for targets of harassment, and greater transparency and accountability.”
To end gender inequality in science, beyond making structural reforms in universities and other research facilities and introducing policies that target gender discrimination in education, we also need to rethink how we perceive science and scientists.
Today, there is still a belief that there is a single genius – or a very small team of geniuses – behind every groundbreaking scientific discovery or invention. And, as most societies are still more inclined to give men credit for a major achievement and put already established men on a pedestal, this results in “star” male scientists gaining fame and being cherished, while the teams that make major scientific breakthroughs possible, teams that include many women, end up being sidelined.
In other words, what has happened to Rosalind Franklin half a century ago, is still happening today, to countless women. In 1968, in the epilogue of his book, The Double Helix, James Watson wrote, “Since my initial impressions of [Franklin], both scientific and personal (as recorded in the early pages of this book), were often wrong, I want to say something about her achievements.” He then goes on to describe her extraordinary work and abilities, and, the enormous barriers she faced as a woman in the world of science. Reading this reflection, this postmortem admission of the magnitude of Franklin’s abilities and achievements, I could not help but feel angry. Angry that she never got to hear these words of praise from Watson when she was alive, angry that she had never even been considered for a Nobel Prize, angry that we would never know what she could have achieved if she was not sidelined, ridiculed and wronged just because she was a woman in a male-dominated field.
But even more so, what incensed me was the realisation that there are likely millions of Rosalind Franklin’s today, who are trying to do science and get the world to recognise their achievements – millions of women being deemed the “dark lady” by the likes of Watson, Wilkins and Crick.
On this International Women’s Day, let’s remember exceptional women in science like Rosalind Franklin. And let’s start working towards building a world where women in science are not an exception, but the norm.

Responding to the Calcalist report, Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai said the force had acquired third-party cyber-technology, but he stopped short of confirming or denying any usage of Pegasus.

NSO said it could not confirm or deny any existing or potential customers. It said it does not operate the system once sold to its governmental customers nor is it involved in any way in the system’s operation.
“NSO sells its products under license and regulation to intelligence and law enforcement agencies to prevent terror and crime under court orders and the local laws of their countries,” it said.
The Calcalist report sparked an outcry across Israel’s political spectrum.
Cabinet Minister Karine Elharrar told Israeli Army Radio that such surveillance “was something that a democratic country cannot allow”.
Opposition legislator Yuval Steinitz said that surveillance of citizens by law enforcement without judicial oversight is improper and that if the claims are correct, it should be investigated.
Public Security Minister Omer Barlev, whose department oversees the police, tweeted that he would verify that police received explicit authorisation from a judge to use the spyware.

Last month, a group of US legislators asked the Treasury and Department of State to sanction NSO and three other foreign surveillance companies they said helped authoritarian governments commit human rights abuses.
In November, Apple sued NSO, saying that it violated US laws by breaking into the software installed on iPhones.
NSO has also faced either legal action or criticism from Microsoft Corp, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Cisco Systems Inc.
