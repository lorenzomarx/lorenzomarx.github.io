Fuel is in short supply, food prices are rocketing and protests have broken out as Sri Lanka’s government prepares for talks with the International Monetary Fund amid concerns over the country’s ability to pay back foreign debt.
India, the world’s biggest rice exporter, last month agreed to provide the $1bn credit line to help ease crippling shortages of essential items, including fuel, food and medicine.
The rice shipments could help Colombo bring down rice prices, which have doubled in a year, adding fuel to the unrest.
“Rice loading has started in southern ports,” said BV Krishna Rao, managing director of Pattabhi Agro Foods, which is supplying rice to Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corp under the Indian Credit Facility Agreement.
“We are first loading containers for prompt shipments and vessel loading will start in a few days.”

But Lee’s sadness was far outweighed by his sense of relief.
“If the COVID policy wasn’t so harsh we would still be there, it’s the only reason I started looking for another job back in London,” Lee told Al Jazeera. “With all the unknowns about mass testing and quarantine facilities in Hong Kong, it’s anxiety-inducing. Without a roadmap, without any kind of timeline, you just don’t know how long it’s going to go on for.”

While the world outside China has pivoted to living with the virus, Hong Kong has held onto some of the strictest social distancing rules and border restrictions on earth.
The Chinese territory’s “dynamic zero COVID” strategy, implemented to align with mainland China, has battered the city’s cosmopolitan image as “Asia’s World City” and set in motion an exodus of foreign businesses and talent.
When Hong Kong was hit by its fifth and deadliest wave at the start of the year, driven by the Omicron coronavirus variant, authorities implemented a tightly-enforced two-person gathering limit, dining curfews, bar and gym closures, and a return to remote learning at schools. The measures came on top of strict travel restrictions in place to various degrees since March 2020, including flight bans for “at risk” countries and up to 21 days of mandatory hotel quarantine for incoming arrivals.
“I felt like I just didn’t want to lose another six, nine, 12 months more of having to think about quarantine, washouts, policy flip-flopping and being sent to government quarantine and whatnot,” said Lee.
Residents head for the exit
Hong Kong has seen a net outflow of almost 157,000 residents since the beginning of the year, according to immigration data. In a survey released by the European Chamber of Commerce in March, almost half of the European companies that responded said they were considering leaving. That same month, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce warned the city was facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the run-up to the city’s transfer from British to Chinese sovereignty.
In the face of growing restlessness from the business community, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam last month announced a relaxation of some measures from April 1, including lifting a ban on flights from nine countries and reducing quarantine for arrivals from abroad to seven days. Still, the city’s pandemic policies remain out of step with the global trend towards reopening and far stricter than peers such as New York, London and Singapore.
On Wednesday, Lam admitted for the first time that the strict COVID policies were affecting the city’s competitiveness.
“It’s an unarguable fact that we have a brain drain and some senior management of some corporates have left Hong Kong,” she said.
Hong Kong nightlife tycoon Allan Zeman says the city has to open up to revive the economy [File: Paul Yeung/Bloomberg]
Hong Kong nightlife tycoon Allan Zeman, who has been long known as a supporter of the government, admitted times have been tough.Sign up for Al JazeeraCoronavirus NewsletterMedical developments, troubling variants, the human impact—it’s all here.Sign upYour subscription failed.

“Obviously, every person you lose is a brain gone,” he told Al Jazeera. “No one is comfortable with having people leave.”
Zeman, who recently appealed to Lam to relax the international borders, welcomed the recent changes.
“We’ve got to open up Hong Kong. It’s great to worry about health, which is very, very important. But on the other hand, we also need an economic life as we are an international financial centre, and there’s many companies in Hong Kong.”
Zeman, who moved to Hong Kong from Canada in the mid-1970s, said he has witnessed the city bounce back from waves of emigration before.
“I’ve seen this happen many times – when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 and then in 2003 with SARS. There are different periods when people get nervous and leave. Some don’t come back but others do.’’
Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis in Hong Kong, said the city could lose out to regional rivals and expressed concern that the changes may be permanent if the government does not further loosen restrictions.
“One can argue the current trend is temporary, and it is certain that some talent may flow back to Hong Kong,” Ng told Al Jazeera. “However, free flows of capital and people are the core advantages of Hong Kong, which is the foundation of the current business ecosystems. The relatively slower opening pace may have given a chance for competitors to catch up.”
Businesses in Hong Kong are having to offer better pay and benefits to retain and attract talent [File: Lam Yik/Reuters]
The city’s pandemic limbo has forced employers to offer better deals to retain and attract talent.
John Klopfer, a labour economist at the University of Hong Kong, said the city currently has a surplus of vacancies, “which is tough for employers but great for workers. Employers have to do more to compete”.
“Now that job openings are back to pre-pandemic levels, workers have more options and employers have to do more to stand out – whether that’s salary, benefits, or work conditions,” Klopfer told Al Jazeera.
Daniel Kirk, associate director at recruitment consultancy Oliver James, said his company is the busiest it has ever been, taking on 20 to 30 percent more work in recent months.
“We’ve had our best performing March and one of our best ever quarters as a company in Hong Kong,” Kirk told Al Jazeera.
Kirk said this time of year usually sees a lot of turnover, as employees often change roles after taking their bonuses, but the higher volumes of vacancies are also due to emigration.
However, Kirk said the changes are not all doom and gloom.
“Insurance firms are losing some talent overseas, but they’re also bringing in a lot of talent back too,” he said. “It works both ways. Expats are going because they can’t travel and life is somewhat restricted here, but at the same time, there are Hong Kongers abroad who want to return and be closer to their families.”
Kirk estimates that about 20 percent of his talent pool is from mainland China.
“What we have seen a lot of, and where I’ve had a lot of success, is identifying Hong Kongers and mainland Chinese overseas or other Asian nationalities wanting to get closer to home.”
‘Open for business’
Zeman also notes an influx of interest from across the border.
“There’s a lot of mainland Chinese companies that have now set up offices in Hong Kong. And there’s a lot of people, especially very qualified people, coming from the mainland.”​​
Despite this, Zeman is confident the Hong Kong authorities want to retain the city’s international character.
“Once we reopen, the government will probably launch some kind of campaign that Hong Kong is back again and open for business.”
For professionals like Lee, the portfolio manager, any such PR campaign will be too late.
“Not being able to travel for work was tough and it got to a point where I felt like it was stunting my career growth,” he said. “There’s only so much you can do in terms of building relationships over Zoom.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-03-02T000000Z_1416119131_RC26US913NRZ_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-HONGKONG-ESG.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The South Asian nation is facing severe shortages of food, fuel and other essentials – along with record inflation and crippling power cuts – in its most painful downturn since independence from Britain in 1948.
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa imposed a state of emergency on Friday, the day after a crowd attempted to storm his home in the capital Colombo, and a nationwide curfew is in effect until Monday morning.
The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Sri Lanka’s main opposition alliance, denounced the social media blackout and said it was time for the government to resign.
“President Rajapaksa better realise that the tide has already turned on his autocratic rule,” SJB lawmaker Harsha de Silva told the AFP news agency.
Troops armed with automatic assault rifles moved to stop a protest by opposition legislators and hundreds of their supporters attempting to march to the capital’s Independence Square.
The road was barricaded a few hundred metres from the home of opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and the crowd engaged in a tense stand-off with security forces for nearly two hours before dispersing peacefully.
Eran Wickramaratne, another SJB legislator, condemned the state of emergency declaration and the presence of troops on city streets.
“We can’t allow a military takeover,” he said. “They should know we are still a democracy.”
Internet service providers were ordered to block access to Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and several other social media platforms, but the blackout did not deter several small demonstrations elsewhere in Sri Lanka.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Police fired tear gas to disperse university students in the central town of Peradeniya. Protests in other parts of the country ended without incident.
Private media outlets reported that the chief of Sri Lanka’s internet regulator resigned after the ban order went into effect.
The blackout was rescinded later in the day after the country’s Human Rights Commission ruled that the defence ministry had no power to impose censorship.
The streets of Colombo stayed largely empty on Sunday, apart from the opposition protest and long lines of vehicles queuing for fuel.","null"

Production at the US automaker’s Shanghai factory, which produces cars for the China market and is also a crucial export hub, has been halted since March 28 as the government launched a two-stage lockdown that started in areas east of the city’s Huangpu river where Tesla’s plant is located.

Tesla had originally hoped to only halt operations for four days, but cancelled production plans for Friday and Saturday after the authorities extended tight movement restrictions in the eastern half of the city. Virtually all of Shanghai is currently under lockdown.
The seven-day stoppage marks one of the longest suspensions since the factory started production in late 2019. Tesla manufactures 6,000 Model 3 and 10,000 Model Y cars per week at its Shanghai factory, one of the people said.

As the region’s largest aid donor – Australia last year spent a record 1.7 billion Australian dollars ($1.3bn) in development assistance in the South Pacific, as well as billions more on security, health, logistics and telecommunications in the Solomon Islands – Canberra could have imposed economic penalties to pressure Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to rethink the deal.

But as Australia seeks to reassert its influence, Canberra’s recent rude awakening raises difficult questions about the limits of its ability to check China’s growing influence in the Pacific by showering its neighbours with cash.
“When there was large-scale civil unrest in the capital, Honiara, last year, Australia deployed security personal within 24 hours of receiving a request from the Solomon Islands and other countries in the region followed suit,” Mihai Sora, a former Australian diplomat to the Solomon Islands and research fellow with the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think-tank, told Al Jazeera.
“But the new deal potentially gives extensive reach for Chinese military personnel, assets and armed police. It shows two things: there are security gaps in the Solomon Islands that Australia simply cannot fill, and that aid won’t buy Australia exclusivity even though China was able to impose exclusivity,” Sora added, referring to a 2019 decision by Honiara to terminate 36 years of foreign relations with Taiwan in favour of Beijing.
Chequebook diplomacy
Despite Beijing’s growing foothold, Chinese aid in the region has declined since 2018, while Chinese loans that Western officials have warned could lead to unserviceable debt have increased in leaps and bounds, now totalling $1bn.
Some critics have accused Beijing of resorting to chequebook diplomacy, by which large sums of money have allegedly been funnelled to political parties and actors.
Taiwanese media have reported that China gifted the Solomon Islands $500m for cutting ties with the self-ruled islands, which Beijing considers part of its territory, although that figure has not been officially confirmed. But deputy opposition leader Peter Kenilorea alleges individual members of parliament also received 250,000-750,000 Australian dollars each for their votes.
When a no-confidence motion was tabled in parliament last year after police used rubber bullets to disperse protesters who carried out looting and arson of Chinese-owned businesses, Beijing gave MPs 40,000 Australian dollars to vote down the motion, according to a number of opposition figures including Celsus Irokwato Talifilu, a political adviser in Malaita Province, the most populous province.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.  Fair.Sign upYour subscription failed. Please try again.Please check your email to confirm your subscriptionBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy 
The Sogavare government has rejected claims of bribery as baseless, questioning whether the allegations were aimed at discrediting it “for the sake of justifying criminal actions and political hooliganism.” It has also insisted it would not allow a Chinese military base in the country.
Beijing has denied any intention to establish a military base in the archipelago.
“The aim of China and Solomon Islands’ security cooperation is to protect people’s life and property safety and has no military undertones,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said during a media briefing last month. “Relevant remarks and speculations in the media are groundless and ill-intentioned.”
“Australia is not losing influence to China in the Solomons; the average person in the street has a positive attitude towards Australians because they are the people who help us while anti-Chinese sentiments are very strong because of destructive Chinese logging and mining fishing practices that have caused massive environmental destruction,” Talifilu, who advises Malaita Premier Daniel Suidani, told Al Jazeera.
“But Australia is losing influence among the current government because Australian aid is transparent while aid from China goes directly into their pockets.”
Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, a senator in the Australian state of New South Wales who served as minister for international development and the Pacific between 2016 and 2018, believes the allegations have merit.
“There is a growing suspicion of Beijing’s influence over the political class in the Solomon Islands,” Fierravanti-Wells told Al Jazeera, adding that China’s actions in the South China Sea and debt-trap diplomacy “give an indication of the insidious nature of Beijing’s intent”.

While the Sogavare administration has denied all allegations of impropriety, some analysts also believe it is overly simplistic to attribute Honiara’s pivot towards Beijing to chequebook diplomacy.
“Prime Minister Sogavare explained the switch from Taiwan to China on the grounds that he expects the country to enjoy more commercial opportunities from China than Taiwan, and there is something in this idea that China has offered a convincing narrative of economic development,” said Sora, the former Australian diplomat, who is based in Honiara.
“There is also support in the Solomons for Sogavare’s opinion that the country should not be beholden to a single security partner like Australia and is looking to expand bilateral relations abroad.”
Michael O’Keefe, a lecturer in international relations at La Trobe University in Melbourne, voiced similar sentiments.
“From the standpoint of the Solomon Islands they see that decades of Australian aid has not delivered the security outcomes they were hoping for,” O’Keefe told Al Jazeera. “So there are questions about the efficacy of the Australian approach and they are shopping around for other options.
“And from the standpoint of China, well, the US protects its citizens abroad and when China sees its nationals and investments in the Solomons are under threat, why shouldn’t China step up?” O’Keefe added.
New thinking
For Australia, bolstering its position vis-a-vis China may require a shift in thinking, according to some observers.
Talifilu said Canberra should redirect aid away from official channels towards grassroots projects.
“Instead of sending huge amounts of money to the national government to build infrastructure like wharves that don’t help the common people, they should study how the Americans deliver aid in the Pacific,” he said.
“They recently announced US$25m in funding in Malaita Province for a project called SCALE that will contract NGOs and private companies to look at new ways to deliver capital for agriculture, forests and fishing to improve livelihoods. If Australia did the same, it would empower more people to vote for the opposition, which is pro-Taiwan and pro-Australia.”
O’Keefe offers an altogether different solution.
“Australia could consider collaborating with China to meet the security needs of the Solomons rather than just framing this pact as another Chinese threat,” he said. “This is actually an opportunity for Australian police to work together with their Chinese counterparts, which is already what Australia does with American, New Zealand and Fijian security personnel in the South Pacific.
“But to do that,” he added, “Canberra would have to reset its default mind-frame that sees every move China makes in the South Pacific as a threat.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/h_55244762.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Hundreds of students defied a curfew to take part in Sunday’s protest, chanting “Go home, Gota”, referring to the president’s nickname, as they walked out of the University of Peradeniya and headed to the centre of Kandy.

“The people have lost faith in the Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government,” said one student, who wished to remain anonymous over security concerns. “We dispersed because we don’t want any violence and because a lot of female students were with us. But we will be back and then it won’t be so easy to disperse us.”
The Peradeniya rally was the latest display of dissent against Rajapaksa, who declared a state of emergency on Friday and imposed a 36-hour curfew that began at 6pm (12:30 GMT) on Saturday to quell unrest over the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.
The curfew is to run until 6am (00:30 GMT) on Monday.
But just within the first 12 hours of the curfew, some 664 people had been detained for violating the measure, and despite the crackdown in Peradeniya, scattered protests were reported across the country throughout the day, including in the capital, Colombo.

Authorities also blocked access to social media platforms on Sunday, in moves widely seen as a bid to prevent nationwide protests that had been planned for later in the day. The telecoms regulator said the defence ministry had ordered a block on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, as well as the messaging platforms WhatsApp and Viber in “order to maintain calm”.
But amid opposition to the move, including from Minister of Youth and Sports Namal Rajapaksa, who is the president’s nephew, the blackout was eased by Sunday afternoon.
The minister had said in a Twitter post that he would “never condone the blocking of social media” and urged “authorities to think more progressively and reconsider this decision”.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

NetBlocks, a global monitoring group, said the blackout had last about 16 hours and confirmed in a Twitter post that access to the social media platforms and messaging apps was being restored.


The demands for Rajapaksa’s resignation come as Sri Lanka struggles with what some analysts have called its worst economic emergency since independence from the United Kingdom. Sparked by a foreign exchange crisis, the downturn has left the government unable to pay for imports of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials and resulted in rolling blackouts for up to 10 hours.
Sri Lankans have been staging small, peaceful protests over these economic woes throughout March, but when the government announced a power cut of up to 13 hours on Thursday, hundreds took to the streets near the president’s private residence in Colombo, with some attempting to push through the barricades leading to the building.
Clashes ensued, with protesters setting fire to several military vehicles and police arresting 54 people. All but six have since been released.
On Friday, police also arrested prominent activist Thisara Anurudhdha Bandara, who was the administrator of a popular Facebook group called “Go Home Gota”. He was accused of inciting public unrest, but his lawyer Malaka Palliyaguruge described Bandara’s arrest as an attempt at clamping down on freedom of expression.
“The government can’t arrest people for saying ‘Gota go home,’ and there is no evidence to say violence has been incited,” the lawyer told Al Jazeera.
Bandara was released on bail on Saturday amid a huge outpouring of public support, including from the country’s human rights commission, which launched an investigation into the police’s actions.

Amid the tensions, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on Saturday said scheduled power cuts on Sunday have been reduced from the planned six hours to one hour and 40 minutes.
The PUCSL said it had received adequate diesel for power generation.
Meanwhile, the energy ministry said it expects to receive 6,000 tonnes of diesel from the Indian Oil Corporation and another 12,000 tonnes of diesel from the Indian government, under a credit facility. The shipments will arrive on Wednesday and Thursday, it said.
Sri Lanka has turned to India and China for financial help and is also seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
But these steps have done little to ease the discontent.
In Colombo on Sunday, dozens of politicians from the opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) alliance and its supporters gathered near the city’s Independence Square, while supporters of the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) alliance also rallied in a town on the outskirts of the capital.
But police and soldiers armed with rifles blocked the march in central Colombo, even as opposition leader Sajith Premadasa pleaded with them to let protesters enter the square.
“People can’t live,” he said. “This is a peaceful demonstration. Why is there a curfew? Is there a threat to national security? A tsunami? The curfew has been imposed to save the Rajapaksas from public anger.”
Rajapaksa’s brothers hold key positions in his government, including the posts of prime minister, finance minister and agriculture minister.
The SJB’s rally was dispersed, but there were protests throughout Colombo neighbourhoods on Sunday, including in Nugegoda, Havelock Road and Mount Lavinia.


In Nugegoda, dozens of people marched down the street, holding a banner in English that said “Our people deserve a better life”, while on Galle Face Green, protesters held up signs that said: “One family cannot silence an entire nation” and “You have no right to take away our democracy.”
In Mount Lavinia, they chanted “People are suffering, But Gota doesn’t care”, and in Kiribathgoda, people waved the Sri Lankan flag as they stood by the roadside.


In Kurunegala, northeast of Colombo, health workers also staged a brief protest against shortages of medicines, while in Maharagama, on the outskirts of Colombo, protesting crowds said the government was ill-equipped to deal with the crisis.
“Gota has to go home. Let someone who can run the country, do this,” said KD Lalkantha, a former legislator. “There are many serious issues and the government has no answer.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP22093295441338.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

“This will bring the funds rate into restrictive territory sooner, with 2.50-2.75 percent by year-end 2022.”Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Inverted yield curve
Investors reacted by hammering short-dated Treasuries and further inverting the yield curve as the market priced in the risk all this tightening would ultimately lead to recession.
On Monday, two-year yields were up at three-year highs of 2.49 percent and well above the 10-year yields’ 2.41 percent.
The jump in yields has underpinned the US dollar, particularly against the yen given the Bank of Japan acted repeatedly last week to keep its bond yields near zero.
The dollar was trading firm at 122.63 yen and not far from its recent seven-year peak of 125.10. The euro drifted to $1.1041 and could fall further should the EU act to stop gas flows from Russia, which calls its action in Ukraine a “special operation”.
The rise in bond yields globally has been a drag on gold, with the metal stuck at $1,923 an ounce.
Meanwhile, oil prices fell after the United Arab Emirates and the Iran-aligned Houthi group welcomed a truce that would halt military operations on the Saudi-Yemeni border, alleviating some concerns about potential supply issues.
Oil slid 13 percent last week – the biggest weekly fall in two years – after US President Joe Biden announced the largest-ever US oil reserves release.

Finance secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, working under the then-finance minister, the late Arun Jaitley, made the claim after the RBI opted to prioritise controlling rising prices over lowering interest rates, which would have made borrowing cheaper for businesses and citizens.

The documents, which were accessed by The Reporters’ Collective (TRC) under the Right to Information Act, are being made public for the first time as part of a three-part investigative series.
At the time in 2015, the RBI governor was Raghuram Rajan, an appointee of the previous, Congress-led government. The BJP government chose Urjit Patel as Rajan’s successor.
But the RBI didn’t cut the interest as sharply as the government wanted, even under Patel. So the finance ministry called a meeting with the bank’s newly set up monetary policy committee (MPC) to push it to cut interest rates, according to the documents. The unprecedented meeting fell through when committee members declined to attend, a development widely reported in 2017.
Ex-finance secretary Rajiv Mehrishi’s file note of August 2015, accusing the RBI of aiding the developed world through its monetary policy and seeking a probe.
The attempt to influence the central bank came despite the Modi government having amended the Reserve Bank of India Act in 2016 to strengthen the firewall between the RBI’s primary function of controlling prices and the government’s political impulse to spur growth even at the cost of rising inflation.
The RBI’s then-governor Patel pushed back, wrote to the government saying it should stop trying to influence the RBI in order to preserve the “integrity and credibility” of the new monetary framework “in the public eye and our parliament”. Otherwise, the government would be in violation of the letter and spirit of the law that protected the RBI’s independence.
As disagreements piled up on this and other issues, Patel resigned on December 10, 2018, citing “personal reasons”. The government replaced him with Shaktikanta Das who, as a top finance ministry bureaucrat, had justified increasing the government’s influence in the RBI’s rate-setting function, official documents reveal.
Different roles
One of the RBI’s key roles is to control the amount of money and credit available in the economy through the interest rate at which it lends to banks – this is the central bank’s monetary policy function. Lower interest rates spur economic growth in the short term but can also lead to an increase in the prices of goods and services, or inflation. Untamed inflation erodes the value of money in the hands of citizens, particularly the poor, acting like a hidden tax that hits poorer and lower-income citizens more than the rich.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Monetary policy is typically kept independent of government control because politicians face the temptation to create more money and spend beyond their means on populist schemes and vanity projects. In the long run, excess spending by the government harms the economy.
Differing analyses of where inflation may be headed and how interest rates should be set often create tension between central banks and governments in many parts of the world, including India. But in New Delhi, the debate took an ugly turn when the Modi government came to power in May 2014 as India was witnessing one of the highest levels of inflation in the world.
Newly appointed finance minister Arun Jaitley announced that the government would establish a monetary policy regime that would focus on keeping inflation in check with transparency and accountability. This would be a departure from the existing system where the RBI governor alone set interest rates, without an inflation target at hand.
In February 2015, as a first step towards establishing an MPC, Mehrishi and then-RBI Governor Rajan signed an agreement outlining an inflation target for the first time. The central bank committed to bringing inflation down to 6 percent by January 2016 and 4 percent in subsequent years, with a goal of maintaining it within a range of 2 to 6 percent. If the RBI failed to meet the target, it would be required to send an explanation letter to the government.
‘Subsidised’ the rich abroad
In 2014, Rajan kept the repo rate – the rate at which the RBI lends to banks – unchanged at 8 percent due to inflationary concerns. As inflationary pressures eased in 2015, he started cutting the rate, bringing it down to 7.25 percent by June. But in the August 2015 meeting, he maintained the status quo.
The Modi government was not satisfied with the cuts, with Jaitley and chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian often publicly criticising the RBI and complaining that borrowing costs were still too high.
Their public venting, however, was only a hint of the pressure being applied behind the scenes, documents show.
On August 6, 2015, two days after the RBI announced its latest rate decision, finance secretary Mehrishi wrote an internal note, asking for the interest rate to be cut sharply to 5.75 percent.
“I agree with neither the analysis nor the conclusion [of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee] to keep interest rates higher by as much as 150 basis points [or 1.5 percentage points], if not more,” Mehrishi said in his note. “An incalculable damage has been done to the Indian economy and Indian growth prospects, by stunting credit, and therefore investment,” he added.
Mehrishi then accused the RBI of helping wealthy foreign businesses at the cost of Indian businesses and citizens, claiming the “only beneficiaries” of India’s high interest rates were developed countries.
“We have subsidised the rich and influential in the USA, Europe and Japan.”
In developed countries, interest rates are typically lower than in India, encouraging some investors to temporarily park their funds in the Indian financial system to mint profits from the higher interest.
“Under the cover of being ‘inflation hawks’, the real reason for keeping interest rates high in India – at the cost of credit flow, investment and growth – needs to be more deeply thought about, analysed and investigated,” Mehrishi said in his concluding remarks.
Finance minister Jaitley acknowledged Mehrishi’s note on the file and “desired a discussion”.
The MPC finally came into place in September 2016, days after Rajan moved back to the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business to teach finance. He was replaced by Deputy Governor Urjit Patel who was also involved in the making of the new monetary framework.
A month later, when Patel chaired the first MPC, it cut the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points. In its November board meeting, the central bank led by Patel approved Modi’s decision to invalidate overnight most of the existing currency, the so-called demonetisation, in which 500 and 1,000 Indian rupee notes ceased to exist as legal tender.
Some economists accused Patel of letting Modi railroad the RBI into approving one of the biggest domestic economic disasters and denting the central bank’s autonomy. Rajan would later claim that the government had consulted the RBI during his tenure on demonetisation but never asked it for the nod.
Almost as if responding to the criticism of diluting its autonomy, the MPC adopted a tough stance in its next meeting in February 2017 when it changed the “monetary policy stance” from accommodative to neutral. That change in “stance”, which surprised analysts, was a signal to the financial markets that the MPC would no longer be open to rate cuts.
The central bank kept the rates unchanged in the subsequent meeting of the MPC in April 2017, while the government scrambled to resuscitate an economy hit by demonetisation.
Rising tensions
With Patel resisting government pressure, the finance ministry attempted to influence the RBI’s independent Monetary Policy Committee which sets the interest rates.
File note by then economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das, mentioning the decision to call a meeting with the MPC, following discussions with finance minister Arun Jaitley.
On April 10, 2017, Jaitley held a meeting with his economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das during which they decided that then-chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian and then-principal economic advisor Sanjeev Sanyal would hold a meeting with the “three government-nominated members of MPC, followed by a discussion with RBI, prior to the MPC meetings,” documents show.
In a note on April 12, Das wrote, “The idea is to convey MOF’s [ministry of finance] analysis to the MPC members and RBI. The final decision will be theirs [RBI].”
The MPC comprises three members from within the RBI, including the governor, and three external experts appointed by the government. MPC decisions, which are supposed to be made independent of government influence, are based on a majority vote. In a tie, the governor has a casting vote.
Under the Modi government’s law establishing the MPC, the government is only allowed to present its views to the committee in writing. Government officials cannot meet with the committee or influence it by any other means.
Ignoring the law, on May 17, 2017, the finance ministry sent a letter to each of the MPC members stating that “with the approval of the Finance Minister, it has been decided to evolve an institutionalised framework under which the government may, from time to time, engage with the members of MPC to provide the government perspective on macroeconomic situation including economic growth and inflation”.
The MPC’s external members were summoned for a meeting chaired by Subramanian on June 1, 2017, days before the committee was scheduled to meet. A separate letter was written to Urjit Patel telling him about the finance ministry’s decision to hold a discussion with the RBI officials on the MPC at its headquarters in Mumbai.
Three days later, the finance ministry reversed course and said in a file note that the discussions would only be informal because of the “sensitivities involved”.
“A revised letter may be sent to the MPC…without mentioning that we would like to institute a mechanism for informal discussion with them,” the note said.
A new letter was issued to all the MPC members, which specified that the meeting to be chaired by the government’s chief economic adviser is only to “discuss the overall macroeconomic situation in the country and developments in the global economy.” Any direct reference to interest rates, the real purpose of the meeting, had now been left out.

 
The letter
On May 22, 2017, Patel wrote back to Jaitley opposing the meeting. He said the RBI was “surprised and dismayed by this development on two counts”, according to the documents reviewed by The Reporters’ Collective.
“Firstly, we have not discussed the matter with each other, although we have interacted several times in recent weeks on work matters; and second, it is addressed to and seeks to set up meetings with MPC members, and separately so with non-RBI and RBI members,” Patel said.
He stressed that the move “violates the letter and spirit of the amended RBI Act (to set up an independent committee for monetary policy) and tarnishes the constructive engagement since 2014 between RBI and the Ministry of Finance on issues relating to monetary policy”.
“In fact, communication with or from (the) government should be scrupulously avoided if the integrity and credibility of the monetary policy decision has to be preserved in the public eye and our Parliament,” Patel wrote, adding that investors will “likely” take a dim view of any direct intervention in monetary policy.
“Frankly, this is avoidable as we seek, in the national interest, to nurture institutions befitting a modern economy,” the ex-RBI governor said.
Patel reminded Jaitley of the clause that the federal government can convey its views only in writing to the MPC from time to time and said that any other structure for communication will violate the law.
“This clause (where the operating words are “writing to the MPC”) was, you may recollect, precisely formulated so that, in a departure from the past, informal and non-transparent “direction” by government officials on monetary policy is disallowed,” his letter said.
Al Jazeera sent a list of questions to the Ministry of Finance, the RBI, Rajiv Mehrishi, Raghuram Rajan and Urjit Patel. None of them responded.
Das’s parting words
File note by then economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das justifying the finance ministry’s proposed meeting with the RBI’s MPC.
In the finance ministry’s final internal note on the matter, Das, the then-economic affairs secretary, wrote that an “interaction between (the) finance ministry and members of MPC cannot be interpreted as coming in the way of the RBI Act.”
“Ultimately, accountability about (the) functioning of the economy lies at the doorsteps of the government, particularly the finance ministry,” Das said in a note dated May 29, 2017, while giving the approval to send the finance ministry’s analysis of the economy to the MPC members in writing.
Das, toeing the government line, would become RBI governor one and a half years after his departure in May 2017 from the finance ministry. He was appointed barely 24 hours after Patel abruptly resigned in December 2018.
Part 2 of the investigative series will be out tomorrow.

But that is what they got on Friday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest jobs report showed employers added 431,000 to payrolls last month and the unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.6 percent.

“A very tight labour market got even tighter,” wrote Oxford Economics’ Kathy Bostjancic and Lydia Boussour.
Futures contracts tied to the Fed’s policy rate fell after the jobs report, as expectations intensified that the Fed will go bigger at the Fed’s next three meetings, raising by a half-a-percentage point each time to deal a more decisive blow to price pressures.
Rate futures contracts reflect odds-on bets for the policy rate to end the year in the range of 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent, with about a one-in-three chance of going even higher. Either way that is high enough to put the brakes on growth.
It was just two weeks ago that the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-of-a-percentage point in its first policy tightening in three years, and signaled ongoing rate raises ahead to rein in inflation at a 40-year high and climbing.
With average hourly pay that is 5.6 percent higher than a year earlier, March’s labour market report reflected strong demand for workers despite rising borrowing costs that may, to central bankers, also contain a warning signal for a building “wage price spiral” that could make inflation even worse.
At their mid-March meeting, policymakers had projected an end-of-year policy rate of about 1.9 percent. Since then a number, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have signaled their readiness to move faster.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who personally prefers the more measured path, told reporters Friday that he does not see a big risk in using “some” half-point rate raises to bring borrowing costs to neutral sooner, as long as the goal was not to raise rates much faster and push them much higher.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

The worry there would be that the Fed ends up tightening too much, tipping the economy into recession. Historically it has been rare that the Fed has avoided such an outcome once the unemployment rate falls as low as it is now.
With inflation looking set to accelerate even more after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices higher and a COVID-19 outbreak in China threatens to further damage already strained supply chains, tamping down inflation is “essential” to sustaining a strong labour market, Fed’s Powell has said.
The Fed targets 2 percent inflation by a measure known as the personal consumption expenditures price index. In February that measure jumped to 6.4 percent.
Policymakers do not want to risk that expectations for ever-higher prices get baked into American household and business psychology. Rate raises are designed to curb demand and blunt that risk.
Besides, policymakers have argued, the labour market has met the standard of full employment, and is strong enough to withstand the kind of fairly rapid withdrawal of support they are contemplating.
Friday’s report offered more grist for that argument. The unemployment rate was “little different” than the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5 percent, the report’s authors said.
And it helps ratify the Fed’s hope that workers sidelined by the pandemic would find their way back to the labour force as COVID-19 cases fall.
Participation in the labour force by workers in their “prime” years of 25 to 54 rose to 82.5 percent, the highest level in two years. Most industries are now above or close to their pre-pandemic level of employment
US employment overall is still 1.6 million below the pre-pandemic level, the report showed.
But Fed policymakers increasingly see that deficit as likely to get filled only slowly and not prone to be hurried along by keeping rates low.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nyc.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Last week, China’s foreign ministry said it had completed the evacuation effort, getting more than 5,000 Chinese nationals out of the war-torn country.

The Chinese government charged evacuees, many of them students, about 18,000 yuan ($2,830) each to board charter flights out of Romania and Poland to various Chinese cities.
Once in China, they had to undergo between 14 and 28 days of quarantine in designated hotels, also at their own expense. Faced with bills of more than $5,000 in some cases, some evacuees said they had even reconsidered their plans to return home.
In Bucharest, some Chinese citizens signed a petition on yibaochina.com calling on Beijing to subsidise the flights or provide accommodation for evacuees to stay in Romania.
“It’s unreasonably expensive. We are students,” one woman who was boarding a charter flight from Otopeni, near Bucharest, to Hangzhou last month, told Al Jazeera, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Including the costs of quarantine, which vary depending on the hotel and city, evacuees could expect to shoulder costs in excess of $5,000 – close to China’s median disposable income per capita, which reached $5,520 in 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions from Al Jazeera about the costs of evacuating citizens from Ukraine.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on March 28 that the country’s evacuation mission had been completed “for now”, with 5,200 Chinese citizens evacuated to countries neighbouring Ukraine.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

About 4,600 of those returned to China on 20 charter flights, Wang said.

The first flight left Bucharest for the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou on March 4, with the last flight departing the Romanian capital on March 27 for the southeastern city of Fuzhou.
Among the destination cities was Shenyang in north China, which notoriously enforces the world’s longest quarantine of 28 days.
Evacuees who flew to Shenyang wrote on Weibo, China’s heavily-censored answer to Twitter, that they were charged 530 yuan ($83) per night for an individual room.
While many Chinese people who live abroad or have children studying abroad are considered wealthy, the costs were enough for some to pass up the chance to return home.
On Weibo, one woman posted a video explaining she had made the decision to stay in Europe after learning the total cost of flights and quarantine for her family would amount to about 80,000 yuan ($12,570).
“Yesterday, we were making plans for what to do when we’re back,” she said in the video. “Today, after hearing the news about the price, we changed our minds because we can live a life here in Europe with 80,000 yuan.”
Thorny issue
Governments charging their citizens to be evacuated from a conflict area has been a thorny issue in the past.
The US Department of State caused an uproar in August when it announced that US citizens seeking flights out of Afghanistan would have to sign promissory notes for about $2,000, while non-US citizens would be required to pay even more. Following a backlash, the department backtracked and announced the evacuations would be free.
While China is the only country known to be charging for evacuation from Ukraine, most other governments have left it to their citizens to make their own way out of the country.
India and Ghana are among a handful of countries reported to have arranged emergency flights out of Ukraine free of charge.
Nonetheless, some Chinese Internet users have drawn unfavourable comparisons between Beijing’s handling of the crisis and responses elsewhere.
“This is not a business; this is an evacuation,” said one Weibo user. “And even if not free, a lower price would be better.”
Meanwhile, Chinese state media has repeatedly praised the evacuation effort, despite criticism of the cost and the fact that Beijing only advised its citizens to leave after the invasion had already started.
On Thursday, the Global Times described the evacuation as a “miraculously successful operation … showing the country’s resolve, mobility and cohesion amid crisis.”
Willy Wo-Lap Lam, an adjunct professor of China studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, described the Chinese government’s characterisation of the evacuation as an unqualified success as “standard practice”.
“It’s very important for them to stick to this claim, that they are super-efficient in evacuating their citizens,” Lam told Al Jazeera.
Asking citizens to cover their own evacuation expenses may have simply been a pragmatic decision, given the cost of transporting a large number of people, Lam said.
Indeed, some evacuees and social media users have defended the practice.
“Why would you expect our government to pay for you?” one Weibo user said. “It’s your responsibility because you chose to study in Ukraine, and the country has long been at risk of war since it has had a conflict with Russia.”
For Cao Shao, a medical student at a Kyiv university who flew out of Romania last month, the cost was a minor issue compared with the stress and trauma of trying to escape Ukraine.
“We think it’s expensive, but most foreign students have to pay for expensive plane tickets anyway,” Shao Al Jazeera. “Money is not a problem.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/20220309_2_52533581_74486032.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Tariffs will be scrapped on sheep meat, wool, copper, coal, alumina, fresh Australian rock lobster, and some critical minerals and non-ferrous metals to India.
It will see 96 percent of Indian goods imports enter Australia duty-free.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.

Both countries would continue to work towards a full free trade agreement, the federal government said on Friday.
After signing the deal, Minister of Commerce & Industry Goyal said India wanted to progress a full free trade agreement with Australia in an “accelerated manner”.
“Soon after this current agreement comes into force, we’ll get down to cracking the whip on the next stage to make this a comprehensive economic partnership,” he said.
Trade Minister Tehan said he was confident negotiations would advance even if the Morrison government was replaced at the upcoming national election.
Morrison lags in the polls leading up to the general election due in May.
“I have very strong hope, no matter who fills our chairs going forward, we’ll be able to … build on this ground-breaking agreement,” he said.","/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/a11a97b0fe3b49e8a24f312122c76631_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513"

They have also showed that the island’s role in producing the crucial components, which are used in everything from smartphones to medical devices and cars, would be hard to fill.

Among Taiwan’s manufacturers, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone accounts for more than half of global revenue generated by semiconductor foundries, thanks largely to a business model that focuses exclusively on manufacturing chips designed by other companies.
Douglas Fuller, an expert in technological development at the City University of Hong Kong, said Taiwan got a “first-mover advantage” and retained it by recruiting a strong team of engineers – and making sure its education system emphasises engineering – and receiving “a lot of government support” in the form of cheap access to water, subsidised loans and low taxes.
Part of how TSMC maintains such support, Fuller told Al Jazeera, is in the implicit threat that it could move its operations elsewhere.
Taiwan’s role in semiconductor manufacturing is so important that, as demand grew with the onset of the pandemic – during which technology kept education and the professional world running – economies including the United States and Germany asked for Taiwan’s help in stepping up production.

Experts have pointed to its semiconductor manufacturing industry as a key factor in Taiwan’s rising stature that helps distinguish the island from China.
Such recognition is crucial for Taiwan, which has full diplomatic ties with just 14 states, and many countries have been hesitant to deal with Taipei out of fear of angering Beijing in light of its statements that the island must be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary.
Antoine Bondaz, research fellow at France’s Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, says European countries, in particular, have started speaking about the need for greater cooperation with Taiwan, something he attributes to semiconductors specifically. “Semiconductors played a key role in making Taiwan visible,” Bondaz told Al Jazeera.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

“It’s completely new that Taiwan can be talked about openly.”
Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, Taiwan joined the US and its allies in imposing economic penalties on Moscow by playing the highest card in its deck – cutting off semiconductor exports.
The move is likely to leave Russia struggling to find alternatives, according to industry experts.
“It’s important to note that semiconductors are not just used for computer processors – they’re required for a range of other functions such as data storage, sensing and signal conversion,” John Lee, director of the East West Futures consulting firm in Germany, told Al Jazeera.
“So the potential impact on Russia’s economy is very severe if the current sanctions coalition can be maintained.”
While supply chain disruptions prompted by COVID – not to mention the ongoing great power competition between the US and China – may cause other countries to reevaluate their dependence on Taiwan, analysts question whether TSMC can be replaced in the foreseeable future.
South Korea’s Samsung, the No. 2 player, comes a very distant second in terms of semiconductor foundry revenue.  Beyond Samsung, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), also of Taiwan, vies with GlobalFoundries, of the US, for third place.
‘Cannot be surpassed’
Chien-huei Wu, an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica in Taipei, questioned whether another country could replicate Taiwan’s role, pointing to the island’s special institutions for training semiconductor engineers and TSMC’s 24-hour research and development operations.
“This cannot be surpassed, even compared to Samsung,” Wu said, adding that diversification efforts elsewhere would sooner or later run into pitfalls related to energy costs, labour costs, and the inability to replicate Taiwanese engineers’ efficiency.
Eric Yi-hung Chiou, an associate professor of international relations at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei, concurred.
“It’s not about the money, it’s not about the technology,” Chiou told Al Jazeera. “It’s about the talent. … working five days a week, eight hours a day, that will be very difficult. We have more engineers more willing to sacrifice their private time.”
There is one potential threat to TSMC’s position in the market that security analysts are increasingly talking about – the possibility of Beijing launching an invasion of Taiwan.
With Taiwan’s pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen now in her second term, Taiwanese political culture becoming more assertive of its distinct democratic identity, and China’s efforts at both cooperation and intimidation falling flat, there is growing speculation Beijing may choose to attempt reunification by force.
Most security analysts believe the likelihood of such a scenario is low in the short term but may increase over time.

Beijing has, in the meantime, sought to claim a greater share of the semiconductor market, though Fuller of the City University of Hong Kong, for one, questions whether or not it will be successful.
Fuller also expressed doubt that it can seize Taiwan’s capacity for semiconductor production by force, even if it successfully suppresses Taiwanese resistance: Facilities such as TSMC’s might be destroyed in such an outcome, and if not, their equipment requires continual servicing, including from the US and partner nations.
But Taiwan’s importance in the semiconductor supply chain would not necessarily offer a “silicon shield” should Beijing decide to invade, according to Lee.
“Most countries are not going to come to Taiwan’s defence against an attack from China on account of Taiwanese firms’ role in the semiconductor supply chain,” he said.
Fuller said semiconductors would be “pretty low down on the priority list for Chinese reasons to attack.”
Such an event would deal a blow to the industry as a whole, inflicting a short-term crunch in supply should operations need to shift from Taiwan to another location such as South Korea.
Taiwan’s annexation would likely also raise major questions about regional security – manufacturers would “need to question if moving capacity to Korea is that safe anyway”, Fuller said.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-03-10T090445Z_874247069_RC2FHS9DGSJW_RTRMADP_3_TAIWAN-SEMICONDUCTORS-TALENT.jpg?resize=770%2C513"
