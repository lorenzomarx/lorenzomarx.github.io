Ukrainian authorities are investigating alleged war crimes by Russia after finding hundreds of bodies, some bound and shot at close range, strewn around towns near the capital, Kyiv, after Kremlin forces withdrew to refocus attacks elsewhere in Ukraine.
Ukraine says 50 out of some 300 bodies, found after Russian forces withdrew from Bucha were victims of extrajudicial killings by Russian troops.
Satellite images show a 14-metre-long (45 feet) trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave was found.
Russia says alleged “crimes” by its troops in Bucha are a “provocation” and no residents suffered.

Diplomacy

World leaders have condemned the killings and called for an independent investigation.
Russia has called for a special United Nations Security Council meeting to address the situation in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appears in a video aired at the Grammy Awards and appealed to viewers to support Ukrainians “in any way you can”.



Fighting

Ukraine’s General Staff has said Russia is expected to mobilise about 60,000 reservists.
Explosions were heard in the early hours of Monday in the cities of Kherson and Odesa, in the south, while air raid sirens sounded across the east.
The governor of the eastern Donetsk region has shelling continued overnight. Russian shelling killed seven people in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, the regional prosecutor’s office says.
Heavy fighting has continued in Mariupol as Russian forces attempt to take the southeastern port city, British military intelligence says.


Economy

Ukraine demands crippling new sanctions on Russia from major Western powers over what it called a “massacre” in Bucha.
Germany says the West would agree to impose more sanctions on Russia in the coming days, with its defence minister saying the European Union should discuss ending imports of Russian gas.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP22093746415467.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

While Russia has rebuffed the allegations as unfounded, witness accounts of unprovoked civilian killings and images of the destroyed town’s streets littered with corpses have revealed extensive human suffering.
Hanna Herega, a Bucha resident, said she witnessed a man being killed by Russian troops. “He went to get some wood when all of a sudden they [Russians] started shooting. They hit him a bit above the heel, crushing the bone, and he fell down,” Herega told Al Jazeera.
“The shooter shouted: ‘Don’t scream or I will shoot!’ and they turned away. Then they shot off his left leg completely, with the boot. Then they shot him all over this side [on the chest.] And another shot went slightly below the temple. It was a controlled shot to the head,” she added.

Ukraine’s prosecutor general said the bodies of 410 civilians have been recovered so far from areas in the wider Kyiv region after Ukrainian forces regained complete control.
Before collecting the bodies, authorities photograph and document them in an effort to collect evidence that may form the basis of a war crimes investigation.
“We finally have an opportunity to register what happened here, all this will be [used] to present our case,” Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said.

“Although the bodies will be removed from this road, the scars that this town is feeling will take a lot longer to heal,” he said.
Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have accused Russian troops of committing war crimes that may amount to “genocide”.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Al Jazeera “what happened here isn’t just a crime. It’s genocide. Millions of Ukrainians have suffered.”
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply shocked” by images of dead civilians in Bucha and called for an independent investigation.
Russia’s defence ministry rejected the allegations and said its military units had left Bucha four days before the footage was released.
On Sunday, Moscow described footage and photographs of dead bodies as a “provocation” and a “staged performance” by Kyiv.","null"

The decree came on Wednesday just hours after the members of the last house held a plenary session online and voted to end his exceptional measures, which included the suspension of the chamber and the sacking of the prime minister, along with the seizure of legislative and judicial powers.

Tunisia’s justice minister launched a judicial investigation against more than half of the members of the now-dissolved parliament who took part in the online session.
As many as 121 out of 216 of them were summoned for questioning by an anti-terrorism unit on Friday. The mass investigation marked a major escalation in the president’s targeting of his opponents who have been openly defying his attempts to remake the political system in what they call a coup.
“Kais Saied planned well before last July to seize broad powers, sideline political parties, and change the system,” a democratic activist who chose to use a pseudonym, “Haythem”, told Al Jazeera. “He just suspended the parliament then not to make his intervention look like a coup”.
The centre-leftist partisan noted how the head of state has over time lost trust from the educated segments of Tunisian society and the major parties, while he continues to enjoy popular support.
‘Rule and legislate by decree’
Many Tunisians welcomed the actions undertaken by Saied, who deemed them necessary to save the country from a corrupt, self-serving elite he held responsible for years of political paralysis and economic stagnation.
To date, the president has not taken concrete steps to tackle needed reforms while he has made moves that have triggered accusations that he is taking the country back towards a one-man rule.

“He’s progressively dismantling the institutions created since 2011, destroying all the counterpowers in the country,” Haythem argued. “Most MPs now believe he has no intent to restore democratic rule of law.”Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Radwan Masmoudi, a member of the moderate Islamist Ennahdha party, observed that Saied did not dissolve the chamber back in July knowing he had no constitutional right to do that.
Wednesday’s parliamentary vote, he continued, offered the head of state a chance to step in, while being aware that it was still unconstitutional to order a dissolution, emboldened by a number of presidential decrees that he used to assume near-total power.
Masmoudi alluded specifically to Decree 117, issued last September, which suspended most of the country’s constitution, extended the freezing of the parliament, and granted the head of state the right to rule and legislate by decree.
“Right now, Tunisia is in no man’s territory. We are without a constitution and have a president who can do whatever he wants,” the Ennahdha member told Al Jazeera.
Sarah Ben Hamadi, an observer of the Tunisian political scene and Twitter influencer, thinks the president could have terminated the parliament in the wake of his July 25 “coup de force”, instead of eight months later, and initiated a democratic process to hold quick legislative elections.
“Saied has a very personal reading of the constitution, and is applying his own interpretation of the text,” she told Al Jazeera. “He’s also very unpredictable, so we can’t really anticipate his decisions, we don’t know what to expect.”
The dissolution of the assembly
Under Article 80 of Tunisia’s 2014 Constitution, Saied cannot dissolve the parliament during an exceptional period of the kind he announced last year.
Even Article 72, which the head of state invoked, does not allow him to do so. The dissolution of the assembly can only occur if the majority of deputies vote a motion of no-confidence in the government twice, and should prompt a new election within 90 days as stipulated by Article 89.

Video Duration 25 minutes 00 seconds 25:00What's next for Tunisia as its political crisis deepens? | Inside Story

Despite dissolving the legislative assembly, Saied late on Thursday ruled out parliamentary elections within the next three months. Instead, he said, he will move to rewrite the constitution, which will be put to a referendum on July 25, before conducting elections on December 17 – in line with the political roadmap unveiled last December – while suggesting that opposition politicians may not be allowed to run in future polls.
“Legally, since it’s dissolved, parliament must remain in session until a new vote is held within the 90-day period,” Masmoudi, the Ennahdha member, maintained qualifying the president’s latest move as another breach of the constitution.
He also indicated the possibility that the upcoming constitutional referendum and legislative polls may be run under either the interior ministry or the defence ministry. It is unclear whether they will be organised by an independent body. Many fear that Saied may dissolve the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE) and institute a provisional election commission to oversee the next elections. However, no official statement has been issued in this regard so far.
Parties from across Tunisia’s political spectrum and the powerful UGTT labour union urged the head of the state to call early polls after the dissolution of parliament.
More political parties have been actively opposing Saied. Ennahdha, the biggest party in parliament and main opposition force, and the Free Constitutional Party, which leads in opinion polls, have said they will reject his plans for July’s referendum.
“The danger is Saied wants to push through his own constitution, under the cover of a national referendum, change the rules of the game, keep out his opponents, and see his planned elections through,” Haythem warned.
“We’re watching a one deaf man show. The only hope is to have snap elections,” he pointed out.
Intimidation and persecution against opposition figures
Without an elected, functioning parliament in place, and in the current climate of intimidation and persecution against the country’s main opposition figures, any national voting will happen outside the framework of rule of law, analysts say. Meaning it is unlikely that Tunisians will see free or fair elections under the present conditions, they say.
Monica Marks, a prominent expert on contemporary Tunisian politics, articulated in a tweet thread how the sequencing of elections is critical.

“If Saied gets his referendum before legislative elections, it’s entirely possible new free and fair parliamentary elections won’t be held in Tunisia,” she posted. “Whereas if everyone determinedly rallies around the demand to hold new elections within 90 days, it’s possible that an exit ramp off Saied’s highway to consolidated dictatorship in Tunisia could materialise.”
For Ben Hamadi, the referendum scheduled for July, which is called to restructure the political system, will find sympathy among a population largely dissatisfied with the deadlocked political establishment.
“I believe the president is well aware there’s popular will to shift toward a presidential system of government,” the observer commented hinting at recent national surveys and interactions on social media within the country.
Results of Tunisia’s online public consultation on a new constitution showed that more than 86 percent of respondents favour a presidential system instead of the current quasi-parliamentary system.
Yet, with the government desperately seeking an international rescue package to avert a crisis in public finances, and mounting economic pain for the populace, many Tunisians too have grown disenchanted with Saied’s focus on constitutional change.
His popularity could be put to the test, as analysts have alerted, with the oil and wheat prices soaring due to the Russian-Ukrainian war amid a grinding economic crisis and food price increases.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-02-08T111233Z_1347538244_RC2NFS94L6P7_RTRMADP_3_TUNISIA-POLITICS-G7.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Last week, China’s foreign ministry said it had completed the evacuation effort, getting more than 5,000 Chinese nationals out of the war-torn country.

The Chinese government charged evacuees, many of them students, about 18,000 yuan ($2,830) each to board charter flights out of Romania and Poland to various Chinese cities.
Once in China, they had to undergo between 14 and 28 days of quarantine in designated hotels, also at their own expense. Faced with bills of more than $5,000 in some cases, some evacuees said they had even reconsidered their plans to return home.
In Bucharest, some Chinese citizens signed a petition on yibaochina.com calling on Beijing to subsidise the flights or provide accommodation for evacuees to stay in Romania.
“It’s unreasonably expensive. We are students,” one woman who was boarding a charter flight from Otopeni, near Bucharest, to Hangzhou last month, told Al Jazeera, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Including the costs of quarantine, which vary depending on the hotel and city, evacuees could expect to shoulder costs in excess of $5,000 – close to China’s median disposable income per capita, which reached $5,520 in 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions from Al Jazeera about the costs of evacuating citizens from Ukraine.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on March 28 that the country’s evacuation mission had been completed “for now”, with 5,200 Chinese citizens evacuated to countries neighbouring Ukraine.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

About 4,600 of those returned to China on 20 charter flights, Wang said.

The first flight left Bucharest for the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou on March 4, with the last flight departing the Romanian capital on March 27 for the southeastern city of Fuzhou.
Among the destination cities was Shenyang in north China, which notoriously enforces the world’s longest quarantine of 28 days.
Evacuees who flew to Shenyang wrote on Weibo, China’s heavily-censored answer to Twitter, that they were charged 530 yuan ($83) per night for an individual room.
While many Chinese people who live abroad or have children studying abroad are considered wealthy, the costs were enough for some to pass up the chance to return home.
On Weibo, one woman posted a video explaining she had made the decision to stay in Europe after learning the total cost of flights and quarantine for her family would amount to about 80,000 yuan ($12,570).
“Yesterday, we were making plans for what to do when we’re back,” she said in the video. “Today, after hearing the news about the price, we changed our minds because we can live a life here in Europe with 80,000 yuan.”
Thorny issue
Governments charging their citizens to be evacuated from a conflict area has been a thorny issue in the past.
The US Department of State caused an uproar in August when it announced that US citizens seeking flights out of Afghanistan would have to sign promissory notes for about $2,000, while non-US citizens would be required to pay even more. Following a backlash, the department backtracked and announced the evacuations would be free.
While China is the only country known to be charging for evacuation from Ukraine, most other governments have left it to their citizens to make their own way out of the country.
India and Ghana are among a handful of countries reported to have arranged emergency flights out of Ukraine free of charge.
Nonetheless, some Chinese Internet users have drawn unfavourable comparisons between Beijing’s handling of the crisis and responses elsewhere.
“This is not a business; this is an evacuation,” said one Weibo user. “And even if not free, a lower price would be better.”
Meanwhile, Chinese state media has repeatedly praised the evacuation effort, despite criticism of the cost and the fact that Beijing only advised its citizens to leave after the invasion had already started.
On Thursday, the Global Times described the evacuation as a “miraculously successful operation … showing the country’s resolve, mobility and cohesion amid crisis.”
Willy Wo-Lap Lam, an adjunct professor of China studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, described the Chinese government’s characterisation of the evacuation as an unqualified success as “standard practice”.
“It’s very important for them to stick to this claim, that they are super-efficient in evacuating their citizens,” Lam told Al Jazeera.
Asking citizens to cover their own evacuation expenses may have simply been a pragmatic decision, given the cost of transporting a large number of people, Lam said.
Indeed, some evacuees and social media users have defended the practice.
“Why would you expect our government to pay for you?” one Weibo user said. “It’s your responsibility because you chose to study in Ukraine, and the country has long been at risk of war since it has had a conflict with Russia.”
For Cao Shao, a medical student at a Kyiv university who flew out of Romania last month, the cost was a minor issue compared with the stress and trauma of trying to escape Ukraine.
“We think it’s expensive, but most foreign students have to pay for expensive plane tickets anyway,” Shao Al Jazeera. “Money is not a problem.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/20220309_2_52533581_74486032.jpg?resize=770%2C513"
