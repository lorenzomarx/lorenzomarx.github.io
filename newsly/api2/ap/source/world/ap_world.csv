In its second report released on Tuesday, the Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya (FFM) said there were reasonable grounds to believe that international human rights and humanitarian law are being violated in several secret detention facilities in Libya.

The 18-page report is set to be presented to Geneva’s Human Rights Council on Wednesday.
Violations include intimidation and harassment of activists, attacks on the judiciary, and abuse towards vulnerable groups, including migrants and women.
The mission also stated that it is looking into witness accounts of “mass graves” in the desert city of Bani Walid.

The mayor of Bani Walid, Younis al-Azozi, acknowledged that there had been abuses of migrants in the past, but said the situation had improved in recent years.
“We deny what was stated in the report … No group or organisation has visited the city for a long time and we do not know from where this group got its information,” he said.
The UN report, the second of three based on some 120 interviews between October and March, flagged grave violations against migrant women occurring in the city where the mass grave is alleged to be.
“If migrants … heard the word Bani Walid, she or he would start crying. They set fire to and burn women’s breasts and vaginas there,” a female migrant told investigators.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.

It is unknown how many bodies might be buried in the graves. Chaloka Beyani, one of the mission’s three members, said a newly appointed forensic expert would investigate further.
The FFM also investigated a raid on the Gargaresh area of Tripoli in early October. The crackdown resulted in the arrest of more than 5,000 people and in the detention of several vulnerable individuals, including 215 children and more than 540 women, the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said.
Beyani said the situation for migrants in Libya was “very, very dire”, and called for technical assistance to help Libya hold the perpetrators accountable.
Democratic transition
Alongside widespread abuse towards migrants, the UN report also focused on violations affecting the country’s democratic transition, such as the intimidation of activists, and raised concerns about secret prisons allegedly run by rival armed militias.
The findings came as Libya experienced further political turmoil, after postponing democratic elections scheduled for December. This directed fact-finding efforts towards violations, abuses, and crimes that can especially hamper the transition to the rule of law and democratic elections, the report said.
The UN found that several worrying incidents in the run-up to the planned ballot have cast doubt on the fulfilment of the obligations of Libya’s de facto authorities to guarantee freedom of expression and assembly for its citizens, including the detention by armed groups of individuals from Sirte for expressing their political views.
The UN Human Rights Council established the FFM in June and mandated it to investigate alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law committed in Libya since 2016.
The FFM’s first report in October documented acts of murder, torture, imprisonment, rape, and enforced disappearance perpetrated in Libya’s prisons, which may amount to crimes against humanity.
It is scheduled to deliver a comprehensive report at the next session of the council in June.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2021-10-12T125755Z_9957347_RC2B8Q9FHMVH_RTRMADP_3_LIBYA-MIGRANTS.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, Russian forces have attacked Ukraine’s southern ports including Kherson, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Mariupol as they try to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and establish a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Russia seized in 2014.
Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Mykolaiv, said the atmosphere in the southern port city was “very tense” following the attack.
“You can see a lot of the windows of the apartments here and in the surrounding area have been blown out,” Dekker said from the scene of the bombing.

“We arrived here about an hour after that strike. There was another air raid siren and people were panicking. We saw rescue workers running away from the site, and then we all went into a shelter,” she said.
“We spoke to one lady who burst into tears, saying ‘I cannot deal with this anymore; it’s constant’.”
“[Ukraine] has held off a ground offensive for weeks but of course, Russia controls the skies and if it’s shelling, from the sea, from the ground, [and carrying out] air strikes … that does put ground troops at a disadvantage,” Dekker said.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

There were 11.3 million available jobs last month, matching January’s figure and just below December’s record of 11.4 million, the US Labor Department said Tuesday.

More than 4.5 million people quit in November, the most on records going back two decades. Many people are taking advantage of numerous opportunities to switch jobs, often for higher pay. The vast majority of those quitting do so to take another position.
Tuesday’s report is separate from the government’s monthly employment report, which in February showed that employers added a robust 678,000 jobs.
The data “shows that the labor market remains torrid”, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said in a research note. “In a month when the economy added 678,000 jobs, the number of job openings only went down by 17,000. That speaks to the depth of the bid that employers have for labor.”
The outsize number of available jobs and quits has contributed to rampaging inflation, as many companies have had to raise pay to attract and keep workers. In February, there were 1.8 openings for every unemployed worker. Before the pandemic, there were usually more unemployed people than job openings.
The unemployment rate, at 3.8 percent, is near the pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent, which was the lowest in five decades. And there are still several million fewer people working or looking for work than before the pandemic, forcing employers to compete among a smaller labour pool.
Because of those trends, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has singled out openings and quits as a key measure of the labour market’s health and a target of the Fed’s interest-rate policies. Powell has said that the central bank hopes to reduce the number of available jobs as a way of cooling wage increases and price inflation.
“If you were just moving down the number of job openings … you would have less upward pressure on wages,” Powell said. “We need to use our tools to move supply and demand back” into alignment.
With employers desperate to find workers, wages and salaries rose 4.5 percent in 2021, the fastest pace in at least two decades. Many businesses have, in turn, charged their customers more to cover the higher labour costs.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

Inflation jumped 7.9 percent in February from a year earlier, a four-decade high.
Earlier this month, the Fed said it had raised its short-term interest rate for the first time in four years, to about 0.375 percent, to rein in inflation. More rate rises are expected this year, including potentially one or more half-point increases.
Powell’s hope is that by reducing job openings and slowing wage gains, the Fed can bring down inflation without causing widespread layoffs and pushing unemployment higher. Economists overall are sceptical, however, that the Fed can achieve such a “soft landing” for the economy. They worry that the Fed’s rate increases will result in job losses and potentially even a recession.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nowhiring.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The gap in official White House records extends from a little after 11am until about 7pm local time (16:00 to 00:00 GMT) on January 6, 2021, The Associated Press and other US media outlets said on Tuesday, citing documents and people familiar with the probe being conducted by the US House of Representatives.

Eleven pages of records, consisting of the president’s official daily activities and the White House telephone logs, were turned over to House investigators by the National Archives earlier this year, according to CBS and The Washington Post newspaper.
The records show that Trump was active on the phone, speaking with eight people in the morning before the time gap, and 11 people in the evening afterwards, according to the reports.
The gap in information about Trump’s phone calls is frustrating House investigators’ efforts to create a comprehensive record of what the president was doing in the White House as hundreds of his supporters rioted at the Capitol.
During the missing hours, Trump gave a fiery speech at a rally near the White House, then watched as his supporters marched to the Capitol, overwhelmed police and marauded through the building for hours before they were finally kicked out by riot police at about 5:30pm (22:30 GMT) local time.

Trump waited hours to tell his supporters via Twitter to stop the violence and leave the Capitol. At the rally that morning, he had called on them to “fight like hell”.
Among the unanswered questions House investigators are probing is how closely organisers of the rally coordinated with White House officials, including Trump.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

Investigators have interviewed more than 500 witnesses, including several people in Trump’s inner circle who may be able to fill in the gaps in White House records. They are hampered, though, by the former president’s claims of executive privilege over his personal conversations, which have prompted some witnesses to refuse to answer questions.
The committee voted unanimously on Monday to hold former Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in criminal contempt of Congress for their months-long refusal to comply with subpoenas.
A federal judge in California ruled on Monday that Trump’s lawyer John Eastman, an alleged planner of the insurrection, must release documents and provide testimony to House investigators.
Judge David Carter of the Central District of California, commenting on the case, described the attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 US election as “a coup in search of a legal theory”, arguing the president and his allies sought to criminally obstruct the work of Congress.
“If Dr Eastman and President Trump’s plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution,” Carter wrote.
More than 700 people have been arrested and charged in connection with the violence.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP22077581209136.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The E-levy bill, passed on Tuesday, will introduce a 1.5 percent tax on electronic money transfers and transactions. President Nana Akufo-Addo’s government has said the move will help address problems from unemployment to Ghana’s high public debt.
But for many Ghanaians, the tax represents yet another burden as they are already struggling with high living costs heightened by soaring fuel prices due to the Ukraine crisis.
Legislators passed the law after the opposition minority walked out of the debate.
“The Electronic Transfer Levy duly read today after the consideration stage has been passed,” Alban Bagbin, the speaker of parliament said.
Earlier, Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta said the government had already reduced the proposed tax from 1.75 percent to 1.5 percent after consultations, adding that it will bring in projected revenues of $927.5m.
Before they walked out of the debate, opposition legislators dismissed the new tax as unfair.
“The people have roundly rejected the e-levy and our constituents have told us to reject it, so why is the president imposing it on us?” said opposition NDC party parliamentarian Isaac Adongo.
“What is the crime of Ghanaians that now the government wants to use their pockets as collateral?”
Ghana is struggling to revive its economy from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and its high public debt is a burden. Earlier this week, it reopened its land and sea borders after a two-year closure as it lifted some coronavirus restrictions in an attempt to bolster its flagging economy.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.
