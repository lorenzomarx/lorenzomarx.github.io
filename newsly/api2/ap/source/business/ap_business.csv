Prime Minister Scott Morrison is trailing the Labor opposition in opinion polls and is focusing his campaign on economic management, relief for households and national security as the war in Ukraine and tensions with China raise geopolitical concerns.

“We live in uncertain times. The last two years have been tough for our country, there have been setbacks along the way,” Frydenberg said in a speech to politicians.
Headlining Frydenberg’s budget was a halving in the national fuel levy over the next six months, a A$250 ($187) one-off payment to six million people on income support, and extra tax offsets for 10 million low and middle-income earners.
“In this budget, we’re delivering temporary, targeted and responsible cost-of-living relief for Australians now,” Frydenberg told reporters ahead of the budget’s release.
The government is forecasting a budget deficit of A$79.8bn ($60bn) for the fiscal year ending June 2022, at the upper end of analyst expectations but significantly below the A$99.2 billion projected at the December budget update.
In the coming 2022/23 fiscal year, the deficit is forecast to hold almost steady at A$78 billion, before narrowing in following years.
Bumper receipts
The fiscal improvement reflects both a strong labour market, boosting taxes and cutting welfare, and bumper receipts as the Ukraine war and continuing global supply bottlenecks drive a price surge in some of Australia’s key exports, such as coal, wheat and iron ore.
Morrison’s Liberal-National government was forced to inject billions in stimulus in 2020 to shore up an economy upended by the coronavirus pandemic, abandoning decades of his party’s fiscally conservative ideology as public finances slumped deep into the red.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Looking ahead, deficits are expected to persist but then narrow, accounting for 1.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2026 fiscal year from 3.5 percent in the current fiscal year.
Australia has gradually reopened its borders to international visitors, ending two years of a crippling travel ban that starved the economy of tourists, foreign students and imported labour.
Net migration is expected to return to 41,000 arrivals in the current fiscal year from 89,900 net departures in the previous. Arrivals are then projected to head back to pre-pandemic levels of 180,000 and 213,000 in the 2022/23 and 2023/24 fiscal years, respectively.
That, combined with a wider reopening of the global economy as pandemic curbs ease, has prompted the government to upgrade its expectations for GDP and the labour market, with the unemployment rate seen dipping to a 50-year low of 3.75 percent by September.
Data out earlier on Tuesday showed retail sales jumped a solid 1.8 percent in February, while spending on bank cards has held up well in March.
Those brisk conditions are expected to add to price pressures, with the government forecasting annual consumer inflation would hit 4.25 percent in the current fiscal year, well up on the 2.75 percent flagged in December, before moderating in the years ahead.
Such inflation would add to the case for the central bank to hike interest rates from record lows later this year, the first tightening since 2010.","/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/d190fd2fcad1454d8ea728e94b261d6c_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513"

The proposal “eliminates the inefficient sheltering of income for decades or generations,” the White House says.
Whether Congress will approve the tax is a major question as the administration outlines its hope to tax the nation’s highest earners.

How would the tax apply?
The budget proposes that households worth more than $100m pay at least 20 percent in taxes on both income and “unrealized gains”— the increase in an unsold investment’s value. For many wealthy individuals, the administration says, that “true income” never gets taxed since it can be held onto for decades and sometimes generations.
Biden’s proposal would allow wealthy households to spread some payments on unrealised gains over nine years, and then for five years on new income going forward. Stretching payments over multiple years is meant to smooth yearly variations in investment income, while still ensuring that the wealthiest end up paying a minimum tax rate of 20 percent. In effect, the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax payments are a prepayment of tax obligations these households will owe when they later realise their gains.
This is an extremely nuanced policy. The tax is targeting the ultra-wealthy. It’s taxing gains achieved from their wealth, but it’s real and unrealised income rather than simply the underlying assets.
That’s why David Gamage, a tax law professor at Indiana University, says “It’s not a wealth tax; it’s an income tax reform.” He notes, “This is a minimum income tax that includes the true economic value” of income that can be held for a very long time.
Who would see the impact?
Roughly 700 billionaires would be affected by the tax proposal, the White House says, estimating that these individuals increased their wealth in 2021 by $1 trillion, paying roughly 8 percent of their income and unrealised gains in taxes.
“A firefighter or teacher can pay double that tax rate,” according to the White House.
Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet and Michael Bloomberg are just a few well-known individuals who could see the earnings on their holdings taxed under this proposal if it were to become law.
How much money would it raise?
According to the White House, $361bn over 10 years. The budget proposal contains an additional $1.4 trillion worth of revenue raisers, which would include a higher top tax rate of 39.6 percent on individuals and an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

How do voters feel?
The subject of tax avoidance has grown in recent years. A ProPublica report from last June outlined how the wealthiest Americans can legally pay income taxes that are a fraction of what middle-income Americans pay on their income. And a Pew Research Center study from last April states that most Americans — some 59 percent— say they are bothered “a lot” that some corporations and wealthy people don’t pay their fair share in taxes.
A 2017 Gallup poll states that slightly more than six in 10 Americans say that upper-income people pay too little in taxes.
Is Congress likely to approve the measure?
Donald Williamson, an accounting and taxation professor at American University in Washington, DC, says, “A couple of years ago, I would’ve laughed out loud. Today, it’s conceivable.”
The highest likelihood is through “reconciliation” — a budget process for passing fiscal legislation with a simple majority of Senate votes.
That will require buy-ins from West Virginia Senator Joe Machin and Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who have each objected to proposals to tax the ultra-wealthy in the past.
Steve Wamhoff, director of tax policy at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, notes the Democrats “have got this reconciliation vehicle that they can use to pass legislation” and says “this is a step toward a much fairer tax code”.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP22087692735917.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The country is the top global producer of wheat after China and has the potential to ship 12 million tons to the world market in the 2022-23 year, the most on record, according to the median of five estimates in a Bloomberg survey of traders, millers and analysts. That compares with shipments of 8.5 million tons in 2021-22, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.

The war made matters even worse because it has choked shipments from one of the planet’s top producing regions, cutting off more than a quarter of the world’s wheat supplies.

“Indian wheat exports help the market in a tight world supply situation,” said Vijay Iyengar, chairman and managing director of Singapore-based Agrocorp International, which trades about 12 million tons of grain annually. “It helps to keep a lid on global prices as well. If India wasn’t exporting wheat in large quantities, prices would have probably escalated further.”
Benchmark wheat prices in Chicago surged to an all-time high of $13.635 a bushel this month after the Russian invasion, compared with an average of only around $5.50 a bushel in the five years through the day preceding the attack.
Tightening supply and rising prices for grain from major exporting countries have made Indian wheat competitive for the first time in years. With ballooning inventories after five straight record crops, India has a huge exportable surplus. That will be crucial for importers in North Africa and the Middle East where soaring food prices sparked violent uprisings more than a decade ago.
While India has tended to ship wheat mostly to neighboring countries such as Bangladesh and to some Middle Eastern markets, exporters are now likely to find buyers across Africa and in other areas of the Middle Eastern region.
Market frenzy
“Practically every market needs to consider Indian wheat now, particularly in the vicinity of Asia, Africa and the Middle East,” said Iyengar, who has traded commodities for more than three decades. “We have not seen this kind of frenzy for Indian wheat in the global market before.”
India is in final talks to start wheat shipments to Egypt, the world’s top buyer, while discussions are in progress with countries such as China, Turkey, Bosnia, Sudan, Nigeria and Iran, the commerce ministry said this month. Wheat exports from India were already up more than fourfold to about 6 million tons in the 10 months through January from a year earlier, government data show.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Shipping times to the Middle East will be longer than from traditional Black Sea exporters Ukraine and Russia, but India is well positioned to step in as a low-cost wheat supplier, according to the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service.
Australia, one of the world’s top exporters, is already feeling the heat. Australian wheat is competitively priced, said Jason Craig, chief marketing and trading officer at CBH Group, the biggest shipper. “But Indian wheat is certainly at a lower value,” and “we’re starting to see that compete against Australian wheat in some of our traditional markets,” like Indonesia, he said.
State-run warehouses in India held more than 23 million tons of wheat at the beginning of March, about three times the level required by the government for this time of year, Food Corp. of India data show.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/385760791.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The Conference Board’s index increased to 107.2 from a downwardly revised 105.7 reading in February, which was the lowest in a year, according to the group’s report Tuesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a reading of 107.

Even though confidence edged higher, Americans are facing the highest inflation since 1982, which is outpacing wage gains and being fanned further by the war in Ukraine. That’s already causing some to limit their purchases of certain goods or services, and a slowdown in consumption would pose a risk to economic growth.
Inflation-adjusted spending data for February will be released Thursday.
Still, steady labor market gains have pushed employment back to pre-pandemic levels in some sectors, buoying U.S. households. The economy probably added close to a half million jobs in March as the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, according to the median projections in a Bloomberg survey ahead of government data Friday.
The share of consumers who said jobs were “plentiful” increased to a record high 57.2%. A separate report Tuesday showed U.S. job openings remained near a record in February.
Consumers were also mixed about their short-term financial prospects. The share who expect their incomes to rise in the next six months increased, but those who see their pay dropping also rose.
A gauge of current conditions rose by the most since June to 153, suggesting consumers had a more upbeat assessment of business conditions and the labor market. The Conference Board’s expectations index — which reflects consumers’ six-month outlook — declined to 76.6, the lowest since 2014.
Concerns over inflation intensified in March, the report showed.

The share expecting to buy a new car fell to 9.3% from 10.7%.
A measure of home buying conditions held at the lowest since November. Mortgage rates have quickly surged to the highest level in over three years as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to rein in spiraling prices, pushing homeownership out of reach for many aspiring buyers.

Launches have been cancelled, Mars rovers have been grounded, and engines have remained undelivered. Yet this East-West delinking might also provide a new impetus for growth.
Russia regularly sends both humans and satellites up on their Soyuz rockets. “Their expertise in human spaceflight is especially strong,” says Claude Rousseau, research director at Northern Sky Research, a space consultancy firm. Ukraine’s position is less important, yet the country has a sizable space industry. Elon Musk even declared that the Ukraine-designed Zenit rocket family was a personal favourite of his.

Concerns arose that US astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who had just broken the record for longest human spaceflight, was stranded onboard the International Space Station (ISS). A Russian news report had suggested he wouldn’t be taken down on a Russian rocket as previously agreed, in response to heavy sanctions imposed on Russia. Eventually, Russia said it would honour its commitment, and Vande Hei is scheduled to return to earth on March 30.
When sanctions hit the Russian space industry, and the war shut down its Ukrainian counterparts, the global ripple effects hit many companies, scientists and governments. OneWeb, a UK space constellation, was forced to cancel the launch of its satellites on Russian rockets. The European ESA Mars Rover project was suspended after falling out with its Russian partners. And Russia halted the delivery of rocket engines to United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed.
“Russia provides fairly cheap, ready-made launch services,” says Professor Ram Jakhu, of the McGill Institute of Air and Space Law. “Now that option is disappearing for many.”
Long-term delinking
One company that is facing this fracture is Spire Global, a US-listed earth-observation company that owns a constellation of more than 100 satellites. “The war has been a wake-up call,” says Jeroen Cappaert, CTO and co-founder of Spire.
Spire had previously launched its satellites on Russian Soyuz rockets, a launch opportunity that is closed off for now. Yet, according to Cappaert, the direct effects of the war on their business have been relatively limited. Spire, like most Western companies, had already stopped using Russian rockets after previous rounds of sanctions related to Ukraine and does not have any subcontractors in the affected region.
The main shift for Spire is that the data its satellites collect are in high demand right now. “The conflict showed yet again how important satellite data are,” says Cappaert.
Since the start of the conflict, companies like Spire have been inundated with requests for data from companies, governments, and NGOs. Spire mainly collects radio frequency data, which gives insights into ship and plane movements, but also weather patterns. Others that focus on images from space – offering insights into subjects like troop movements, economic activity and refugee streams – have also been in demand in the last few weeks. Spire has even been working with competitors to offer data for free to better manage and coordinate humanitarian aid.

The current delinking of Eastern and Western space industries is part of a longer process. NASA severed its Russian ties in 2014, apart from those related to the ISS, and Russia had already banned the export of rocket engines for a while after sanctions related to its annexation of Crimea. Many companies ended their Russian ties in the years before the latest invasion, which makes those that did not seem like the odd ones out.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed.

“OneWeb knew what they were getting into,” says Rousseau. “They knew the risks, but they didn’t make a decision in time. So now they had to do something drastic and cancel their launches.”
This conflict might be the last straw needed to remove reliance on Russian rocketry for many countries. “Countries will now double down on their launch capabilities,” says Rousseau. “They don’t want to be in the situation where their Soyuz launch is suddenly cancelled.” India has, for example, grown its launch capacities, he explains, Japan’s H-IIA rockets are doing quite well on the commercial market and new players like Rocket Lab are growing.
He even predicts growth, not recession, in the space industry as a result of the conflict. Private investments are going up and state investment might also increase to reduce reliance on Russian supply chains. “Space is a strategic capacity,” Rousseau says. “And during times of war, governments tend to double down on those.”
War or diplomacy
For all the economic disruption so far, the war has not extended to space, but it remains a possibility. Russia – as well as the US – possesses anti-satellite weapons, which it tested a few months before the Ukraine war. Taking out a satellite in space would create a cloud of debris that could damage other satellites. It would also represent a grave escalation if NATO or Russian satellites are targeted.
“It would be an act of war,” says Jakhu. “A war in space equals a war on earth.”
But space might also be an environment in which cooperation between Russia and the West can continue. “In space, countries have no choice but to cooperate with each other, even during war,” says Jakhu. “Diplomacy will have to continue.”
Central to that cooperation might be the ISS, on which Mark Vande Hei seemed to have gotten stuck for a short while. “The ISS is too beneficial for both sides to abandon,” concludes Rousseau. “Even throughout all the previous crises, that programme was the one that continued. The conflict is now one step more intense, but I think the cooperation will survive.”","/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-07-30T161207Z_267431051_RC2Q3I9SHRVS_RTRMADP_3_SPACE-EXPLORATION-MARS.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Shanghai, China’s biggest city and financial capital, will be locked down in two phases over nine days, as authorities seek to lessen the economic disruption of its zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19.

Once testing is complete in Pudong, the downtown area west of the river will begin its own four-day lockdown.
The targeted lockdowns and mass testing come as China explores ways to tweak its draconian pandemic policies as the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant makes eliminating the virus increasingly difficult and costly.
Last week, China’s National Health Commission issued new guidelines narrowing the geographic scope of mass testing and stipulating that local governments should complete testing of each designated area within 24 hours. The announcement came after China’s President Xi Jinping earlier this month pledged to achieve “maximum prevention and control” while minimising damage to China’s economic and social development
“Basically, this means residents won’t have to be stuck in their neighbourhoods or apartments for as long as before,” Taylor Loeb, an analyst at Trivium China, told Al Jazeera.
“Testing should be both faster and more targeted and, ideally, cause less disruption to people’s lives and business activities. This is an adjustment rather than a softening of Zero COVID. It shows that Beijing is trying to make testing less of a social and economic burden by making it more efficient, as opposed to limiting it.”

Other fine-tuning measures include encouraging large factories to adopt a “closed-loop” arrangement that will enable them to keep some operations running during lockdowns, using rapid antigen tests, raising the viral load threshold for testing positive, allocating health resources to vulnerable patients, and allowing mild and asymptomatic cases to quarantine in isolation facilities rather than hospitals.
“To reduce the economic impact of COVID restrictions, the government is fine-tuning its COVID strategy to reduce the time that activities will be restricted,” Tommy Wu, lead economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera.
“These recent developments mark some loosening of the Zero COVID strategy. China will likely continue to adjust its COVID strategy as authorities gain experience in handling Omicron cases.”Sign up for Al JazeeraCoronavirus NewsletterMedical developments, troubling variants, the human impact—it’s all here.Sign upYour subscription failed.

China’s zero-tolerance approach towards COVID-19 during the two years has slowed domestic spending and disrupted global supply chains, raising questions about its long-term sustainability. The tough approach is also increasingly at odds with the international consensus on how to manage the pandemic as other parts of the world lift restrictions and move towards living with the virus.  Despite the significant disruption caused by ongoing lockdowns and mass testing, Beijing has repeatedly signalled it is not willing to live with the virus.
Hong Kong, which is facing an exodus of foreign firms and talent over its harsh pandemic rules, has moved to lift flight bans on nine countries, reduce mandatory hotel quarantines for arrivals from 14 to 7 days, and ease social-distancing measures over a three-month period. But elsewhere in China, strict pandemic rules remain largely unchanged, leading to growing signs of frustration among a population that has largely accepted Beijing’s strategy without complaint.
Mandatory hospitalisation of positive cases has strained Shanghai’s medical system, while the recent death of a nurse in the city who was denied a hospital place in Shanghai after suffering an asthma attack outraged many Chinese. On China’s heavily censored Internet, some users have posted comments questioning whether Zero-COVID policies may be causing more harm than the virus itself.
Despite not covering the entire city at once, the Shanghai lockdown is the most wide-reaching set of restrictions since the pandemic began, affecting some 25 million people, and comes after authorities had resisted such a move out of concern for the economy.
Record surges
On Friday, China reported nearly 5,000 Omicron cases, the largest single-day surge since the coronavirus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019.
Shanghai authorities on Tuesday reported a record 4,381 asymptomatic cases and 96 symptomatic cases – leading authorities to tighten restrictions further by asking residents to stay indoors except for trips to get tested.
Last week, Shenyang – an industrial city with a population of approximately 9 million people – went into lockdown, barring residents from leaving their homes without a 48-hour negative test result.
“The Chinese government seems to have realised that its Zero-COVID policy has put overwhelming pressure on its economy, so it’s now tweaking its anti-covid measures,” Tianlei Huang, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.
“When there is less daily life interruption, there is less slowdown of economic activity,” Huang said.
Still, Beijing has made it clear it will not tolerate uncontrolled outbreaks of the virus.
“Rather than adopting a ‘live with the virus’ approach like many other countries, China is making testing more efficient. Given that the Party Congress is coming up in about six months, it’s unlikely that we’ll see a substantial relaxation of COVID restrictions,” Loeb said.
More subtle changes, however, may be in the offing.
Authorities’ handling of the virus already tends to be less restrictive the further away they are from Beijing, according to data from New York-based China Beige Book, with Shanghai’s two-phase lockdown just one example of a more targeted approach.
“We’ve now officially entered the era of Zero COVID 2.0,” Shehzad Qazi, managing director of China Beige Book International, told Al Jazeera.
Qazi said China’s COVID response moving forward may look less like Wuhan in 2020 and more like Shenzhen in 2022, which allowed businesses to resume operations within days of its most recent lockdown.
“China is no longer relying on blanket lockdowns in its metropolitan cities and is instead prioritising keeping commerce alive while attempting to limit the spread,” he said. “The reasons are clear: Chinese consumption suffered throughout 2021 in large part due to lockdowns suppressing growth. The [Chinese Communist] Party can scarcely afford additional economic pain, especially in this politically sensitive year.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-15T091600Z_1273420108_RC212T986SNK_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-CHINA.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

“We should regard the ideological and moral strength of the popular masses as the foremost weapon as ever and stir it up in every way,” he said, according to KCNA.
The Juche theory means that “nothing [is] impossible to do when the people are motivated ideologically,” he said.
Mounting economic woes
North Korea faces mounting economic woes amid sanctions over its weapons programmes, natural disasters and COVID-19 lockdowns that sharply cut trade with China, its major ally and economic lifeline.
The United States is pushing for tightening international sanctions over Pyongyang’s first full test of an intercontinental ballistic missile last week, despite opposition from China and Russia.
North Korea has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but closed borders and imposed strict travel bans and other restrictions.
Kim said the ideological campaign should focus on dispelling “evil spirits of anti-socialism” and non-socialist elements that have “gnawed away at our revolutionary position”, KCNA said.

Historically weak government finances, badly timed tax cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the vital tourism industry, have decimated the economy, triggering a currency crisis that has disrupted fuel imports and caused skyrocketing food prices.
“We can’t survive here any more,” said Indika Perera, 43, a security guard at a private company in the main city of Colombo who earns 42,000 rupees ($155) a month.
Groceries that cost Perera about 10,000 rupees a month before the coronavirus struck, now cost half his salary.
He said he struggled to feed his three children anything more than plain rice once a day. On good days, he gets them a small fish, their only source of protein, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at his one-room home.
“Sometimes my wife and I starve,” said Perera, who tried a short stint as a waiter for a few nights but soon gave up after he fell asleep on his day job.

Every day, motorists line up at fuel pumps at the break of dawn and wait hours until they open. Some leave jerry cans and gas cylinders to hold their spots in snaking queues as they wait their turns in the shade.
Police said a man was stabbed to death on March 21 in an argument with the driver of a three-wheeled vehicle while, last week, four elderly men died while queuing to buy fuel in the sweltering heat.
The military posted soldiers at hundreds of gas stations on March 22 after complaints of stockpiling and inefficient distribution, and farmers and fishermen have joined a growing wave of protests.

Without enough dollars to pay for paper and ink, authorities indefinitely postponed term tests for millions of students.
“This is unprecedented. Unlike before, we can’t ask people to donate money because everybody is hit by this crisis in one way or the other,” said N M Ameen, president of Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, which has been helping the poor with donations.
‘Life or death’
While Sri Lanka was in economic trouble even before COVID-19, with struggles to pay foreign debt and slow growth, the series of lockdowns dealt a major blow to the informal sector, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the country’s workforce.
Job losses and reduced earnings increased poverty in the country of 22 million.
The share of those considered poor, based on a daily income of $3.20, was estimated to have grown to 11.7 percent in 2020 – or more than half a million people – from 9.2 percent a year before, according to the World Bank.
Central bank data shows that the government had identified 5 million families with the “fragile financial status of low-income households” and provided them with a 5,000 rupee allowance during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
But that helped only briefly, with the latest economic crash – compounded by the Russia-Ukraine conflict that has led to a steep rise in oil prices – serving another gut punch and making scenes of desperation and panic more and more common.

Sri Lanka will seek World Bank assistance in addition to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue plan to be discussed next month. It has already received financial support from China and India in the form of credit lines and currency swaps.
Many Sri Lankans said they now opt for cheaper foods while cutting entertainment bills, such as on eating out, to zero.
Others said they pruned the costs of their children’s education, including private tuitions.
With doctor’s visits too expensive, several said they had resorted to self-medication, a practice the World Health Organization (WHO) says can lead to higher morbidity.
“We have no option,” said S Mallika, 47, a mother-of-two and her family’s breadwinner.
“Unless we feel it is a life-or-death situation, we don’t seek medical advice … We have our own ways to manage,” said Mallika, who earns daily wages as a maid and has seen her earnings fall when her cash-strapped employers laid her off.
Her daughter, 18, dropped out of school in search of a job in Sri Lanka’s garment industry – its second-largest foreign exchange earner.
Many others are trying to make ends meet by donning multiple hats.
“I only sleep one hour on weekdays,” said J M F Ahamed, 52, a retired government official who works at a private firm during the day and by night ferries people around in his tuk-tuk because his 23,000 rupee pension barely sustains his family.
