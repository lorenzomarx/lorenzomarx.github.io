Algeria has continued to remain deeply concerned about President Joe Biden’s refusal to reverse his predecessor Donald Trump’s recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara. Equally, Morocco has been frustrated that Biden does not intend to go beyond Trump’s “recognition”.

Amid the rising tensions and frustration, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken included Morocco, where he arrived on Monday, and Algeria, where he’s expected on Wednesday, in his tour of the Middle East and North Africa.

Divisions over Western Sahara
Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that has been largely controlled by Morocco since 1979, has long been a sore point Algerian-Moroccan relations, with Algeria supporting Western Sahara’s independence movement, the Polisario Front.
Trump’s recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed territory, at the same time as Morocco agreed to normalise relations with Israel, has exacerbated tensions between Algeria and Morocco.
Although the Biden administration has not released any statement rolling back Trump’s decision, there is a sense that Washington is eager to return to a more neutral position in an attempt to broker an accord between Algiers and Rabat.
“The US stance is hesitant over the issue of Western Sahara despite Trump’s announcement of recognition of Moroccan sovereignty,” Mohamed Mayaara, an activist and the head of the Western Saharan publication Equipe Media, told Al Jazeera.
According to Mayaara, Blinken will seek to balance Morocco and Algeria’s frustrations “in a manner that does not jeopardise Rabat’s normalisation with Tel Aviv, but that creates new momentum in the issue of the Western Sahara without alienating Algeria, and by extension the Polisario movement”.

“Blinken’s visit will reaffirm the diplomatic gains made by Morocco on the issue of the Western Sahara,” said Moroccan journalist Mohamed Salem Abdel-Fattah.
Spain withdrawing its support for a referendum in Western Sahara about its sovereignty has been a major coup for Morocco. Instead, the Spanish government announced on March 18 that it supported Rabat’s proposal to grant autonomous status to Western Sahara, but for it to remain under Moroccan control.
Abdel-Fattah expected Rabat to press Blinken to build on Trump’s recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed territories, and Spain’s new position, by “proposing once more the idea of granting autonomy to the region as a viable solution within the framework of US foreign policy and United Nations efforts”.
Russian gas alternatives
Europe’s over-reliance on Russian gas, and the limitations that has imposed on Europe in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, is also on the agenda. The US has already sought to encourage Middle East nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to increase their oil and gas exports, and Blinken’s visit to Algiers, in particular, is likely driven by similar aims.
“The reason for [Blinken’s] visit is to quickly convince Algeria to become an alternative gas supplier to Russia, and thereby reduce Europe’s dependency on Moscow for its energy needs,” Idris Attiya, professor of international relations and political science at the University of Algiers, told Al Jazeera.
Algeria is already Europe’s third-largest supplier of gas, accounting for 11 percent of Europe’s gas imports. While the state oil and gas company Sonatrach has said it is willing to increase supplies to Europe, there are questions about whether Algeria has the capacity to increase production.
Moreover, production capacity is not the only issue, as Algeria has found itself attempting to maintain a balance between Russia and the US.
“Despite Algeria insisting on multiple occasions that it is a neutral party in the war on Ukraine, and has even offered to mediate between the two parties, there is a sense in Washington that Algeria is traditionally closer to Moscow than it is the US,” said Attiya. “The other dynamic of Blinken’s visit is [therefore] to try to pull Algeria away from Russia.”
Even though Morocco is not a prominent supplier of oil and gas, the commodities are an important part of Blinken’s trip to Rabat.
Morocco has been a vital conduit for the delivery of Algerian gas via pipelines that run through Morocco and onto Spain. After the suspension of diplomatic ties between Algeria and Morocco, Algiers decided to not renew the deal to use the Maghreb-Europe gas pipelines in November, forcing Spain to only import Algerian gas using a direct pipeline, and ultimately reducing the quantity of Algerian gas flowing into Europe.
“Blinken will seek to reconcile the two neighbours, [at least to the extent] whereby Algeria decides to restore delivery through Morocco’s pipelines,” said Abdel-Fattah.
Abdel-Fattah also believed that Blinken will discuss with his Moroccan counterparts the possibility a political accord between factions in Libya, hoping to “achieve stability” in Libya’s energy sector.
Oil production in Libya has dropped significantly as individual factions have continued to jostle for power following the failure to hold elections in December.
Morocco hosted the United Nations-backed dialogue that produced the Skhirat agreement in 2015, which led to Libya’s Government of National Unity. The hope is that a similar process can be replicated in, or with the help of, Rabat, in a bid to broker a new political accord.","/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2016-11-03T120000Z_2076149131_S1BEUKRIIHAC_RTRMADP_3_WESTERNSAHARA-DISPUTE.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

On the Ukrainian side, negotiators said they were willing to agree to a neutral status – one of Russia’s key demands – if an international agreement under which other countries would serve as guarantors of Ukraine’s security would come into place.
“We want an international mechanism of security guarantees where guarantor countries will act in a similar way to NATO’s article number five – and even more firmly,” David Arakhamia, a Ukrainian negotiator, told reporters.
Arakhamia said a meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents is possible, and that before any final agreement with Russia, there needs to be full peace across Ukraine.

Turkey hails ‘significant progress’
Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the talks at the Dolmabahce Palace on the Bosphorus strait marked “most significant progress” since war broke out between the two countries.
Speaking after the three-hour talks concluded, Cavusoglu said the discussions represented “the most significant progress since negotiations began” following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Talks would not resume on Wednesday, he added.
Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Moscow, said Russia’s announcement could be the “most significant by the Russian military” since President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine last month.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

This is an indication “there has been major progress in the talks” between Moscow and Kyiv, Ahelbarra said.
He added the move would send a “message to the Ukrainians that Russia has no intentions whatsoever to mass troops or move troops in the future to try and take over Kyiv”.

In a speech in advance of the talks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the delegations they had a “historic responsibility” to stop the fighting, and that progress would pave the way for a meeting of the countries’ two leaders.
Ukrainian television said the meeting began with “a cold welcome” and no handshake between the delegations.
Neither side has budged over Russia’s territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Moscow has demanded Kyiv cede to pro-Russian separatists.
Previous rounds of Russia-Ukraine talks, held in person in Belarus or by video, failed to make progress on ending a more-than-month-long war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes – including almost four million from their country.

Abramovich in attendance
NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate the conflict. While calling Moscow’s invasion unacceptable, Ankara has also opposed the Western sanctions.
The talks were attended by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who has been sanctioned by the West over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has said Abramovich played an early role in peace talks but that the process was now up to negotiating teams.
According to the Wall Street Journal and the investigative outlet Bellingcat, which cited people familiar with the matter, Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning earlier this month after a meeting in Kyiv.
Ukrainian officials poured cold water on the report.

The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Abramovich and other Russian billionaires, as well as Russian companies and Russian officials, in a bid to force Putin to withdraw from Ukraine.
While calling Russia’s invasion unprovoked, Turkey has said it opposes sanctions imposed by its NATO allies on principle.
Its potential as a safe haven for Russian investment raises risks for Turkey’s government, banks and businesses that could face tough decisions and penalties if the United States and others ramp up pressure on Moscow with broader “secondary” sanctions.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220329_2_52840402_75232135-1.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

As the European Union’s negotiations coordinator, Enrique Mora, met with Iranian officials in Tehran on Sunday, the discourse there and elsewhere was dominated by whether the United States will lift its “foreign terrorist organisation” (FTO) designation of the IRGC.

In an interview with state television on Saturday, Amirabdollahian had confirmed that the FTO designation, in addition to sanctions imposed on IRGC subsidiaries and entities, is the main remaining obstacle to an agreement.
The diplomat said senior IRGC commanders have told him the talks should not be stalled by the issue of the designation if an agreement is within reach, but he vowed that in spite of this “self-sacrifice”, he would not grant concessions on this issue.
‘Most designated in the world’
The issue of the terror designation was also discussed at the Doha Forum international conference on Sunday where both Iranian and American officials were present.
Former Iranian foreign minister, Khamal Kharrazi, told the forum that the designation needs to be lifted and that several IRGC entities need to be delisted as they are integral to the Iranian economy.
Speaking after Kharrazi, US Special Iran Envoy Robert Malley said the final hurdles are difficult to clear and he is not confident a deal is imminent, but a restored JCPOA would benefit Iran, the US and the region.
He also pointed out that even if the FTO designation is lifted, other designations targeting the IRGC will remain in place.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was questioned about the IRGC’s designation during a press conference with his Israeli counterpart, Yair Lapid.
Asked if the IRGC is a “foreign terrorist organisation”, Blinken said it is “probably the most designated organisation – one way or another – in the world among the organisations that we designate, including the foreign terrorist organisation designation”.
Lapid was more direct unequivocally calling the IRGC a “terror organisation that should be dealt as such”, adding that the IRGC has “proxies” across the region that include the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.
Both reiterated their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
The US top diplomat said “the return to full implementation” of the nuclear deal was “the best way” to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme since the unilateral withdrawal of the US from the JCPOA in 2018 but has maintained that it will never seek a nuclear weapon.","/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/000_9CQ22L-e1624447966570.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

“The mine has been secured … and an intervention launched to neutralise it,” it said.
First mine stopped sea traffic
The first mine was defused by the Turkish navy on Saturday, after a fisherman had reported seeing it about 2km (1.2 miles) off Rumelifeneri, on the entrance of the Bosphorus north of Istanbul.
Turkey briefly halted sea traffic in the area before reopening the Bosphorus after expert teams neutralised the mine.

Ankara had spoken to Ukrainian and Russian authorities to follow up “coordination on this subject”, Hulusi Akar, Turkey’s defence minister, said at the time.
The war in Ukraine began on February 24 when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full invasion of the neighbouring country. Thousands of people have been killed and more than 10 million forced from their homes, including some 3.5 million who have fled abroad. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators meanwhile are expected to resume talks in Istanbul either later on Monday or Tuesday.
In its warning on March 19, Russia’s FSB security service said that “dilapidated” mines that Ukrainians had deployed against its forces in the war had broken from their cables and were floating in the Black Sea, according to the AFP news agency.

The Palestinians were not invited to the summit, despite their ongoing occupation at the hands of Israel being a central feature of Arab-Israeli relations for the last 50 years.
“Just a few years ago this gathering would have been impossible to imagine,” Blinken said. “The United States has and will continue to strongly support a process that is transforming the region and beyond.”
The UAE and Bahrain formed ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, brokered by former US President Donald Trump. Morocco then re-established relations with Israel under a separate Trump-brokered agreement.
“We are here today because we genuinely, sincerely and deeply believe in peace,” Morocco’s Nasser Bourita said. “Not that kind of passive peace where we turn our backs to each other and peacefully ignore each other.”
“We believe in a thorough, fruitful, paradigm-shaping, and value-creating peace in this region,” he added.
Jordan was the only Arab country to have normalised relations with Israel to not attend the summit. The country’s King Abdullah instead visited the Israeli-occupied West Bank in solidarity with the Palestinians.

Alliance against Iran
The gathering comes as the Biden administration has been working to renew the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.

All the ministers expressed misgivings over Iranian behaviour across the region and the possible renewal of the international nuclear accord with Iran.
Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said the group was “making history” as he announced the gathering would become an annual event.
“Creating a new regional architecture intimidates and deters our common enemies, first and foremost Iran,” Lapid said.
“They certainly have something to fear.”

Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said the summit is a reflection of the two worlds of rhetoric and reality.
“The rhetoric was singing Kumbaya,” he said. “The reality is people living under occupation. We have four Arab ministers who wouldn’t even dare go to the occupied Palestinian territory, partly out of shame and partly out of guilt, because they are normalising relations on the back of Palestinians.”
The reason for the meeting, Bishara went on to say, is that Israel, the US, and the four Arab countries want to form an axis against Iran.
“What they are preparing for behind the podium is a new cold war,” he said.

Palestinian Authority excluded
Meanwhile, Palestinians were notable absentees in the summit.
The Biden administration has urged Israel and the Palestinians to take steps to reduce tensions and create conditions for eventually renewing peace talks. But it has made it clear that it has no immediate plans to press the sides to renew negotiations.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads a patchwork coalition of parties that have little in common, has said he opposes a Palestinian state and has no intention to restart peace talks. Instead, he has called for steps to improve economic conditions for the Palestinians to help reduce tensions and maintain calm.
Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said for Palestinians, these talks “seem like a luxury” as long as they are under occupation.
“The discussions that Palestinians want on the table now are not discussions about diffusing tension or having better life conditions for Palestinians, but rather they want to engage in a peace process that ends the occupation and leads Palestinians towards a state,” she said, speaking from the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah.
Ibrahim went on to say that there is a lot of disappointment amongst Palestinians watching Arab nations normalize relations with Israel and attending meetings and summits there.
“There is a feeling that while the Arab nations are with the Palestinians, they feel betrayed by the Arab regimes,” she said.
Jordan’s King Abdullah, whose government declined to participate in the foreign ministers’ meeting, instead visited the Israeli-occupied West Bank in solidarity with the Palestinians.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP22087328562035.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are all expected to follow Saudi Arabia’s sighting of the new moon.
Other countries have independent sightings, but Indonesia, Lebanon, Morocco and Syria are also likely to begin fasting starting Saturday, while countries further east and west will commence as the moon is sighted.
When can we see the new moon?
(Al Jazeera)
According to Crescent Moon Watch, a moon tracker run by the United Kingdom’s Nautical Almanac Office, Ramadan’s new moon will arrive on April 1 at 06:24 GMT. On that day, the moon might be visible in parts of North, Central, and South America. On April 2, the moon will be easily visible in most parts of the world.
The actual visibility of the crescent will depend on factors such as atmospheric conditions, cloudiness and the distance between the sun and the moon on the horizon.

Lunar months last between 29 and 30 days, depending on the sighting of the new moon on the 29th night of each month. If the new moon is not visible, the month lasts 30 days.

Why is Ramadan holy?
Muslims believe that Ramadan is the month in which the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years ago.
Throughout the month, observing Muslims fast from just before the sunrise, or Fajr, prayer to the sunset prayer, Maghrib.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage NewsletterUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America's geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.Sign upYour subscription failed. Please try again.Please check your email to confirm your subscriptionBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy 
The fast entails abstinence from eating, drinking, smoking, and sexual relations to achieve greater “taqwa”, or consciousness of God.
Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith, daily prayers, charity, and performing the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca if physically and financially capable.
In many Muslim-majority countries, working hours are reduced, and many restaurants are closed during fasting hours.
Languages from various Muslim majority nations have a personalised greeting in their native languages. “Ramadan Mubarak” and “Ramadan Kareem” are common greetings exchanged in this period, wishing the recipient a blessed and generous month respectively.
Last year, fasting across the world ranged from 10 to 20 hours a day.
At the end of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr. In Arabic, it means “festival of breaking the fast”.
Depending on the new moon sighting, Eid al-Fitr this year is likely to fall on May 2.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/When-does-Ramadan-begin2022_2-04-1.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The United Nations, diplomats, and others have pushed for another potential ceasefire to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, similar to efforts for a truce over the past few years.

The GCC, a six-nation organisation including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, was to hold closed-door talks during the summit.
On Monday, the GCC’s Secretary-General Nayef al-Hajraf had a conversation with British ambassador to Yemen Richard Oppenheim and Yemeni officials allied with its internationally recognised but exiled government.
Those talks saw al-Hajraf, a Kuwaiti politician, discuss “efforts to stop the war and ways to achieve comprehensive peace to alleviate the human suffering witnessed by Yemeni people”, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.
The Houthi rebels, meanwhile, have rejected the summit because of its being held in Saudi Arabia, as well as the continuing closure of Sanaa’s airport and restrictions on the country’s ports by the Saudi-led coalition that is waging war on the Houthi rebels.
The rebels, who over the weekend attacked an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jeddah ahead of a Formula One race there, have called for the talks to be held in a “neutral” country.
In a speech broadcast on the rebels’ Al Masirah television network on Monday, Yemeni rebel leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi said the rebels “will spare no effort to confront the aggression and siege”, after the fighters declared a ceasefire two days earlier.
“You will regret missing out” on the ceasefire, he said, adding the coalition members would not be spared further strikes unless they “stop the aggression, lift the siege and end the occupation” of Yemen.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

Since 2016, the coalition has enforced an air and sea blockade of rebel-held territory in Yemen.

‘Time to talk in calm atmosphere’
Meanwhile, Houthi spokesman Mohammad Abdul-Salam wrote on Twitter: “The Saudi regime must prove its seriousness towards peace … by responding to a ceasefire, lifting the siege and expelling foreign forces from our country.
“Then peace will come and it is time to talk about political solutions in a calm atmosphere away from any military or humanitarian pressure.”
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke late Monday with Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. The State Department said the two “discussed support for the UN’s proposal for a Ramadan truce in Yemen and efforts to launch a new, more inclusive and comprehensive peace process”.
Yemen’s war began in September 2014, when the Houthi rebels swept into the capital, Sanaa, from their northwestern stronghold in the Arab world’s poorest country.
They then pushed into exile the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, elected in 2012 as the sole candidate after the long rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh.
A Saudi-led coalition, including the United Arab Emirates, entered the war in March 2015 to try and restore Hadi’s government to power. But the conflict stretched into long bloody years, pushing Yemen to the brink of famine. The United Nations describes it as the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the warfare, including many civilians.","/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-11T083820Z_441856443_RC27SQ907RQZ_RTRMADP_3_YEMEN-SECURITY.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

In its second report released on Tuesday, the Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya (FFM) said there were reasonable grounds to believe that international human rights and humanitarian law are being violated in several secret detention facilities in Libya.
Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Libya parliament approves new government as crisis escalateslist 2 of 3UN voices concern over vote on new Libyan prime ministerlist 3 of 3Libyan parliament swears in new PM as crisis deepensend of list“We have uncovered further evidence that the human rights violations experienced by detainees in Libya are widespread, systematic or both,” Mohamed Auajjar, the chair of the FFM, said in a statement.
The 18-page report is set to be presented to Geneva’s Human Rights Council on Wednesday.
Violations include intimidation and harassment of activists, attacks on the judiciary, and abuse towards vulnerable groups, including migrants and women.
The mission also stated that it is looking into witness accounts of “mass graves” in the desert city of Bani Walid.

The mayor of Bani Walid, Younis al-Azozi, acknowledged that there had been abuses of migrants in the past, but said the situation had improved in recent years.
“We deny what was stated in the report … No group or organisation has visited the city for a long time and we do not know from where this group got its information,” he said.
The UN report, the second of three based on some 120 interviews between October and March, flagged grave violations against migrant women occurring in the city where the mass grave is alleged to be.
“If migrants … heard the word Bani Walid, she or he would start crying. They set fire to and burn women’s breasts and vaginas there,” a female migrant told investigators.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.  Accurate.

It is unknown how many bodies might be buried in the graves. Chaloka Beyani, one of the mission’s three members, said a newly appointed forensic expert would investigate further.
The FFM also investigated a raid on the Gargaresh area of Tripoli in early October. The crackdown resulted in the arrest of more than 5,000 people and in the detention of several vulnerable individuals, including 215 children and more than 540 women, the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said.
Beyani said the situation for migrants in Libya was “very, very dire”, and called for technical assistance to help Libya hold the perpetrators accountable.
Democratic transition
Alongside widespread abuse towards migrants, the UN report also focused on violations affecting the country’s democratic transition, such as the intimidation of activists, and raised concerns about secret prisons allegedly run by rival armed militias.
The findings came as Libya experienced further political turmoil, after postponing democratic elections scheduled for December. This directed fact-finding efforts towards violations, abuses, and crimes that can especially hamper the transition to the rule of law and democratic elections, the report said.
The UN found that several worrying incidents in the run-up to the planned ballot have cast doubt on the fulfilment of the obligations of Libya’s de facto authorities to guarantee freedom of expression and assembly for its citizens, including the detention by armed groups of individuals from Sirte for expressing their political views.
The UN Human Rights Council established the FFM in June and mandated it to investigate alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law committed in Libya since 2016.
The FFM’s first report in October documented acts of murder, torture, imprisonment, rape, and enforced disappearance perpetrated in Libya’s prisons, which may amount to crimes against humanity.
It is scheduled to deliver a comprehensive report at the next session of the council in June.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2021-10-12T125755Z_9957347_RC2B8Q9FHMVH_RTRMADP_3_LIBYA-MIGRANTS.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

They are the victims of the now 11-year-long Syrian war who continue to wait at Jordan’s Azraq camp, their futures still uncertain and their livelihoods still dependent on donors’ generosity.

“Can you take us outside,” asked 11-year-old Asmaa Fawaz Barhu who came to Azraq camp when she was five.
“‘Since we have been here, we have not seen trees, we have not seen animals,’ my children say,” Asmaa’s mother, Zahra Ghareeb al-Daher, told Al Jazeera. “‘Are we going abroad, going to travel to Germany?’ they ask me.”
Zahra’s seven children, two of whom were born in the camp, have not left the premises since they arrived in 2016, she said.
Residents must present a work permit to leave, which only 30 percent of the camp’s working-age population holds, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Jordan spokeswoman, Lilly Carlisle. They are occasionally granted “leave permits”, which are valid for on average a week with repercussions for those who overstay.
Opened in 2014, the camp was designed to address the challenges that emerged during the informal growth of Zaatari camp, Jordan’s largest for Syrian refugees. However, the top-down system of management, high security, and remote location have left Azraq commonly referred to as the “least desirable” of Jordan’s two main camps for Syrian refugees.
It hosts “Village 5”, a secured area where nearly 10,000 Syrians are kept on the premises for “reasons of safety and national security”, noted Carlisle, the camp’s stringent security protocols largely attributable to the prison-like compound.
Azraq has never reached even half its maximum capacity of 120,000, the majority of refugees choosing to bear the high costs of living outside its perimeters.Sign up for Al JazeeraWeekly NewsletterThe latest news from around the world.Timely.

But for some, there is no alternative. “What are we going to do?” Zahra said. “Life is very hard out there. We won’t be able to afford it.”

Price of freedom
Nearly 80 percent of the 673,957 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan live in urban areas, where UNHCR’s breadth of services, notably housing and healthcare, are far less accessible – posing great challenges for a population whose work opportunities are extremely limited.
Syrians are limited to sectors open to non-Jordanians such as agriculture, sales, and construction, and must pay the non-insured Jordanian rate for all healthcare services, prices out of reach for most of the population, Carlisle said.
Ahlam Ibrahim and her husband, Riad Ahmed, left Azraq camp in 2019 when she was pregnant with her sixth child.
“We were not able to live there,” Ahlam told Al Jazeera, referencing the camp’s prison-like atmosphere.
They sell their monthly World Food Programme (WFP)-distributed food stamps to afford rent in their small apartment in Jabal Hussein refugee camp, a nearly 70-year-old camp for Palestinian refugees in the kingdom’s capital, Amman.
Riad explained how they receive about 150 Jordanian dinars ($212) monthly in food vouchers, which they can sell for about 130 dinars ($183) to traders in the Zaatari camp, who then buy products from its supermarket and resell them in the surrounding cities. This covers their 100 dinars ($141) monthly cost of rent, he told Al Jazeera.
Sometimes, in the months Riad finds work, they are able to save their food stamps. But during most of the year, Ahlam said, she relies on her neighbours’ help to feed her children.
Still, for Riad and Ahlam, the high costs of living outside the camp are worth it. They said their children are learning better in Jordan’s public schools, the food they can access is fresher, and their apartment is easier to heat than the camp’s tin caravan.
Syrian refugees living in urban areas such as Riad and Ahlam were hit especially hard by the pandemic-induced economic downturn, which forced thousands to decide their quality of life in Jordan was no longer sustainable.
In 2021, as unemployment rates in the kingdom rose to unprecedented levels, about 5,800 Syrian refugees in Jordan voluntarily returned to Syria, according to UNHCR figures.
Others chose to return or remain in the camps for more easily accessible UNHCR-provided services. “The standards of living in the camp are high,” said Carlisle. “We have seen more people staying in the camps because they don’t have to pay for rent, food, water, etc.”
Zahra said in the camp at least “I have a door and I have my family. It is safe.”

‘There is nothing’
In March 2011, pro-democracy demonstrations followed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s deadly crush of the dissent ignited a civil war, which, fuelled by proxy warfare, has raged in Syria now for 11 years.
“My house was completely destroyed, my clothes, my jewellery, everything is destroyed,” said Zahra. “I hope to return, but at the same time, what am I going to return to? There is nothing.”
The majority, 96 percent, of Syrian refugees do not see themselves returning to Syria in the next year, a UNHCR survey conducted in October 2021 found.
“It’s now been over a decade that Jordan has been hosting over 1.3 million Syrians,” Jordan’s Planning Minister Nasser Shraideh told Al Jazeera. “We’ve been sharing our resources, our public services, our infrastructure.”
“We hope for a political resolution for the Syrian issues, which would allow Syrians to return back to their homeland, but until then, the government of Jordan will do its best to accommodate them,” Shraideh added.
A public opinion survey released at the start of the year found growing fatigue in the Jordanian host community’s attitudes towards supporting refugees. About 39 percent of respondents said the government’s refugee response was “oversufficient” – a number more than triple that recorded in October 2020.
The survey also reported a growing consensus that “refugees get more help than Jordanians”. An overwhelming 81 percent of survey respondents said Jordanians have been affected more severely by the pandemic’s economic repercussions than refugees.
“Jordanians have been quite welcoming towards refugees,” Shraideh said. “I hope that the rising tensions from the economic hardships we are witnessing because of the pandemic’s repercussions will not jeopardise this.”

Donor fatigue
The protracted nature of the Syrian conflict coupled with competing global crises has contributed to increasing donor fatigue, Senior External Relations Officer at UNHCR Jordan Francesco Bert told Al Jazeera.
Bert noted while UNHCR has managed to sustain its level of services, its NGO partners are “struggling to keep up”. In September last year, the WFP alerted 110,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan that their food assistance would end in October.
“The first year we were here [at Azraq camp] there were more services,” Zahra said. She referred to items such as food packages her family would receive from smaller charities during their first years in the camp.
“We are nine people so when we only depend on the WFP vouchers, sometimes it can be a struggle. So the small charities used to help us,” she said.
Shraideh referred to the pressures a decade of hosting Syrian refugees have placed on Jordan’s resources and job opportunities. “The international community should raise the level of support for Syrian refugees in Jordan,” he said, in reference to the increasing levels of donor fatigue.
The humanitarian response to the Syrian crisis is “at the crossroads to transition to a different approach” as more development actors enter the fold “we need to look beyond an annual cycle”, Bert said.
“We are ultimately facing a challenge that every humanitarian organisation has to go through. At what point can you pass over your services to development actors? We cannot take Jordanian hospitality for granted when it comes to refugees,” he added, but, “we would like to see more sectors becoming open for refugees.”
Last year, Jordan issued a record 62,000 work permits to Syrians. In July 2021, the government, in cooperation with UNHCR, opened work permits for Syrians in all sectors open to non-Jordanians, which had previously been limited to agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.
Bert also noted while an “interesting entrepreneurship” has developed in the camps, the restrictions on movement have limited its ability to flourish. “We would like to see Syrians able to move more freely in and out of the camps and more opportunities for Syrians to be able to work in the surrounding community.”
However, Shraideh said, “It would be quite challenging for the economy to produce additional jobs that are much needed for Jordanians. We [the Jordanian government] need to address the rising challenges for Jordanians while trying to do our best for Syrians.”
But the “vast majority” of Syrian refugees will be in Jordan for years to come, Bert said.
“Years from now, the idea for us [UNHCR] is that refugees will not be singled out as per their legal status, but rather be included in the national programme,” he noted, adding the services could be made not just for the benefit of refugees but for both populations.
“I want my girls to have a better future,” Zahra said. “At least, God willing, they can finish their education and then they can follow their own dreams. But for my dreams, don’t ask me because my dreams are over. Now it’s their turn.”","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Azraq-Child-2.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

The investigation centers around money laundering and embezzling public funds in Lebanon between 2002 and 2021, Eurojust said. Five properties in Germany and France were seized as well as several bank accounts.
Salameh has already been under investigation in France, Switzerland and Lebanon, raising pressure on the once-celebrated veteran banker who’s been at the helm of the central bank, also known as Banque du Liban, since 1993. Swiss authorities are looking into allegations that he benefited from the sale of Lebanese Eurobonds held in the central bank’s portfolio, Bloomberg reported in early 2021.
Salameh has denied the allegations and has said they’re part of a media campaign to tarnish his image. His fortune was amassed during a previous career as a private banker at Merrill Lynch, he has said.
The central banker has been at the forefront of Lebanon’s worst financial crisis in decades as many partly blamed him for the economic collapse that wiped out people’s life-savings, triggered triple-digit inflation and plunged the middle class into poverty.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/lebanon.jpg?resize=770%2C513"

First detected in the early days of January, the sub-variant is even more transmissible than its highly contagious Omicron siblings, BA.1 and BA.1.1.
Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3COVID: What we know so far about the Omicron subvariant BA.2list 2 of 3Omicron ‘sub-variant’ throws up new virus questionslist 3 of 3Is the Omicron subvariant BA.2 more transmissable?end of listHere’s what we know about BA.2, often referred to as the “stealth variant”.
Why is it called the ‘stealth variant’?
That’s because BA.2 is slightly harder to track.
A missing gene in BA.1 allowed it to be tracked by default through a common PCR test. BA.2 and another sibling, BA.3 – also increasing in prevalence but currently at low levels – can only be found by genomic sequencing.
Even though BA.2 is more infectious than other Omicron sub-variants, according to studies, evidence suggests so far that it is not more likely to cause severe disease.
Are vaccines effective against BA.2?
As with the other Omicron variants, vaccines are less effective against BA.2 than they are against other variants like Alpha or the original strain of coronavirus, and protection declines over time.
However, according to UK Health Security Agency data, protection is restored by a booster jab, particularly for preventing hospitalisation and death.

Can you catch BA.2 if you already had BA.1?
A key concern about BA.2 was whether it could re-infect people who had already had BA.1, particularly as a number of countries seemed to be experiencing “double peaks” in infection rates surprisingly close together.
But data from the UK and Denmark shows that while Omicron can reinfect people who had other variants, such as Delta, only a handful of BA.2 reinfections in people who had BA.1 have been found so far among tens of thousands of cases.Sign up for Al JazeeraCoronavirus NewsletterMedical developments, troubling variants, the human impact—it’s all here.Sign upYour subscription failed.

Scientists say a possible explanation for the recent rise in BA.2 could be that many countries have lifted public health interventions.
“In some ways, it could just be that BA.2 was the variant that was circulating when all these people stopped wearing masks,” said Dr Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said it was “a little too early” to call whether the US too would see a significant BA.2 wave.
But whatever the reason for BA.2’s rise, scientists say it is a reminder that the virus continues to cause harm, particularly among unvaccinated, under-vaccinated and vulnerable populations.
“It is still a huge public health problem and it is going to continue to be,” said Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh.","/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP20076669751772.jpg?resize=770%2C513"
