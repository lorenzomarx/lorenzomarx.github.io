         Co-governance has been in the water in Parliament for the past month, in large part thanks to two events: Act's announcement it would like to hold a referendum on the principles of
         the Treaty of Waitangi, and, more recently, the death of Dr Moana Jackson, a public intellectual who has shaped how many in public life understand the Treaty.
        One group less keen to talk about co-governance is the Government.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern demurred when asked about co-governance proposals relating to Willie Jackson's forthcoming Cabinet paper on honouring the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People in her Monday press conference.""Co-governance — I feel like it's becoming an increasingly politicised term,"" Ardern said.But co-governance is firmly on the political agenda, in the form of Three Waters, RMA reform, UNDRIP, and the Māori Health Authority (which looks more like devolution than co-governance, but that distinction appears to have been lost).The issue is one on which Act and National are furthest apart. Act wants a referendum which would settle and codify the principles of the Treaty. This would, in practice, limit the Treaty's application to parts of public life and end the push to greater co-governance.Make a beeline for the BeehiveGet weekly politics headlines with commentary from our political experts straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

It is less keen on invoking the Treaty in the delivery of public services - a nod to its opposition to co-governance in the area of Three Waters.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Both allege the Government has been less than upfront in its co-governance ambitions.They're not wrong on the final point.Related articlesPoliticsLuxon rules out referendum, Seymour says don't 'run away'29 Mar, 2022 12:23 PMQuick ReadNew Zealand|PoliticsOpinion: Co-governance referendum is not the answer6 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadNew Zealand|PoliticsDavid Seymour: Why co-governance isn't our future5 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadBusinessSasha Borissenko: How Dr Moana Jackson changed Pākehā hearts and minds3 Apr, 2022 03:00 PMQuick ReadThe Government has lacked candour when it comes to explaining its broader ambitions for co-governance. Ministers tend to focus on why non-Māori have nothing to fear, rather than why a co-governance model is necessary.Three Waters reforms are the most egregious example of this.The contorted governance structures of the four new entities appear to have been designed for the sole purpose of enabling co-governance. Boards are three steps removed from the councils that officially own the entities (councils and mana whenua will appoint representatives, who will appoint a selection panel, who will appoint the board).When asked why mana whenua have what amounts to 50 per cent of a say over who is appointed to entity boards, Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta tends to say that this is because mana whenua take a long-term view when it comes to asset management, and that they will help manage the assets well.Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta wants to introduce co-governance to Three Waters. Photo / Mark MitchellThat's correct. There's decades (and, arguably, centuries) of evidence showing iwi manage assets well and in the long-term interest.But of course, there are many groups of people who are capable of managing assets well, not just Māori. Literally speaking, this argument only justifies not excluding Māori from Three Waters governance. It does not speak to why the entities are designed to create effective Māori co-governance.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The fact the Government, and Mahuta in particular, often don't give the real answer to the co-governance question, that it is to honour the Crown's commitments under the Treaty, suggests they are not confident they could win that argument. Politicians well know it is unwise to pick a fight you are not confident of winning.We seem to be at something of an inflection point in the terms of our relationship with the Treaty. This is perhaps down to politics slowly grappling with what the Treaty's place will be once the focus shifts from settling historic claims (the irony here is the power to inquire into contemporary breaches of the Treaty through the Waitangi Tribunal is actually older than the ability to look at historic cases). Moana Jackson himself once said treaties are not meant to be ""settled"", so much as they are ""honoured"".It is understandable this has confounded politics. Act's call for a referendum on what the principles of the Treaty actually mean in contemporary New Zealand makes sense in a certain light.The Treaty is a constitutional document, whose interpretation has evolved rapidly to no small amount of chagrin. It occupies an essential, but awkward place in our lives. This too is understandable. There aren't many documents that have gone from being ""a nullity"", in the words of one jurist, to constitutional in the space of a century.There is an argument to be made for going back to the electorate and seeking a mandate for a renewed and clarified definition of what such a document means.But that argument is undermined by two key details: first, that before the Treaty was recognised indisputably as part of our constitution, it was an agreement between two peoples - an agreement which would almost certainly be undermined were it to be put to a referendum; and second, because the agreement protects the interests of a minority against those of the majority - referendums pitting majority against majority are rightly frowned upon.Read MoreThree Waters reform: Frustrated mayor tells Jacinda ...Three waters reform: Working group frustrated by government ...Three Waters: Whangārei water no longer used by oil ...Phil Goff has dissented from a Government working group ...Three Waters: Decisions announced by Local Government ...Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta admits the ...Bryce Edwards: Political Roundup – Can Three Waters ...For those reasons, any attempt to use a democratic mechanism to curtail the minority interest of Māori would be likely to lead to significant and justified grievance, which is probably not worth whatever ephemeral gains there would be by stopping the politico-judicial evolution of the Treaty that's taken place over the past half century.But junking the referendum idea does little to answer how politics reckons with how the Treaty should be honoured now. Parliament's Environment Committee recently grappled with this while looking at the bill that will replace the Resource Management Act.Submitters want the Government to codify Treaty principles in relation to the new RMA in the legislation itself to give people greater clarity over how the Treaty pertains to resources. The committee, however, was concerned this would see the legislation become ""out of date"" as Treaty jurisprudence evolved.New Zealand is not the country it was two decades ago, when Treaty issues opened cultural fissures and defined the 2005 election campaign. Some polling suggests most voters don't actually understand the Three Waters reforms, and those who claim to, support them.But Labour does face a challenge over the next year rolling out expanded co-governance over Three Waters and resource management. That challenge is that the obligations in honouring the Treaty could diverge strongly from what it is able to find a democratic mandate to do.To continue reading this article and to support great journalismFor the first 16 weeks* pay just$ 5$1.99per weekSee offersFull access to the very best Herald content including business insights, in-depth analysis and investigative journalismExpand your world view with content from leading global publishersYour subscription includes subscriber-only features such as curated newsletters, Q and A sessions and article commentingAlready have an account?Sign inEligible newspaper subscribers, find outhow to activate your digital subscription233"

         It's as if Dr Ashley Bloomfield's entire life was on a trajectory to meet Covid-19 and help guide
         New Zealand through it.
        Fate is a fanciful notion but there he is, 1pm each day, offering a steady and sure message for a country in lockdown with a lifetime's worth of experience, skills and training geared towards the crisis we are now experiencing.It's been years since the Ministry of Health was led by a medical doctor. Years, too, since that doctor was someone who had trained and worked in the specialist discipline of public health.What's more, Bloomfield arrived at the ministry in June 2018 at a time when relationships across the public health system were strained. The 20 district health boards had been locked in an adversarial struggle with government and somehow the Ministry of Health had become the fulcrum on which Treasury would lever its budgetary demands.In the tumultuous world of health bureaucracy, the ministry's purpose had become muddled and the areas in which it was providing leadership - and the type of leadership it gave - seemed contrary to that those at the coalface of the health sector wanted.Just months after starting as Director-General of Health, that top level of health bureaucracy was redesigned. Bloomfield finished the work begun by his friend, interim director-general and experienced health sector manager, Stephen McKernan.Make a beeline for the BeehiveGet weekly politics headlines with commentary from our political experts straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

In press conferences on the outbreak, he was able to lean on his public health background with authority and talk with personal experience of the benefits of targeting those hesitant about vaccination.Bloomfield came to the Covid-19 crisis with the knowledge and time to prepare. He had the management team he wanted, organised how he wanted. He had a practice run. Through a lifetime of work, he had developed the skills needed.Related articlesNew Zealand|PoliticsAudrey Young: A spot of trouble in Ardern's virtual bubble11 Apr, 2020 05:00 AMQuick ReadNew ZealandPolice warn 5G protesters to abide by lockdown laws10 Apr, 2020 11:05 AMQuick ReadWorld'How do I get help?'

Everyone in New Zealand appreciates the work he and Ministry of Health officials are doing.""Two weeks into alert level 4 lockdown, there is a petition calling for him to be the 2021 New Zealander of the Year, fan Twitter accounts tweeting Bloomfield memes and fans who have dubbed themselves ""Bloomers"".

There is even a love song for Bloomfield on YouTube from young musician-composer Maxwell Apse that includes the lyric, ""the way he speaks makes me feel like it's gonna be okay"".Apse says the song came out of a family discussion about Bloomfield - who he calls a ""cultural phenomenon"" - weeks ago.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.""He knows what he's talking about, doesn't sugarcoat how it is and he has answers for questions. It's what we need.""Who is Ashley Bloomfield?So, where did he come from? Bloomfield, now 54, was one of three children born to Allan and Myreine Bloomfield. He has an older brother who is a law lecturer and a sister who is a nurse.Both parents have since died, most recently Allan Bloomfield in 2017. His mother had been a teacher and his father a Lieutenant-Colonel, who went on to run Mitsubishi Motors in Porirua until manufacturing gave way in the late-1990s.Those who worked for Allan Bloomfield remember him fondly as a gentleman with a sharp intelligence. One of those later worked for his son, too, and recognised traits that had created bonds of loyalty between Bloomfield snr and his staff. A number who knew Bloomfield snr remarked on how proud he would be now, if he could see his son.Damon Plimmer grew up with the Bloomfield children in Tawa, a slice of middle New Zealand from a time made distant by the huge changes of the 1980s. Plimmer, now an Anglican vicar, recalls it as a suburb that hosted many of Wellington's larger companies, with a prison at one end and a psychiatric hospital at the other.Covid-19 in NZ — 18th DecemberActive casesConfirmed & Probable51⬆︎8All active cases are imported2110⬆︎10Total cases0In Hospital0In ICU2034⬆︎2Recovered25Deaths427⬆︎10Border casesBloomfield was schooled out of the area - as was Plimmer - at Scots College, the independent Wellington school founded on Presbyterian values that still holds the Christian faith as the core of its values.Plimmer remembers Bloomfield finishing school as head prefect before leaving for medical school at the University of Auckland. In his time at school, he was shown to be academically, athletically and musically capable.Bloomfield started university a year ahead of Coleman, taking a year off after qualifying to travel and then returning to continue his studies in the same year as the future Health Minister. He met his wife Libby at university - she is also a doctor - and they married the  year he qualified.Libby Bloomfield, who met her husband Ashley at medical school in Auckland. Photo / SuppliedThere were periods after working in hospitals here and in the United Kingdom but - with being made a Master in Public Health in 1996 - his future medical path was set.Public health is a discipline that aims to improve health outcomes as broadly as possible across a population. Where a GP will focus on one patient at a time, a public health specialist will have a wider view, taking in communities and even entire societies and working to find ways of improving the health of as many as possible.Where a GP or clinical doctor might be focused entirely on medical solutions, a public health specialist will look more laterally to study the impact of factors such as poverty and housing.It's a health intervention that aims - to use current lingo - to get ahead of the curve. Bloomfield was working in this space for about 30 years when the greatest of challenges fetched up on his watch.In that time, he has built a career and a family and been involved and contributed to the community.During and after university there was hospital work as any fledgling doctor would do and a spell in United Kingdom hospitals before a return to New Zealand and shift back to Wellington about 1999.Bloomfield and wife Libby have raised three children in the time since. The three are either nearing the end of secondary school or studying at university.Home is Eastbourne, that secluded community on the other side of Wellington Harbour. They moved there about the time Bloomfield was settling into the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Health.He worked a few years for the National Screening Unit, which aims to provide screening for illnesses in a way that flattens the provision of care on the basis of need, rather than location. Bloomfield was identified as fiercely bright, passionate and hard-working - potential engaged through a State Service Commission-run leadership programme.NeedToKnow3About that time, he was made Chief Advisor Public Health in 2005, leading the country's Tobacco Control programme. He was, according to NZ Doctor, ""legendary"" for his work in the area. It was a role he held through to 2010, taking on greater responsibilities during that time.Plimmer - who is now in Wanaka - had lost contact with Bloomfield after school but connected again when the family moved to Eastbourne where he was vicar at the Anglican church, St Alban's.""There's an incredible congruity between what he thinks and how he lives his life. He's a person of incredible integrity, with regard for others, and humility,"" says Plimmer.""He was able to balance work life and home life so well for someone whose job makes such demands.""The Bloomfields' connection to the church was a path to faith but also to community. It's a link both Plimmer and former Presbyterian vicar Reuben Hardie recall. Bloomfield's days across the harbour at the ministry blended with community and family activities, roles with the local Butterfly Creek Theatre Troupe and youth programmes.Libby Bloomfield threw herself into roles that connected to the children and to the community. She began with their preschool and is now on the senior leadership team at Wellesley College with responsibility for chaplaincy and pastoral care. The family's faith connection continues through  St Alban's Church, where Libby Bloomfield is a member of the vestry.Bloomfield and Hardie would run in the mornings with their dogs - a labrador and a beagle. Plimmer occasionally joined the pair for the 30-minute trot to Pencarrow and back.Hardie likes to tell the story of his first marathon. He ran with Bloomfield, who had previously completed one. It was Rotorua, about 2004 and they were aiming for three hours. ""I hit a significant wall,"" he says, but his mate Bloomfield was fine.A shopper in Hastings determined to take all possible protections. Photo / Paul TaylorHe could have gone on but he slowed his pace and stuck with Hardie. Somewhat ruefully, Hardie recalls ""it took about four hours"" before they finished, as they had begun, together.""There's no hidden agenda with Ash,"" Hardie says. ""He's in that role for the right reasons. He's very easy going, gets on with everyone.""Plimmer watches the 1pm updates and sees the Bloomfield he recognises from Eastbourne, ""with a sense of humility and service"".Then he says: ""This isn't about him. It's about the wellbeing of this country.""I have a huge amount of confidence and trust in Ash. I can't think of a better person to be Director-General of Health at this time.""Path to the topBloomfield's role at the Ministry of Health took him to Geneva for a year in 2011 where he worked at the World Health Organisation. If you want to see what a functional, smooth bureaucracy looks like, he joked years later, go to the WHO, then come back to the Ministry of Health and you'll be a lot happier about what we've got here.When Bloomfield returned in 2012, he became an acting deputy director-general at the ministry before leaving for the coal-face of health as the senior executive managing population health across Hutt Valley, Capital and Coast and Wairarapa district health boards.He spent five years in district health boards, becoming chief executive of Hutt Valley District Health Board in 2015 and then being parachuted in as acting chief executive of Capital & Coast District Health Board in 2018.The experience at a health board is invaluable for those intending to work at a higher level of the central bureaucracy, says Stephen McKernan, who was Director-General of Health from 2006-2010 and a former chief executive of DHBs.

""It requires you to prioritise - to make difficult decisions.""It is understood at the Ministry of Health that such decisions are made. It pushes the mantra that the health dollar is not endless. But at a DHB, the reality of the decisions you make is often just an elevator ride away - or in the community you drive through on your way home.Hawke's Bay hospital emergency department preparing for Covid-19 cases. Photo / Paul Taylor""Real-life experience,"" is how Northland District Health Board chief executive Dr Nick Chamberlain describes it.And relationship management is difficult. Everyone is competing for money and services in their area, but not all will get what they want.McKernan was drafted in as acting director-general after the incumbent, Chai Chuah, resigned in December 2017. An accountant and technocrat, Chuah's time running the ministry came during the National government's strenuous efforts to repress health spending across DHBs. His exit came after bungles over allocation of cash to DHBs and just months after the Labour administration took over.The hunt for a new, permanent director-general was extensive. There were 27 candidates who applied. Of those short-listed, they faced an interview panel of four, and an hour on the end of a Kim Hill inquisition, with psychologists looking on.Ultimately, it was Bloomfield who took over. ""I thought he would be perfect,"" says Chamberlain. ""I encouraged him to take it and I'm sure others did as well.""Ashley was the perfect mix of having worked in the ministry, being a public health physician and having then worked in DHBs and done a good job there as well.""He also knew the machinery of government and how government works. So he went eyes open as well.""Chamberlain says the workload also requires a fine balance. ""You've got to understand the requirements of politicians. You have to balance political wills … you can't always do what you want to do from a public health perspective.""McKernan, having performed the role on two occasions, is well placed to describe the extraordinary workload which comes with it.Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 6:56Loaded: 0%Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently playing liveLIVERemaining Time -6:56 Playback Rate1xChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Tracken (Main), selectedFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

The director-general needs to be across new research, reports, 20 DHBs, the wider government's requirements and the narrowly focused needs of every sector.""It feels at times Wellington can just descend on you.""The Director-General of Health is many creatures. They are the chief executive of the Ministry of Health as an agency, which carries responsibility for the 1100 staff and the work they produce. The director-general is also the ultimate manager for the ""plethora of contracts with various providers"" for a vast range of health services. They manage and then account for a substantial part of a $16 billion health budget.There is the responsibility to provide good strategic guidance on policy to the government, while also monitoring and reporting on the performance of the system. Beyond all this, the director-general is the government's key adviser on health issues.Bloomfield, he says, has the ability to see all sides of the health system. ""He is able to understand the place of clinicians, NGOs and public health plays in the system.""Sophal Bun out with her sons (8) in their New Lynn, Auckland, street during the Covid-19 lockdown. Photo / Alex BurtonMcKernan describes Bloomfield - who he has known for about 20 years - as ""a fantastic operator. He's incredibly bright, articulate. He's a fantastic human being. A good team player with a fantastic sense of humour. He understands Wellington, the ministry as an agency and understands the sector.""And now, like others, he tunes in for the 1pm briefing. ""I look at Ashley in full admiration and think, 'Go for it mate.'""The 1pm briefingFor a nation trying to track the progress of the virus, there is comfort in the solid regularity to Bloomfield's 1pm appearances.It's not just the time slot, although this is a factor. On one occasion, the briefing was set at a different time, which prompted intense speculation and worry. Bloomfield's decision to take a day off a few weeks ago was initially startling to Bloomers.Those briefings were unfamiliar when they began in January. Few tuned in then but now, half the nation seems to have stopped for the Bloomfield Briefing, which delivers calm, informed and intelligent authority.""People are looking for strength and certainty,"" says Massey University professor David Johnston, an expert in disaster management. ""Part of that is strength in leadership and certainty of leadership.""A pensive Ashley Bloomfield arrives to deliver his 1pm briefing on Covid-19. Photo / Getty ImagesPeople seek out that certainty in uncertain times, he says. Such a person doesn't have to be perfect, he says. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, for example, had the characteristics needed to take the country through World War II with deep flaws that, at that point of crisis, had little impact.Where we are now is New Zealand in 1939, he says. This is wartime. It's a time for the right leadership, not the search for perfect leadership.Fifteen days on from the lockdown beginning, the public can also take confidence that New Zealand's leadership has made good decisions by looking to other countries. ""It's pretty clear the consequences of not doing things just by turning on the news. You're realising, 'We don't want that.'""People develop confidence in leadership when they can see it is delivering. ""The loss of life not happening - that's an easy sell to convince people the lock-in is a good thing.""Also, Johnston also makes the point that leadership is not just an individual. ""Leadership is a system as well. It's a ministry that's doing it - it's the team that's wrapped around it.""Just a few months after taking on the director general's job, Bloomfield told a University of Otago gathering in Wellington: ""Leadership is about ensuring direction and very clearly not giving direction. It's about generating energy and getting focus and commitment to deliver.""""Partnership,"" said Bloomfield. ""You can't do anything without others. Success is around bringing talent together, a lot of hard work and really high ambition. Ambition is a good thing. It's about seeing possibilities and not being prepared to take anything less than the possibilities you're anticipating.""With Covid-19, we have a possibility in New Zealand many other countries missed out on. From the top of one DHB - Chamberlain at Northland - to the emergency room of another, there is a satisfied confidence among those who know Bloomfield well that he will work to make the most of it.A former medical school classmate and now president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, Dr John Bonning, works as an emergency doctor at Waikato Hospital. This is the part of the health system bracing to catch the brunt of an outbreak.""[Bloomfield] is doing an absolutely phenomenal job from our perspective,"" says Bonning, speaking as college president.Bonning rang Bloomfield shortly after the pandemic was declared. ""We both thought, 'We're in for a bit of a ride here.'"" And yet, so far, it hasn't happened. It will, he believes. ""It's going to be busy and it's going to be tough and be worse than it is at the moment.""But not now, or at least, not yet.Until then, Bonning says Bloomfield's clarity and leadership is keeping us on the course we need. Running through attributes Bloomfield brings to this ""utterly career-defining"" moment, Bonning rattles through his friend's clarity of mind, ability to understand multiple different viewpoints and a mix of being world-wise and down-to-earth.And there's always public health, the job Bloomfield always wanted in medicine. If any doctor wanted to do the greatest good for the largest number of people, wrestling with a deadly pandemic would be right up there.Bonning laughs. ""Public health is not the sexiest of specialties. But, goodness me, it's come into its own now.""• Covid19.govt.nz: The Government's official Covid-19 advisory websiteCOVID-19 UPDATEcases55522 Jancases65423 Jancases94124 Jancases1,43425

         In February, the Serious
         Fraud Office (SFO) accused two former employees of Broadspectrum (New Zealand) Limited, previously Transfield, of receiving bribes in exchange for awarding road maintenance work to subcontractors between 2015 and 2018.
        One of the former employees, Aurelian Hossu, was charged with four counts of acceptance of gifts by agent. This week he pleaded guilty to all four charges while also abandoning any further bid for name suppression.Court documents show the 37-year-old Hossu was accused by SFO of jointly accepting more than $390,000 in bribes in exchange for continuing contracts.He is due to be sentenced later this year.Read MoreSFO charges six over alleged bribes for roadworks contracts ...Liquidator lays complaint with SFO over alleged actions ...Labour Party art auctions: Charged trio of businessmen ...Former East Wind manager facing SFO charges over alleged ...The other ex-Broadspectrum employee faces three charges of obtaining by deception and 12 charges of acceptance of gifts by agent.On Wednesday at a hearing in the Auckland District Court, he argued for continued interim name suppression alongside two of the four subcontractors allegedly awarded the work.Make it your business to knowStart your day with the latest business headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

An interim suppression order was then made for Bioletti's client and the subcontractors for at least 20 working days to allow the legal challenge to be made.Related articlesNew Zealand|PoliticsBribery: Corrupt former Auckland Council worker sentenced12 May, 2020 10:00 AMQuick ReadBusinessBusinessman who bribed public officials forfeits $3.5m, gets houses and vintage car back8 May, 2021 05:00 AMQuick ReadBusinessFormer ADHB employee accused of taking bribe for medical supplies22 Mar, 2022 01:16 PMQuick ReadBusinessBanker behind Ponzi scheme became painter behind bars25 Feb, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadJudge Glubb also indicated a future trial for the group would likely not be heard until the end of 2023.Court papers released to the Herald reveal further details and the extent of the alleged corrupt venture.The SFO's accusations against the second ex-Broadspectrum employee include accepting for himself and others more than $1.26 million in bribes.His deception charges relate to 205 allegedly false invoices submitted to Broadspectrum which saw three other companies obtain a total of $4.48m, including one firm collecting $3.77m in 2017.The case is due to return to court in June.In 2017, the head of roading contracting business Projenz Stephen Borlase was jailed in what was New Zealand's largest bribery prosecution.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.An investigation by the SFO found Borlase bought-off Auckland Transport and Rodney District Council officials, including Murray Noone and Barrie George, in exchange for contracts worth tens of millions of dollars between 2005 and 2013.Just last month, a former Auckland District Health Board employee and a company director were accused of bribery and corruption in the procurement and supply of medical equipment.And in 2020, former Auckland Council procurement relationship specialist Sundeep Dilip Rasila was sentenced to home detention after taking a $15,000 bribe and helping his long-time friend Sunil Chand secure a nearly $150,000 Chinese USB devices contract.Chand was sentenced to community detention.To continue reading this article and to support great journalismFor the first 16 weeks* pay just$ 5$1.99per weekSee offersFull access to the very best Herald content including business insights, in-depth analysis and investigative journalismExpand your world view with content from leading global publishersYour subscription includes subscriber-only features such as curated newsletters, Q and A sessions and article commentingAlready have an account?Sign inEligible newspaper subscribers, find outhow to activate your digital subscription6"

         The
         council is consulting on two options.
        Option one - the commissioners' preferred option - develops the area with a library, museum, civic whare and upgraded Baycourt, and costs around $300 million.Option two is a smaller project with the library, a community hub and the civic whare, and would cost around $126m.At the meeting, a resident asked why there was no option to disagree with both proposals.Commission chairwoman Anne Tolley responded: ""Anyone's free at any time to disagree... everyone has a view, and they're perfectly entitled to that"".Start your day in the knowGet the latest headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

[but to] try and give confidence to the other city developers to invest in your city... the whole landscape of it that provides multiple opportunities for people to gather, to be entertained.""Another resident was concerned the museum could be a ""white elephant"".""We don't really know what this museum involves... we don't need a gross or big museum.""Tolley responded: ""That's your opinion, sir, and I respect it... there are lots of other people who think we need to have that taonga out"".One resident said the design was ""ugly"" and she was ""not a bit interested in the civic redevelopment"".""I want to know what we are going to do to make this city better to live in.""Tolley said she understood the resident's concerns and ""the quality of life [in Tauranga] had suffered unnecessarily because growth hasn't been managed"".She said the commission was ""investing for the future at the same time as we're backfilling for the past"".Another resident was worried the civic precinct would become ""a privileged, gated community"" for only people who could afford to live near it and called it ""a $300m playground for apartment dwellers"".Commissioner Stephen Selwood said the council was working to improve housing affordability by providing more land and infrastructure.He said the planned rates increase of 13.7 per cent would allow the council to build the infrastructure to enable the city to ""grow up"" with more affordable apartments.Residents also raised concerns about the consultation process.One was worried young people who supported the museum might not have the chance to be heard.""You get us oldies coming out to tell you what we want... how do you propose getting the views of the young families and the hard-working people who haven't got time to be consulted?""He said he felt ""embarrassed by how little I know about this region"", and wanted his grandchildren to have more knowledge.Tolley said the council was using social media and email submissions and had been ""heartened"" to see a range of submissions from different ages so far.After the meeting, Tolley told the Bay of Plenty Times she thought it had gone ""really well, with some good questions asked and answered"".""Overall, the meeting was very respectful and was well-managed.""As with any meeting of this nature, there were a range of views expressed and that's entirely appropriate... it's important that everyone has a chance to speak their minds.''To continue reading this article and to support great journalismFor the first 16 weeks* pay just$ 5$1.99per weekSee offersFull access to the very best Herald content including business insights, in-depth analysis and investigative journalismExpand your world view with content from leading global publishersYour subscription includes subscriber-only features such as curated newsletters, Q and A sessions and article commentingAlready have an account?Sign inEligible newspaper subscribers, find outhow to activate your digital subscription5"

        Doak has turned his gut feeling into a quest to find out the identity of the portrait's subject.""I saw the signature on it.""Doak was sure the portrait, attributed in auction to ""the New Zealand School"", was indeed an original painting by renowned artist Charles F Goldie.Since then, Doak, who is based in Christchurch, has been on a mission to prove the painting's significance and reconnect the portrait's subject with his history.Start your day in the knowGet the latest headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

After studying art in Paris he returned to New Zealand, where he died in 1947.Goldie remains best known for his portraits of koroua and kuia. His first painting of this kind was of Rotorua's Mary Wharepapa in 1902.Doak believes the portrait he bought could be significant for the people of Te Arawa.His first clue was in the portrait's frame, where Doak found a label and an exhibition number.A signature in the corner of the painting and labels found on its frame could point to this being an original Goldie. Photo / Supplied""The label was from the frame-maker of Charles Goldie,"" Doak said.""The signature is consistent [with] Charles Goldie. The exhibition label [number 15] was for 1917 and the frame was an original of the era.""AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Doak's research discovered that Goldie had exhibited a painting entitled Lost in Thought, Ngaheke, an Arawa Chieftain in Christchurch in 1917. The portrait was number 15 in that exhibition.""How could it not be?"" Doak said.Doak brought the painting to retired curator and owner of Independent Art Valuations Ltd Neil Roberts.Roberts had been a curator at Robert McDougall Art Gallery and the Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetu for 27 years.""There were certainly areas of the painting which were clearly by Goldie's hand,"" Roberts said.""That's what convinced me that it was originally a Goldie.""Roberts said at first he'd had some reservations because the painting had undergone ""substantial cleaning and reconstruction"" in its lifetime.""But then, I looked at it closely.""Goldie had a quality of being able to lift the texture of the face out of the picture frame to a degree.""An exhibition catalogue from 1917, showing two portraits by Goldie were on display.

You get a sense for whether or not a work is genuine.""So you start with that and then you try to prove yourself wrong.""Roberts has given Doak a letter of authenticity saying to the best of his professional knowledge, the portrait is a work of the artist, Charles Frederick Goldie.Independent Art Valuations Ltd estimated the insurance value of Doak's painting at $455,000.The record sale price for a Goldie portrait at auction was set on Tuesday night when the portrait of Kamariera Te Hau Takiri Wharepapa sold for $1.8 million.The previous record was set by Hori Pokai - A Sturdy Stubborn Chief, which was hidden for 100 years before it sold for $1.7 million in November.The artist Charles F Goldie in his studio, digitally recreated.
