         Co-governance has been in the water in Parliament for the past month, in large part thanks to two events: Act's announcement it would like to hold a referendum on the principles of
         the Treaty of Waitangi, and, more recently, the death of Dr Moana Jackson, a public intellectual who has shaped how many in public life understand the Treaty.
        One group less keen to talk about co-governance is the Government.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern demurred when asked about co-governance proposals relating to Willie Jackson's forthcoming Cabinet paper on honouring the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People in her Monday press conference.""Co-governance — I feel like it's becoming an increasingly politicised term,"" Ardern said.But co-governance is firmly on the political agenda, in the form of Three Waters, RMA reform, UNDRIP, and the Māori Health Authority (which looks more like devolution than co-governance, but that distinction appears to have been lost).The issue is one on which Act and National are furthest apart. Act wants a referendum which would settle and codify the principles of the Treaty. This would, in practice, limit the Treaty's application to parts of public life and end the push to greater co-governance.Make a beeline for the BeehiveGet weekly politics headlines with commentary from our political experts straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

It is less keen on invoking the Treaty in the delivery of public services - a nod to its opposition to co-governance in the area of Three Waters.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Both allege the Government has been less than upfront in its co-governance ambitions.They're not wrong on the final point.Related articlesPoliticsLuxon rules out referendum, Seymour says don't 'run away'29 Mar, 2022 12:23 PMQuick ReadNew Zealand|PoliticsOpinion: Co-governance referendum is not the answer6 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadNew Zealand|PoliticsDavid Seymour: Why co-governance isn't our future5 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadBusinessSasha Borissenko: How Dr Moana Jackson changed Pākehā hearts and minds3 Apr, 2022 03:00 PMQuick ReadThe Government has lacked candour when it comes to explaining its broader ambitions for co-governance. Ministers tend to focus on why non-Māori have nothing to fear, rather than why a co-governance model is necessary.Three Waters reforms are the most egregious example of this.The contorted governance structures of the four new entities appear to have been designed for the sole purpose of enabling co-governance. Boards are three steps removed from the councils that officially own the entities (councils and mana whenua will appoint representatives, who will appoint a selection panel, who will appoint the board).When asked why mana whenua have what amounts to 50 per cent of a say over who is appointed to entity boards, Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta tends to say that this is because mana whenua take a long-term view when it comes to asset management, and that they will help manage the assets well.Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta wants to introduce co-governance to Three Waters. Photo / Mark MitchellThat's correct. There's decades (and, arguably, centuries) of evidence showing iwi manage assets well and in the long-term interest.But of course, there are many groups of people who are capable of managing assets well, not just Māori. Literally speaking, this argument only justifies not excluding Māori from Three Waters governance. It does not speak to why the entities are designed to create effective Māori co-governance.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The fact the Government, and Mahuta in particular, often don't give the real answer to the co-governance question, that it is to honour the Crown's commitments under the Treaty, suggests they are not confident they could win that argument. Politicians well know it is unwise to pick a fight you are not confident of winning.We seem to be at something of an inflection point in the terms of our relationship with the Treaty. This is perhaps down to politics slowly grappling with what the Treaty's place will be once the focus shifts from settling historic claims (the irony here is the power to inquire into contemporary breaches of the Treaty through the Waitangi Tribunal is actually older than the ability to look at historic cases). Moana Jackson himself once said treaties are not meant to be ""settled"", so much as they are ""honoured"".It is understandable this has confounded politics. Act's call for a referendum on what the principles of the Treaty actually mean in contemporary New Zealand makes sense in a certain light.The Treaty is a constitutional document, whose interpretation has evolved rapidly to no small amount of chagrin. It occupies an essential, but awkward place in our lives. This too is understandable. There aren't many documents that have gone from being ""a nullity"", in the words of one jurist, to constitutional in the space of a century.There is an argument to be made for going back to the electorate and seeking a mandate for a renewed and clarified definition of what such a document means.But that argument is undermined by two key details: first, that before the Treaty was recognised indisputably as part of our constitution, it was an agreement between two peoples - an agreement which would almost certainly be undermined were it to be put to a referendum; and second, because the agreement protects the interests of a minority against those of the majority - referendums pitting majority against majority are rightly frowned upon.Read MoreThree Waters reform: Frustrated mayor tells Jacinda ...Three waters reform: Working group frustrated by government ...Three Waters: Whangārei water no longer used by oil ...Phil Goff has dissented from a Government working group ...Three Waters: Decisions announced by Local Government ...Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta admits the ...Bryce Edwards: Political Roundup – Can Three Waters ...For those reasons, any attempt to use a democratic mechanism to curtail the minority interest of Māori would be likely to lead to significant and justified grievance, which is probably not worth whatever ephemeral gains there would be by stopping the politico-judicial evolution of the Treaty that's taken place over the past half century.But junking the referendum idea does little to answer how politics reckons with how the Treaty should be honoured now. Parliament's Environment Committee recently grappled with this while looking at the bill that will replace the Resource Management Act.Submitters want the Government to codify Treaty principles in relation to the new RMA in the legislation itself to give people greater clarity over how the Treaty pertains to resources. The committee, however, was concerned this would see the legislation become ""out of date"" as Treaty jurisprudence evolved.New Zealand is not the country it was two decades ago, when Treaty issues opened cultural fissures and defined the 2005 election campaign. Some polling suggests most voters don't actually understand the Three Waters reforms, and those who claim to, support them.But Labour does face a challenge over the next year rolling out expanded co-governance over Three Waters and resource management. That challenge is that the obligations in honouring the Treaty could diverge strongly from what it is able to find a democratic mandate to do.To continue reading this article and to support great journalismFor the first 16 weeks* pay just$ 5$1.99per weekSee offersFull access to the very best Herald content including business insights, in-depth analysis and investigative journalismExpand your world view with content from leading global publishersYour subscription includes subscriber-only features such as curated newsletters, Q and A sessions and article commentingAlready have an account?Sign inEligible newspaper subscribers, find outhow to activate your digital subscription233"

He inherited a basket case of a Health Ministry that had innumerable moving parts - which often didn't talk to each other - and a mentality that it knew best and didn't need to consult anyone else.The Covid results speak for themselves.New Zealand kept the virus mostly at bay while most of the rest of the world burned, and when it couldn't be kept at bay any longer, the population was already highly vaccinated and dealing with a less deadly variant.Make a beeline for the BeehiveGet weekly politics headlines with commentary from our political experts straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

Photo / Getty ImagesBloomfield has had to front failures - though he has always refused to use that term - in many areas where the Beehive made demands and the ministry fell short.There was the testing debacle in 2020 when Cabinet declared that all  border-facing workers would be regularly tested, but nearly two months later most of them still hadn't been.There was the loose application of the rules when two sisters were allowed to leave MIQ before being tested, and then later tested positive. It then took the ministry a week to find out how many other people - more than 50 - had been allowed to leave MIQ without a test.And there was the glacially slow pace to adopt saliva testing, build and stress-test contact-tracing capacity, order rapid antigen tests, share information with Māori health providers so they could do their job as well as possible, and even have a post-elimination plan at all.Questions were asked about whether Bloomfield, a clinician who specialised in public health medicine and an all-around nice guy, had the managerial chops to bust heads when he needed to.But those questions were never asked by the public.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The level of adoration for Bloomfield was never more on display than at a conference for GPs in Wellington last August, where Health Minister Andrew Little introduced the latest update for the health system overhaul and was dragged across the coals during questions from the floor.Many of those questions could also have been directed at Bloomfield, who followed Little's presentation. But when the mics hit the floor for the director general, there was nothing but praise for saving lives - and even a request for a selfie.His level of national celebrity even became somewhat politicised, when the Opposition raised questions about why the Prime Minister needed Bloomfield at her side for every media conference, even the ones where alert level decisions weren't being announced.The subtext was that Jacinda Ardern was taking advantage of any shine that may have been rubbing off from the glorified public servant beside her.It isn't hard to see why Bloomfield wants to cut short his term.Read MoreDirector general of health Ashley Bloomfield resigns ...Dr Ashley Bloomfield steps down: All his greatest TV ...Ministry of Health under fire: Minister doesn't want ...Having potentially thousands of lives hanging on your decisions would weigh heavily on anyone.He has also spoken of the anxiety and self-doubt during the earlier stages of the pandemic, and in facing near-daily press conferences.""I had many mornings, especially early on in the pandemic, when I'd get up and think, 'Gosh, can I really do this? I wish this wasn't happening,'"" he said during one Q&A session.An open question is whether the overhaul of the health system contributed to his decision, though Bloomfield has only said that it's a good time to leave, given the ministry's changing role.That role will be an oversight position, focused on strategy, policy, and monitoring health outcomes across the country.Running the health system will fall to Health NZ, while the Māori Health Authority will try to ensure the new system reduces health inequities for Māori.Dr Ashley Bloomfield will leave his position as director general of health in July. Photo / Mark MitchellBeing at the forefront of this kind of reshuffling of an already complex system doesn't appeal to many.""It's going to get messy. The dynamic between the ministry, Health NZ and the Māori Health Authority is 'strained'. Major power games,"" one health insider told me.No one will begrudge Bloomfield his decision to leave early.But given the trust and reverence he has built up over the past two years, there's probably no one better placed to shepherd in the health reforms than him.To continue reading this article and to support great journalismFor the first 16 weeks* pay just$ 5$1.99per weekSee offersFull access to the very best Herald content including business insights, in-depth analysis and investigative journalismExpand your world view with content from leading global publishersYour subscription includes subscriber-only features such as curated newsletters, Q and A sessions and article commentingAlready have an account?Sign inEligible newspaper subscribers, find outhow to activate your digital subscription"

         ultimately the country has more pressing national issues.
        Mind you, if you look at the current field of contenders for Auckland mayor, Mitchell would bolt home, which is why I assume Wayne Brown tipped his hat in.Mitchell last week in the House made mincemeat of Police Minister Poto Williams over gangs.We all know gangs are out of control in this country, the gang numbers have ballooned, the violence has skyrocketed, and for every story of a Lamborghini or Harley that's impounded with the latest record bust, there is any number of shootings, stabbings, beatings, robberies and general violent mayhem that goes unchecked.Mitchell asked whether gang violence had increased or decreased under this Government, and the minister, foolishly, said she rejected the question's premise.Make a beeline for the BeehiveGet weekly politics headlines with commentary from our political experts straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

Photo / Mark Mitchell It is essentially a defence mechanism to try and dig yourself out of the indefensible or the blatantly obvious.It's like their other current trick, blaming the previous government.The irony of course is the last government is actually them, what they mean of course is the last government that wasn't them, but given that government was well over four years ago, the excuse is tired and lazy, but also covers them off momentarily from dealing with their growing list of failures.Eventually, Mitchell asked what part of the premise was the minister rejecting in his question, it was at this point poor old Williams walked into her own trap.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The part, she said, where gang violence has increased under this Government, at which point the House melted down in laughter.Which raises the point, how long can a Government go simply denying things no matter how real they are?It took them an age to accept that KiwiBuild was a bust.Their current housing policy of ""tilting the market towards the first-home buyer"" is in tatters.Last week's Canstar survey has record numbers of first-home buyers tapping out, most alarmingly in their 30s and 40s, and that's before you got to last week's Trade Me rental figures which are at record levels of increase.The PM at the start of 2020 said house prices were out of control and she would fix them, are we at a point where she can admit she hasn't fixed them? Indeed, she has made them substantially worse ... or does she reject the premise of the question?Gang numbers alone tell you how bad things are, the gun crimes tell you how bad things are.The violent crime statistics are glaring, a lot of crime has actually dropped, but not violent crime.The latest stats show the number of victims of violent crime is up year after year, and yet the number of cases from those crimes that head to court falls.Which in part explains last week's numbers around the cost of prisons and the cost of prisoners ... the cost is up despite the number of people behind bars being down.Kelvin Davis said that is the cost of doing things differently, what he is doing differently is not putting people in jail, and when they are not in jail they are on the street beating people, shooting people, and adding to the social misery.Read MoreKāinga Ora resident's Tenancy Tribunal complaint after ...Kāinga Ora announces new measures to crack down on ...Developers, Act, National leaders on Kāinga Ora trouble ...Kāinga Ora chief executive under fire over emails at ...Kāinga Ora unruly tenants: Minister Poto Williams steps ...Man fed up with antisocial Kāinga Ora neighbours, sells ...Not all of it is gangs, but a lot of it is ... and Poto Williams refuses to accept it.Surely they must know away from the glare of Mark Mitchell's questions, of the growing series of headlines, that gangs and violence are political death.When people feel afraid, when downtowns are no-go zones when police aren't there to be seen when Kāinga Ora evicts no one despite the threats to blow you up or burn your house down when you curtail your lifestyle because of fear, and perhaps worst of all when your Government fails to accept any of it is true, just how long can you go rejecting the premise of the question before you are rejecting it from the opposition benches?To continue reading this article and to support great journalismFor the first 16 weeks* pay just$ 5$1.99per weekSee offersFull access to the very best Herald content including business insights, in-depth analysis and investigative journalismExpand your world view with content from leading global publishersYour subscription includes subscriber-only features such as curated newsletters, Q and A sessions and article commentingAlready have an account?Sign inEligible newspaper subscribers, find outhow to activate your digital subscription165"

         It's as if Dr Ashley Bloomfield's entire life was on a trajectory to meet Covid-19 and help guide
         New Zealand through it.
        Fate is a fanciful notion but there he is, 1pm each day, offering a steady and sure message for a country in lockdown with a lifetime's worth of experience, skills and training geared towards the crisis we are now experiencing.It's been years since the Ministry of Health was led by a medical doctor. Years, too, since that doctor was someone who had trained and worked in the specialist discipline of public health.What's more, Bloomfield arrived at the ministry in June 2018 at a time when relationships across the public health system were strained. The 20 district health boards had been locked in an adversarial struggle with government and somehow the Ministry of Health had become the fulcrum on which Treasury would lever its budgetary demands.In the tumultuous world of health bureaucracy, the ministry's purpose had become muddled and the areas in which it was providing leadership - and the type of leadership it gave - seemed contrary to that those at the coalface of the health sector wanted.Just months after starting as Director-General of Health, that top level of health bureaucracy was redesigned.

There is even a love song for Bloomfield on YouTube from young musician-composer Maxwell Apse that includes the lyric, ""the way he speaks makes me feel like it's gonna be okay"".Apse says the song came out of a family discussion about Bloomfield - who he calls a ""cultural phenomenon"" - weeks ago.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.""He knows what he's talking about, doesn't sugarcoat how it is and he has answers for questions. It's what we need.""Who is Ashley Bloomfield?So, where did he come from? Bloomfield, now 54, was one of three children born to Allan and Myreine Bloomfield. He has an older brother who is a law lecturer and a sister who is a nurse.Both parents have since died, most recently Allan Bloomfield in 2017. His mother had been a teacher and his father a Lieutenant-Colonel, who went on to run Mitsubishi Motors in Porirua until manufacturing gave way in the late-1990s.Those who worked for Allan Bloomfield remember him fondly as a gentleman with a sharp intelligence. One of those later worked for his son, too, and recognised traits that had created bonds of loyalty between Bloomfield snr and his staff. A number who knew Bloomfield snr remarked on how proud he would be now, if he could see his son.Damon Plimmer grew up with the Bloomfield children in Tawa, a slice of middle New Zealand from a time made distant by the huge changes of the 1980s. Plimmer, now an Anglican vicar, recalls it as a suburb that hosted many of Wellington's larger companies, with a prison at one end and a psychiatric hospital at the other.Covid-19 in NZ — 18th DecemberActive casesConfirmed & Probable51⬆︎8All active cases are imported2110⬆︎10Total cases0In Hospital0In ICU2034⬆︎2Recovered25Deaths427⬆︎10Border casesBloomfield was schooled out of the area - as was Plimmer - at Scots College, the independent Wellington school founded on Presbyterian values that still holds the Christian faith as the core of its values.Plimmer remembers Bloomfield finishing school as head prefect before leaving for medical school at the University of Auckland. In his time at school, he was shown to be academically, athletically and musically capable.Bloomfield started university a year ahead of Coleman, taking a year off after qualifying to travel and then returning to continue his studies in the same year as the future Health Minister. He met his wife Libby at university - she is also a doctor - and they married the  year he qualified.Libby Bloomfield, who met her husband Ashley at medical school in Auckland. Photo / SuppliedThere were periods after working in hospitals here and in the United Kingdom but - with being made a Master in Public Health in 1996 - his future medical path was set.Public health is a discipline that aims to improve health outcomes as broadly as possible across a population. Where a GP will focus on one patient at a time, a public health specialist will have a wider view, taking in communities and even entire societies and working to find ways of improving the health of as many as possible.Where a GP or clinical doctor might be focused entirely on medical solutions, a public health specialist will look more laterally to study the impact of factors such as poverty and housing.It's a health intervention that aims - to use current lingo - to get ahead of the curve. Bloomfield was working in this space for about 30 years when the greatest of challenges fetched up on his watch.In that time, he has built a career and a family and been involved and contributed to the community.During and after university there was hospital work as any fledgling doctor would do and a spell in United Kingdom hospitals before a return to New Zealand and shift back to Wellington about 1999.Bloomfield and wife Libby have raised three children in the time since. The three are either nearing the end of secondary school or studying at university.Home is Eastbourne, that secluded community on the other side of Wellington Harbour. They moved there about the time Bloomfield was settling into the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Health.He worked a few years for the National Screening Unit, which aims to provide screening for illnesses in a way that flattens the provision of care on the basis of need, rather than location. Bloomfield was identified as fiercely bright, passionate and hard-working - potential engaged through a State Service Commission-run leadership programme.NeedToKnow3About that time, he was made Chief Advisor Public Health in 2005, leading the country's Tobacco Control programme. He was, according to NZ Doctor, ""legendary"" for his work in the area. It was a role he held through to 2010, taking on greater responsibilities during that time.Plimmer - who is now in Wanaka - had lost contact with Bloomfield after school but connected again when the family moved to Eastbourne where he was vicar at the Anglican church, St Alban's.""There's an incredible congruity between what he thinks and how he lives his life. He's a person of incredible integrity, with regard for others, and humility,"" says Plimmer.""He was able to balance work life and home life so well for someone whose job makes such demands.""The Bloomfields' connection to the church was a path to faith but also to community. It's a link both Plimmer and former Presbyterian vicar Reuben Hardie recall. Bloomfield's days across the harbour at the ministry blended with community and family activities, roles with the local Butterfly Creek Theatre Troupe and youth programmes.Libby Bloomfield threw herself into roles that connected to the children and to the community. She began with their preschool and is now on the senior leadership team at Wellesley College with responsibility for chaplaincy and pastoral care. The family's faith connection continues through  St Alban's Church, where Libby Bloomfield is a member of the vestry.Bloomfield and Hardie would run in the mornings with their dogs - a labrador and a beagle. Plimmer occasionally joined the pair for the 30-minute trot to Pencarrow and back.Hardie likes to tell the story of his first marathon. He ran with Bloomfield, who had previously completed one. It was Rotorua, about 2004 and they were aiming for three hours. ""I hit a significant wall,"" he says, but his mate Bloomfield was fine.A shopper in Hastings determined to take all possible protections. Photo / Paul TaylorHe could have gone on but he slowed his pace and stuck with Hardie. Somewhat ruefully, Hardie recalls ""it took about four hours"" before they finished, as they had begun, together.""There's no hidden agenda with Ash,"" Hardie says. ""He's in that role for the right reasons. He's very easy going, gets on with everyone.""Plimmer watches the 1pm updates and sees the Bloomfield he recognises from Eastbourne, ""with a sense of humility and service"".Then he says: ""This isn't about him. It's about the wellbeing of this country.""I have a huge amount of confidence and trust in Ash. I can't think of a better person to be Director-General of Health at this time.""Path to the topBloomfield's role at the Ministry of Health took him to Geneva for a year in 2011 where he worked at the World Health Organisation. If you want to see what a functional, smooth bureaucracy looks like, he joked years later, go to the WHO, then come back to the Ministry of Health and you'll be a lot happier about what we've got here.When Bloomfield returned in 2012, he became an acting deputy director-general at the ministry before leaving for the coal-face of health as the senior executive managing population health across Hutt Valley, Capital and Coast and Wairarapa district health boards.He spent five years in district health boards, becoming chief executive of Hutt Valley District Health Board in 2015 and then being parachuted in as acting chief executive of Capital & Coast District Health Board in 2018.The experience at a health board is invaluable for those intending to work at a higher level of the central bureaucracy, says Stephen McKernan, who was Director-General of Health from 2006-2010 and a former chief executive of DHBs.

""It requires you to prioritise - to make difficult decisions.""It is understood at the Ministry of Health that such decisions are made. It pushes the mantra that the health dollar is not endless. But at a DHB, the reality of the decisions you make is often just an elevator ride away - or in the community you drive through on your way home.Hawke's Bay hospital emergency department preparing for Covid-19 cases. Photo / Paul Taylor""Real-life experience,"" is how Northland District Health Board chief executive Dr Nick Chamberlain describes it.And relationship management is difficult. Everyone is competing for money and services in their area, but not all will get what they want.McKernan was drafted in as acting director-general after the incumbent, Chai Chuah, resigned in December 2017. An accountant and technocrat, Chuah's time running the ministry came during the National government's strenuous efforts to repress health spending across DHBs. His exit came after bungles over allocation of cash to DHBs and just months after the Labour administration took over.The hunt for a new, permanent director-general was extensive. There were 27 candidates who applied. Of those short-listed, they faced an interview panel of four, and an hour on the end of a Kim Hill inquisition, with psychologists looking on.Ultimately, it was Bloomfield who took over. ""I thought he would be perfect,"" says Chamberlain. ""I encouraged him to take it and I'm sure others did as well.""Ashley was the perfect mix of having worked in the ministry, being a public health physician and having then worked in DHBs and done a good job there as well.""He also knew the machinery of government and how government works. So he went eyes open as well.""Chamberlain says the workload also requires a fine balance. ""You've got to understand the requirements of politicians. You have to balance political wills … you can't always do what you want to do from a public health perspective.""McKernan, having performed the role on two occasions, is well placed to describe the extraordinary workload which comes with it.Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 6:56Loaded: 0%Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently playing liveLIVERemaining Time -6:56 Playback Rate1xChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Tracken (Main), selectedFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

On a normal day, you can get a pile of reading that's 12 inches thick.""And there's people waiting outside your office wanting to kick ideas around, to get sign off, for scheduled meetings. The director-general needs to be across new research, reports, 20 DHBs, the wider government's requirements and the narrowly focused needs of every sector.""It feels at times Wellington can just descend on you.""The Director-General of Health is many creatures. They are the chief executive of the Ministry of Health as an agency, which carries responsibility for the 1100 staff and the work they produce. The director-general is also the ultimate manager for the ""plethora of contracts with various providers"" for a vast range of health services. They manage and then account for a substantial part of a $16 billion health budget.There is the responsibility to provide good strategic guidance on policy to the government, while also monitoring and reporting on the performance of the system. Beyond all this, the director-general is the government's key adviser on health issues.Bloomfield, he says, has the ability to see all sides of the health system. ""He is able to understand the place of clinicians, NGOs and public health plays in the system.""Sophal Bun out with her sons (8) in their New Lynn, Auckland, street during the Covid-19 lockdown. Photo / Alex BurtonMcKernan describes Bloomfield - who he has known for about 20 years - as ""a fantastic operator. He's incredibly bright, articulate. He's a fantastic human being. A good team player with a fantastic sense of humour. He understands Wellington, the ministry as an agency and understands the sector.""And now, like others, he tunes in for the 1pm briefing. ""I look at Ashley in full admiration and think, 'Go for it mate.'""The 1pm briefingFor a nation trying to track the progress of the virus, there is comfort in the solid regularity to Bloomfield's 1pm appearances.It's not just the time slot, although this is a factor. On one occasion, the briefing was set at a different time, which prompted intense speculation and worry. Bloomfield's decision to take a day off a few weeks ago was initially startling to Bloomers.Those briefings were unfamiliar when they began in January. Few tuned in then but now, half the nation seems to have stopped for the Bloomfield Briefing, which delivers calm, informed and intelligent authority.""People are looking for strength and certainty,"" says Massey University professor David Johnston, an expert in disaster management. ""Part of that is strength in leadership and certainty of leadership.""A pensive Ashley Bloomfield arrives to deliver his 1pm briefing on Covid-19. Photo / Getty ImagesPeople seek out that certainty in uncertain times, he says. Such a person doesn't have to be perfect, he says. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, for example, had the characteristics needed to take the country through World War II with deep flaws that, at that point of crisis, had little impact.Where we are now is New Zealand in 1939, he says. This is wartime. It's a time for the right leadership, not the search for perfect leadership.Fifteen days on from the lockdown beginning, the public can also take confidence that New Zealand's leadership has made good decisions by looking to other countries. ""It's pretty clear the consequences of not doing things just by turning on the news. You're realising, 'We don't want that.'""People develop confidence in leadership when they can see it is delivering. ""The loss of life not happening - that's an easy sell to convince people the lock-in is a good thing.""Also, Johnston also makes the point that leadership is not just an individual. ""Leadership is a system as well. It's a ministry that's doing it - it's the team that's wrapped around it.""Just a few months after taking on the director general's job, Bloomfield told a University of Otago gathering in Wellington: ""Leadership is about ensuring direction and very clearly not giving direction. It's about generating energy and getting focus and commitment to deliver.""""Partnership,"" said Bloomfield. ""You can't do anything without others. Success is around bringing talent together, a lot of hard work and really high ambition. Ambition is a good thing. It's about seeing possibilities and not being prepared to take anything less than the possibilities you're anticipating.""With Covid-19, we have a possibility in New Zealand many other countries missed out on. From the top of one DHB - Chamberlain at Northland - to the emergency room of another, there is a satisfied confidence among those who know Bloomfield well that he will work to make the most of it.A former medical school classmate and now president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, Dr John Bonning, works as an emergency doctor at Waikato Hospital. This is the part of the health system bracing to catch the brunt of an outbreak.""[Bloomfield] is doing an absolutely phenomenal job from our perspective,"" says Bonning, speaking as college president.Bonning rang Bloomfield shortly after the pandemic was declared. ""We both thought, 'We're in for a bit of a ride here.'"" And yet, so far, it hasn't happened. It will, he believes. ""It's going to be busy and it's going to be tough and be worse than it is at the moment.""But not now, or at least, not yet.Until then, Bonning says Bloomfield's clarity and leadership is keeping us on the course we need. Running through attributes Bloomfield brings to this ""utterly career-defining"" moment, Bonning rattles through his friend's clarity of mind, ability to understand multiple different viewpoints and a mix of being world-wise and down-to-earth.And there's always public health, the job Bloomfield always wanted in medicine. If any doctor wanted to do the greatest good for the largest number of people, wrestling with a deadly pandemic would be right up there.Bonning laughs. ""Public health is not the sexiest of specialties. But, goodness me, it's come into its own now.""• Covid19.govt.nz: The Government's official Covid-19 advisory websiteCOVID-19 UPDATEcases55522 Jancases65423 Jancases94124 Jancases1,43425
