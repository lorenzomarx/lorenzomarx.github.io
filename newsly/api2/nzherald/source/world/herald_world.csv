Those who suffer most are the civilians caught in the middle. Two recent deaths in Kharkiv, Ukraine, are a testament to that.
         A loaf of bread on a
         park bench, collecting snow. A puddle of blood nearby.
        Those were the traces of two lives lost this past week, two people killed as they sat sharing a late lunch or an early dinner, or maybe just feeding pigeons. No one seemed to know their names.They died at around 5:30 in the afternoon Sunday in the southeastern Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv, from a mortar strike, residents said, describing the victims as an older woman and a middle-aged man.It was overcast and cold, and the ambulance came quickly.""I was in the kitchen, putting the kettle on,"" said Tetiana Stepanenko, 55, who lives in the apartment building that overlooks the park. ""Suddenly, the windows shuddered. Then we heard the screams.""She looked out the window from the fourth floor; the bodies were motionless.Keep up to date with the day's biggest storiesSign up to our daily curated newsletter for the day's top stories straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

Civilians — unable to flee or refusing to do so — get caught between the fighting; ordinary, mundane moments suddenly and brutally become their last.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.In Ukraine, in such a short period of time, the litany of horrors on unsuspecting civilians has been especially pronounced after Russia invaded in February, including not least the victims found bound and murdered in Bucha, a suburb near Kyiv.Russians have not so far occupied Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, so there have not been the kinds of execution-style killings that have turned up in the towns near Kyiv. Instead, the violence arrives suddenly and unexpectedly. Kharkiv, which had a prewar population of around 1.4 million, has been shelled incessantly since Russia invaded. Government buildings have been hit with cruise missiles. Cluster bombs have saturated streets. Some residential areas have been turned into post-apocalyptic wastelands.Related articlesWorldSome Ukrainian refugees are returning home, despite the risks6 Apr, 2022 01:14 PMQuick ReadWorld'Sitting at home and trembling': A town emerges after a Russian retreat5 Apr, 2022 06:00 PMQuick ReadWorldIn a Kyiv suburb, 'they shot everyone they saw'4 Apr, 2022 02:02 PMQuick ReadWorld'This is true barbarity': Life and death under Russian occupation4 Apr, 2022 09:21 AMQuick ReadA Kharkiv resident preparing to leave her apartment after her neighbourhood was subjected to continued bombing.

The three mortar shells landed within 45 metres of one another, killing the two on the park bench and making a string of craters in the shape of an L.The scene, tucked into a network of Soviet-style apartments and mostly closed kiosks, quickly became a neighbourhood monument to the war's randomness, drawing people who had heard the murmurings of neighbours and the explosions there the day before.Mothers pointed out the scarred earth to their children. Young couples visited, looking around and pointing before darting off. Others walked by and shrugged.The pit made by a shell that landed on the sidewalk is the first indicator to passersby that something unusual happened here.The shallow hole is a few inches wide and carved into the cement like a splash. Gashes point in the direction the shell propelled the shrapnel within. There is even some of the lethal metal still in the ground, most of it the size of fish food but sharp enough to cut fingers.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Much of the war's casualties are caused by these kinds of indiscriminate shell strikes. Both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries have fielded an enormous amount of artillery that are fired at each other incessantly. There are rocket launchers capable of saturating an area the size of a football field with explosives. There are howitzers with shells so big they sound like cars driving overhead before screeching to the earth.In parts of Kharkiv, shattered buildings moan in the wind, their curtains sucked through broken windows like loose sails. Photo / Tyler Hicks, The New York TimesOne Ukrainian town in the country's south has lost people not just to shrapnel wounds but to heart attacks caused by the shelling.In Kharkiv, emergency medical workers move from neighbourhood to neighbourhood every day, pulling artillery fragments from places like grocery stores and apartment buildings. On Wednesday morning, seven emergency workers struggled to remove what looked like an expended Grad rocket that had lodged in a children's amusement park, tying the metal to a maintenance truck in an attempt to dislodge it. In the distance, church bells were soon replaced with air raid alarms.Near the sidewalk crater by the park in Slobidskyi, there is a damaged candy kiosk. That shell hit where the wall of the kiosk meets the ground. The metal is splayed open, its yellow paint shorn to steel.The more residents looked, the more they saw: three sedans with popped tires and cracked windows; a shredded sapling; and the results of a third shell that landed in the soft dirt of an adjacent playground, sending shrapnel through a child's swing and a green slide. The seesaw was seemingly untouched.The families with children in the neighbourhood have mostly fled since the war began, leaving the playground unoccupied.Emergency workers removing debris in Kharkiv. Photo / Tyler Hicks, The New York TimesStepanenko, the neighbour, a friendly and talkative woman, said that she had run to the window and looked down at the lifeless people next to the playground after the explosions.She and her fellow residents were too afraid to go outside, she said, so they watched from the windows until the ambulance arrived.""I asked, 'Who is that? What is that?' And I was told, 'They're from the sixth floor,'"" Stepanenko said. ""There was one Sasha on that floor; I don't see him around anymore. Maybe that was him. And the woman, I don't know.""Residents from the apartment complex were wary about talking to journalists, many worried that information made public could help the enemy. The idea that Russians could seize Kharkiv remains a real fear for many still living in the city. One man on the sixth floor said that he did not know anything before quickly shutting the door.One of Stepanenko's neighbours, Vasily, appeared startled when he was approached, convinced that anyone inquiring about the deaths could be pro-Russian agents.Visible from Stepanenko's vantage point were the signs of the deadly strike: the bread on the park bench and the puddle of blood.A snow-dusted loaf of bread remained on the park bench. In the background, sand from the playground's sandbox had been shovelled onto the pooled blood. Photo / Tyler Hicks, The New York TimesFor a few hours, before the pigeons ate some of the loaf and until a pile of sand scooped from the playground's sandbox had absorbed the blood, there was a brief echo of two people's existences that ended on an April day in 2022.Their deaths and their anonymous faces will ultimately become a statistic in this war — a number that will only increase.""They were sitting on the bench before,"" Stepanenko said. ""They are dead now.""This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

         As long as there has been marine life,
         there has been marine snow — a ceaseless drizzle of death and waste sinking from the surface into the depths of the sea.
        The snow begins as motes, which aggregate into dense, flocculent flakes that gradually sink and drift past the mouths (and mouthlike apparatuses) of scavengers farther down. But even marine snow that is devoured will most likely be snowfall once more; a squid's guts are just a rest stop on this long passage to the deep.Although the term may suggest wintry whites, marine snow is mostly brownish or greyish, comprising mostly dead things. For eons, the debris has contained the same things — flecks from plant and animal carcasses, faeces, mucus, dust, microbes, viruses — and transported the ocean's carbon to be stored on the seafloor. Increasingly, however, marine snowfall is being infiltrated by microplastics: fibres and fragments of polyamide, polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate. And this fauxfall appears to be altering our planet's ancient cooling process.Every year, tens of millions of tons of plastic enter Earth's oceans. Scientists initially assumed that the material was destined to float in garbage patches and gyres, but surface surveys have accounted for only about 1 per cent of the ocean's estimated plastic. A recent model found that 99.8 per cent of plastic that entered the ocean since 1950 had sunk below the first few hundred feet of the ocean. Scientists have found 10,000 times more microplastics on the seafloor than in contaminated surface waters.Marine snow, one of the primary pathways connecting the surface and the deep, appears to be helping the plastics sink. And scientists have only begun to untangle how these materials interfere with deep-sea food webs and the ocean's natural carbon cycles.""It's not just that marine snow transports plastics or aggregates with plastic,"" said Luisa Galgani, a researcher at Florida Atlantic University. ""It's that they can help each other get to the deep ocean.""Keep up to date with the day's biggest storiesSign up to our daily curated newsletter for the day's top stories straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

As these microbes metabolise, some produce polysaccharides that can form a sticky gel that attracts the lifeless bodies of tiny organisms, small shreds of larger carcasses, shells from foraminifera and pteropods, sand and microplastics, which stick together to form larger flakes. ""They are the glue that keeps together all the components of marine snow,"" Galgani said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Marine snowflakes fall at different rates. Smaller ones have a more languid descent — ""as slow as a meter a day,"" said Anela Choy, a biological oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.Bigger particles, such as dense faecal pellets, can sink quicker. ""It just skyrockets to the bottom of the ocean,"" said Tracy Mincer, a researcher at Florida Atlantic University.Related articlesLifestyleAlarming study about microplastics25 Mar, 2022 05:37 PMQuick ReadWorldTurtles dying from eating trash show plastics scourge in UAE8 Feb, 2022 07:23 PMQuick ReadWorldWho is behind the global surge in single-use plastic?19 May, 2021 07:00 PMQuick ReadWorldSea creatures deformed by plastic pollution, study says1 Dec, 2020 11:59 AMQuick ReadPlastic in the ocean is constantly being degraded; even something as big and buoyant as a milk jug will eventually shed and splinter into microplastics. These plastics develop biofilms of distinct microbial communities — the ""plastisphere,"" said Linda Amaral-Zettler, a scientist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, who coined the term.""We sort of think about plastic as being inert,"" Amaral-Zettler said. ""Once it enters the environment, it's rapidly colonised by microbes.""Plastic waste washing up on a beach in Bali, Indonesia. Surface surveys have accounted for only about 1 per cent of the ocean's estimated plastic. Photo / Getty ImagesMicroplastics can host so many microbial hitchhikers that they counteract the natural buoyancy of the plastic, causing their raft to sink. But if the biofilms then degrade on the way down, the plastic could float back up, potentially leading to a yo-yoing purgatory of microplastics in the water column. Marine snow is anything but stable; as flakes free-fall into the abyss, they are constantly congealing and falling apart, rent by waves or predators.""It's not as simple as: Everything's falling all the time,"" said Adam Porter, a marine ecologist at the University of Exeter in England. ""It's a black box in the middle of the ocean, because we can't stay down there long enough to work out what's going on.""To explore how marine snow and plastics are distributed in the water column, Mincer has begun to sample deeper waters with a dishwashersize pump full of filters that dangles on a wire from a research boat. The filters are arranged from big mesh to small to filter out fish and plankton. Running these pumps for 10 hours at a stretch has revealed nylon fibres and other microplastics distributed throughout the water column below the South Atlantic subtropical gyre.But even with a research boat and its expensive and unwieldy equipment, an individual piece of marine snow is not easily retrieved from deep water in the actual ocean. The pumps often disturb the snow and scatter faecal pellets. And the flakes alone offer little insight into how fast some snows are sinking, which is vital to understanding how long the plastics linger, yo-yo or sink in the water column before settling on the seafloor.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.""Is it decades?"" Mincer asked. ""Is it hundreds of years? Then we can understand what we're in here for, and what kind of problem this really is.""Instant marine snowTo answer these questions, and work within a budget, some scientists have made and manipulated their own marine snow in the lab.In Exeter, Porter collected buckets of seawater from a nearby estuary and loaded the water into continuously rolling bottles. He then sprinkled in microplastics, including polyethylene beads and polypropylene fibres. The constant churning, and a squirt of sticky hyaluronic acid, encouraged particles to collide and stick together into snow.""We obviously don't have 300 metres of a tube to make it sink,"" Porter said. ""By rolling it, what you're doing is you're creating a never-ending water column for the particles to fall through.""After the bottles rolled for three days, he pipetted out the snow and analysed the number of microplastics in each flake. His team found that every type of microplastic they tested aggregated into marine snow, and that microplastics such as polypropylene and polyethylene — normally too buoyant to sink on their own — readily sank once incorporated into marine snow. And all the marine snow contaminated with microplastics sank significantly faster than the natural marine snow.Experimental ""mesocosms"" created to mimic and observe marine snow. Photo / Luisa Galgani, Chiara Esposito, Paraskevi Pitta via The New York TimesPorter suggested that this potential change of the speed of the snow could have vast implications for how the ocean captures and stores carbon: Faster snowfalls could store more microplastics in the deep ocean, whereas slower snowfalls could make the plastic-laden particles more available to predators, potentially starving food webs deeper down. ""The plastics are a diet pill for these animals,"" said Karin Kvale, a carbon cycle scientist at GNS Science in New Zealand.In experiments in Crete, with funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research program, Galgani has tried mimicking marine snow on a larger scale. She dropped six mesocosms — huge bags that each contained nearly 800 gallons of seawater and re-created natural water movement — in a large pool. Under these conditions, marine snow formed. ""In the field, you mostly make observations,"" Galgani said. ""You have so little space and a limited system. In the mesocosm, you are manipulating a natural system.""Galgani mixed microplastics into three mesocosms in an attempt to ""re-create a sea and maybe a future ocean where you can have a high concentration of plastic,"" she said. The mesocosms laden with microplastics produced not just more marine snow but also more organic carbon, as the plastics offered more surfaces for microbes to colonise. All this could seed the deep ocean with even more carbon and alter the ocean's biological pump, which helps regulate the climate.""Of course, it's a very, very big picture,"" Galgani said. ""But we have some signals that it can have an effect. Of course, it depends on how much plastic there is.""A plastic feastTo understand how microplastics might travel through deep-sea food webs, some scientists have turned to creatures for clues.Every 24 hours, many species of marine organism embark on a synchronised migration up and down in the water column. ""They do the equivalent of a marathon every day and night,"" Choy said.Guilherme V.B. Ferreira, a researcher at the Rural Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil, wondered: ""Is it possible they are transporting the plastics up and down?""Ferreira and Anne Justino, a doctoral student at the same university, collected vampire squids and midwater squids from a patch of the tropical Atlantic. They found a plethora of plastics in both species: mostly fibres, but also fragments and beads.This made sense for midwater squids, which migrate toward the surface at night to feed on fish and copepods that eat microplastics directly. But vampire squids, which live in deeper waters with fewer microplastics, had even higher levels of plastic, as well as foam, in their stomachs. The researchers hypothesise that the vampire squids' primary diet of marine snow, especially meatier faecal pellets, may be funnelling plastics into their bellies.""It's very concerning,"" Justino said. Ferreira said, ""They are one of the most vulnerable species for this anthropogenic influence.""Justino has excavated fibres and beads from the digestive tracts of lanternfish, hatchetfish and other fish that migrate up and down in the mesopelagic, 198 metres to 1,000 metres down. Some microbial communities that settle on microplastics can bioluminesce, drawing in fish like a lure, said Mincer.Tubes of marine snow in the lab of Adam Porter at the University of Exeter. ""It's not as simple as: Everything's falling all the time,"" Dr. Porter said. Photo / Adam Porter via The New York TimesIn the Monterey Bay Canyon, Choy wanted to understand if certain species of filter feeders were ingesting microplastics and transporting them into food webs in deeper water. ""Marine snow is one of the major things that connects food webs across the ocean,"" she said.Choy zeroed in on the giant larvacean Bathochordaeus stygius. The larvacean resembles a tiny tadpole and lives inside a palatial bubble of mucus that can reach up to 1 meter long. ""It's worse than the grossest booger you've ever seen,"" Choy said. When their snot-houses become clogged from feeding, the larvaceans move out and the heavy bubbles sink. Choy found that these palaces of mucus are crowded with microplastics, which are funnelled to the deep along with all their carbon.Giant larvaceans are found across the world's oceans, but Choy emphasised that her work was focused on the Monterey Bay Canyon, which belongs to a network of marine protected areas and is not representative of other, more polluted seas. ""It's one deep bay on one coast of one country,"" Choy said. ""Scale up and think about how vast the ocean is, especially the deep water.""Individual flakes of marine snow are small, but they add up. A model created by Kvale estimated that in 2010, the world's oceans produced 340 quadrillion aggregates of marine snow, which could transport as many as 463,000 tons of microplastics to the seafloor each year.Scientists are still exploring exactly how this plastic snow is sinking, but they do know for sure, Porter said, that ""everything eventually sinks in the ocean."" Vampire squids will live and die and eventually become marine snow. But the microplastics that pass through them will remain, eventually settling on the seafloor in a stratigraphic layer that will mark our time on the planet long after humans are gone.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

It is widely promulgated and believed. Why?
         Some of the narratives are strikingly implausible: Ukraine is part of Russia. Most Ukrainians
         would welcome Russian rule but are misled by criminal and Nazis leaders who, with Nato backing, are planning an attack on Russia. The Ukrainian army shot down the Malaysian airliner, not the Russian-backed separatists, and blamed Russia. The Russian shelling of the nuclear power station was really a stage-managed explosion by the Ukrainian military to bias the Western media against Russia.

Some historical perspective may be useful.The Rus tribe used deception to survive, outwit, and finally defeat rival tribes, and then Mongol rule in the 12th and 13th centuries. Successive Tzarist regimes used deception wedded to military force successively to outmanoeuvre the then-dominant Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish kingdoms, the Ottoman Empire, and the Chinese Empire, and to extend Moscow's rule from the Baltic and Black seas to the Pacific Ocean.Keep up to date with the day's biggest storiesSign up to our daily curated newsletter for the day's top stories straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

They form elements in what is now called ""hybrid warfare"" which embraces not only propaganda but also espionage, infiltration, co-optation, subversion, sabotage, and assassination.Instruments of Russian propaganda span a spectrum from overt official outlets such as RT television, Radio Sputnik, RM Broadcasting, and ANNA News to covert ""troll farms"" that saturate social media channels with deliberate disinformation. The former broadcast in multiple languages using native speakers to add to their local credibility. The latter generate a torrent of false messages masquerading as news and balanced opinion.Related articlesNew ZealandKathy Spencer: Pharmac review - what to look for5 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadNew Zealand|PoliticsDavid Seymour: Why co-governance isn't our future5 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadNew ZealandTim Beveridge: Quit whinging over America's Cup for crying out loud4 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadNew Zealand|CrimeHelen White: We need to restore law and order to our city centre1 Apr, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadDissemination depends not only on Russian-generated fake accounts and blogs but especially on non-Russian intermediary media and witting or unwitting agencies, NGOs, or bloggers that voluntarily forward the Russian narratives to local audiences.Even high-ranking Chinese leaders are repeating the baseless claim that the US is sponsoring chemical and biological weapons factories in Ukraine.Stephen Hoadley. Photo / SuppliedThe credibility of even the most extreme messages – that Ukraine is a Nazi-led Nato proxy about to attack Russia with chemical and biological weapons, for example, or that the Mariupol maternity hospital destroyed by Russian shells was a military headquarters – is enhanced by volume, frequency, repetition, apparent variety of sources, and multiplication by proxies or algorithms.Also, Russian agencies are unhampered by any commitment to truth, accuracy, or consistency, so can be first in the media or cyberspace with a simplified pro-Russian version of a complex new issue, gaining the ""first impression"" advantage over more conscientious but slower Western agencies, media, and fact-checkers.Who believes Russian propaganda and why? Less-informed and marginalised groups and individuals, and some political leaders.This includes New Zealand anti-vaxxers, according to The Disinformation Project.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.It is easily consumed as a simplification of complex truths or a convenience to facilitate relations with Russia, as China appears to be doing.Groups and individuals everywhere who blame their governing institutions for their misfortunes are especially susceptible to the Western decadence-decline-and-aggression trope emphasised by Russian overt and covert media.Anti-West and opposition political leaders find Russian disinformation useful, as did the US Republican Party leaders, who used it to discredit Hilary Clinton in the 2016 election and to support Donald Trump in 2020.Older Russians who remember the horrors of Nazi invasion, and who depend on state media, tend to support Putin's portrayal of the ""military operation"" in Ukraine. Putin's popularity has risen despite sanctions and protests.A Flourish data visualizationMedia specialists concur that confronting ""hot"" emotionally-anchored disinformation with ""cool"" official factual rebuttals is ineffective, at least in the short run. A 2018 RAND Corporation report urged Western governments to step up the frequency, appeal, and especially promptness of messaging and to tailor it to identifiable audiences.Rallying the majority to governments' policies with appealing, credible, and sustainable information will be more legitimate and efficient than suppressing Russian propaganda channels or trying to shout down the distorted pro-Russian perceptions of anti-establishment minorities.Western leaders must communicate better to counterbalance Russia's tendentious narratives.• Stephen Hoadley is Associate Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Auckland.To continue reading this article and to support great journalismFor the first 16 weeks* pay just$ 5$1.99per weekSee offersFull access to the very best Herald content including business insights, in-depth analysis and investigative journalismExpand your world view with content from leading global publishersYour subscription includes subscriber-only features such as curated newsletters, Q and A sessions and article commentingAlready have an account?Sign inEligible newspaper subscribers, find outhow to activate your digital subscription"

Last year a man linked to the gilets jaunes slapped him on the face as he mingled with citizens in a town in southeastern France.The figure once described by the press as ""Jupiter"", king of the gods, who had won victory in May 2017 under the banner of a centrist movement he had founded only the year before, has crashed from Olympus.He no doubt regrets having told an unemployed gardener he met on a walkabout in 2018 that all he had to do was ""cross the street"" and he would easily find a job in catering or construction.Campaigning in 2017 for the presidency, he infuriated people with quips about ""slackers"", people who are ""nothing"" and their ""unreformable country"". It helped to promote the image of him as scornful and aloof.A barricade burns on the Champs Elysees in central Paris during a Yellow Vests demonstration on March 16, 2019. Photo / APYet for all the fury — and barring an extraordinary upset — this art-loving former Rothschild banker and finance minister is expected to rise once more, becoming the first president in 20 years to win a second term in office in the final-round vote on April 24.For this he can thank the failings of his rivals. For all her efforts to detoxify her far-right National Rally party, Marine Le Pen, running in second place, is still deemed a threat to democracy by a majority of the country, according to polls.A more plausible challenger, Valérie Pécresse, a conservative former education minister under Sarkozy, has disappointed supporters with a lacklustre launch and lack of charisma, and has failed to gain much momentum.Neither have the other, noisier campaigners, from Éric Zemmour, the ""French Trump"", a television pundit and anti-immigrant zealot, to the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a Nato-hating former supporter of Vladimir Putin who sounds nostalgic for the revolution and wants to ""sweep away"" the elite.Change in France has long been accompanied by lynch mobs and bloodshed — fear of the mob is encoded in the DNA of French presidents.As the Sunday Times Paris correspondent from 2001 to 2016, I covered three of them: the Gaullist Jacques Chirac, known for his fondness for sumo wrestling; Sarkozy, mocked for his love of ""bling""; and the scooter-riding socialist François ""I hate the rich"" Hollande.They fascinated — and occasionally shocked — the nation with their tangled sex lives and financial affairs.At Pernaut's funeral, for example, Sarkozy was thought to be wearing an electronic bracelet on his ankle after being sentenced last September to a year's detention at home over an illegal campaign funding scandal, one of several to haunt him in office.He and his predecessors were reviled for having the temerity to attack France's almost religious commitment to short working weeks and early retirement, and ended up backing down.The uproar over Macron's attempts at reform is further proof of how chronically allergic France is to change. It also demonstrates the limits of its presidential system, effectively an elected monarchy crafted six decades ago for the Fifth Republic and Charles de Gaulle.""It's difficult to be president,"" explains Jean Garrigues, a leading historian on France's political culture. ""The president has more power than virtually any other executive position in the world, even more than an American president.""By contrast the Assemblée Nationale, France's parliament, is an empty shell.French nationalist Marine Le Pen speaks during the show France in the Face of War in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, on March 14, 2022. Photo / APNo recent French leader has embraced these powers with quite the same gusto as Macron. He has revelled in welcoming foreign heads of state to the Palace of Versailles, delighting, like most of his predecessors, in strutting the world stage.But he has also exercised his presidential right to decide more rarefied matters that might otherwise have been left to panels of experts, from how to rebuild the fire-ravaged Notre Dame cathedral to who should lead the Paris Opera.""The president is responsible for everything, so he ends up personally being blamed for everything,"" says Gaspard Koenig, a philosopher who is campaigning for a more participatory democracy. ""It's an impossible task for any human being.""François Mitterrand, the former socialist leader whose nickname was ""God"", is remembered for ""great works"" such as the Louvre's giant glass pyramid. Macron, too, has a passion for playing the Sun King. Nowhere is this more obvious than in his modifications at the Panthéon, a monument to French glory and the resting place for national heroes such as Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Victor Hugo.When I visit one evening, celestial voices emanate from speakers hidden high in the cavernous expanse. Guests have gathered beneath the extraordinary dome for the first public performance of an unusual work by Pascal Dusapin, regarded in the music world as one of the greatest living composers.Macron personally commissioned choral pieces by Dusapin — as well as paintings and sculptures by Anselm Kiefer, the war-obsessed German artist, another favourite at court. The works were ordered to accompany the ""Panthéonisation"" in 2020 of Maurice Genevoix, an author who fought in the First World War and wrote of its horrors in The Men of 14.It was the first time in nearly a century that a French president had ordered the creation of new works for this national monument. So thrilled was Macron by Dusapin's piece that he commissioned a second, longer choral work, which is now echoing all around us.""I wanted to make the stones sing,"" says Dusapin, 66, a towering figure with an impressive mane, as we stroll beneath the 80m-high dome.Nearby are two vast canvases by Kiefer evoking no man's land as well as a series of his installations hinting at the trenches, with coils of tangled barbed wire and rusting metal enclosed in giant glass cases.Segments of Dusapin's original work, interspersed with the names of thousands of dead soldiers read by his wife, Florence Darel, a well-known actress, will now play every 15 minutes during public opening hours at the fabled secular temple on the Left Bank. A computer programme ensures that no sequence of notes in this eternal loop is ever repeated, according to Dusapin.Emmanuel Macron greets supporters in Paris on April 2, 2022. Photo / APMacron was involved every step of the way. ""I spent a lot of time discussing it with him,"" Dusapin says, referring to meetings with the president, sometimes over a fine malt whisky in the Élysée Palace or under the Panthéon dome.The president, an accomplished pianist who once won a prize at the Amiens conservatoire, was in the habit of dropping in on the work site to sample the astonishing acoustics for himself. ""From architecture to music and literature, he is really very cultivated,"" Dusapin says. ""He has a real respect for the value and power of art.""One evening last year the grateful president invited Dusapin, Darel and the Kiefers to dinner with him and Brigitte at home in the palace. After champagne and turbot, Macron poured them vodka from a bottle nestling, along with half a dozen shot glasses, inside an outsized Fabergé egg, a gift from Putin in happier days before the war.Dusapin and Darel approve of Macron's efforts to talk sense into the Russian president in more than a dozen marathon telephone conversations since his invasion of Ukraine. ""Can you imagine any of the other presidential candidates talking to Putin with such confidence or authority?"" asks Darel, 54.From the beginning of his reign the ambitious French leader had pivoted to Putin, inviting him to Versailles, eager to strengthen European ties with Russia to secure its co-operation in the dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions and other global flashpoints.""Pushing Russia away from Europe is a profound strategic error, because we will push it either into an isolation that increases tensions or into alliances with other great powers such as China,"" he told a gathering of ambassadors in Paris in August 2019.Acting now as Putin's chief European interlocutor, he takes inspiration from Sarkozy, who played the same role when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. ""Someone has to keep the channels open to Putin and our president can do that,"" says a French diplomatic source. ""In fact he may be the only one who can.""Even if Macron's diplomacy failed, it has done him no harm. On the contrary, the war has put pro-Putin populists on the defensive.Last month Le Pen had to destroy a million campaign leaflets depicting her shaking the Russian leader's hand. Zemmour, 63, did himself no favours on a campaign stop by describing Ukraine as a ""distraction"" from the more important ""threat from the south"", a reference to African immigrants.Not realising the cameras were still running, he was heard exclaiming ""Putain!"" — which translates into various English profanities — when Sarah Knafo, 28, his campaign adviser, who is pregnant with his child, explained that he urgently needed to take back his remark.Éric Zemmour, the ""French Trump"". Photo / APMacron, by contrast, has been able to use all the levers of office to cast himself on a plane above the vulgar mêlée of those out to dethrone him.""He believes in strong leadership — strong leaders are good in Macron's book,"" says Vincent Martigny, a professor of political science at the University of Nice.""And to be strong on the international stage, you have to show signs of strength,"" he adds, citing Macron's extraordinary handshake with Donald Trump, when he beat the American president at his own power game by refusing to let go of his hand for 29 seconds.""He resisted the handshake of Trump,"" Martigny says. ""He wanted to do the same thing with Putin, to show he's the strong guy in the West against him.""He goes on: ""Macron will be re-elected even though people don't like him. He's young, bright, quick and clever — qualities the French appreciate. He has tackled huge crises and is still there, he's survived. Many people will respect that. They'll be saying, 'Who else?' ""Even so, Macron remains something of an enigma. Some commentators have likened him to the 1970s television cartoon character Barbapapa, a shape-shifting pink blob who takes his name from the French word for candyfloss.""He has absolutely no ideological vertebrae,"" Martigny adds. ""If he needs to go to the right, he'll go to the right, if he needs to go to the left, he'll go to the left. He thinks one thing and the opposite very easily.""In the hope of learning more about the polymath president, I turn to Françoise Noguès, 71, a former doctor who is one of the guests at Dusapin's sonorous show.A male bodyguard shoots me a suspicious glance as I approach the mother of the president, a figure in a dark coat clutching a black purse, but she offers a friendly smile. She must be impressed with the boy, I suggest, for scaling such lofty heights.She nods, smiling, but then explains how nerve-racking it has been to see her son so reviled and threatened by the yellow vests. She holds up a hand with a laugh: ""Look, I've lost my nails. I can't bear to put on the news any more.""She is upset by a Macron biography that claimed her son does not talk to her and was mainly brought up by his grandmother. ""It's just not true,"" she tells me, adding that they speak and message each other often.As for her relationship with the première dame, who fell in love with her son, 24 years her junior, while teaching him drama at school, she says: ""Brigitte and I are good friends."" Then adds with another laugh: ""We're almost the same age.""That is not the only curiosity about life chez les Macron. Two of Macron's stepchildren, Laurence, a cardiologist, and Sébastien, an engineer, are older than him. His father, Jean-Michel, a professor of neurology, has remarried after separating from Noguès, and Macron has a stepbrother aged 15.There is nothing France appreciates more than a love story — and Macron's infatuation with Brigitte Trogneux, as she was known when he met her, aged 15, at the Jesuit school he went to in Amiens, is like none other.Brigitte was married at the time to André-Louis Auzière, a banker, and already a mother of three. The future president was in the same class as Laurence Auzière, one of Brigitte's two daughters, and would spend long hours around at her house nearby. ""I thought he was in love with Laurence,"" says Noguès, who now lives in Paris.The Macrons with Emmanuel's stepchildren, Tiphaine, 38 (left), Laurence, 44 and Sébastien, 47.The relationship between the adolescent pupil and his after-school drama club teacher became a scandalous topic in Amiens. Noguès and her husband had urged their son to stop seeing her until he was 18. ""He replied he would rather give up his studies than be separated from her,"" Noguès recalls. ""Brigitte also said she thought parting would be impossible.""The future president was sent off to Paris to finish school at a prestigious lycée and Brigitte visited him on weekends, eventually divorcing her husband, who died in 2019, aged 69.At the wedding reception in Le Touquet in 2007, Macron is reported to have told Brigitte's family in an after-dinner speech: ""Thank you for accepting us, for having loved us as we are ... Particularly, I wanted to thank the children of Brigitte. If there's anyone for whom this might not have been simple, it's them.""People who have seen them together are struck by how close they seem as a couple — certainly in relation to previous presidential duos: Mitterrand kept a mistress and illegitimate daughter at the expense of the state and Sarkozy divorced and remarried in office. Hollande booted his girlfriend out of the palace to install an actress as première dame.""Macron is probably the first faithful president we've had since Pompidou,"" says Françoise Degois, author of The Man Who Had No Friends, a political essay covering Macron's five-year term. ""Politics is not his first love like the others. Brigitte is.""After the show, Dusapin and Darel invite me to dinner at Macron's favourite restaurant, La Rotonde, a famous art deco brasserie in the Montparnasse district.As we head south in the composer's second-hand Jaguar, the conversation turns to the growing national clivage — the societal ""fracture"", as Chirac used to call it.From the back of the car, David Madec, administrator of the Panthéon, recalls the solemn, pomp-filled ceremony Macron presided over in November when Josephine Baker, the stage performer, civil rights campaigner and wartime resistance hero, became the first black woman to be interred in the mausoleum.""What was extraordinary was the number of vicious, hate-filled messages we got from people opposed to the idea,"" he says. Darel chips in: ""The hostility against Macron is incredible.""A recent book, Macron, Why So Much Hatred? by Nicolas Domenach and Maurice Szafran, claims that no leader has attracted such acrimony since Louis XVI was executed by guillotine in 1793.We take our seats at La Rotonde, whose heritage goes back to Picasso and Modigliani — the latter used to pay for meals with his paintings. Now replicas hang on the walls.Today's most famous regular is Macron. La Rotonde is where he celebrated his victory in the first round of the election in 2017. Since then, I learn, there have been two attempts to burn the place down, apparently because of the association with him.The president, who likes the oysters, often used to turn up at the restaurant years ago as a young economics minister with his British counterpart, George Osborne.Since he entered the Élysée, relations with Britain have soured over Brexit: the fiercely pro-European French president criticised the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine and on one occasion called Boris Johnson a ""clown"" in a private conversation with advisers.British officials are just as scathing about the Frenchman, one recently describing Macron to me as a ""scaly-legged narcissist"". So much for the entente cordiale.Will winning a second term make him any more successful at healing France's divisions or managing better relations with Britain?He has expressed regret for his high-handed, top-down leadership style, promising, if given a second chance, more widespread consultation.Already, he likes to boast, the rate of unemployment is at its lowest level in 15 years. He is promising to achieve full employment in his next term if the electorate allows him the opportunity.In a gesture likely to warm Brigitte's heart, he is also promising to reform the education system, rewarding teachers more fairly for their work. For healing the societal rift, he proposes a ""Republican pact"" — details are, as yet, sketchy.One of the most remarkable features of his re-election campaign, though, is a pledge to push ahead with a reform of the pension system and raise the retirement age from 62 to 65 — the very reforms that have been abandoned by one government after another over the past two decades because of prolonged protests and strikes.""He does not avoid difficult subjects,"" Darel says. Dusapin agrees: ""To raise this subject in the middle of an election campaign is very courageous."" For him, there is no alternative to Macron. ""He supports the humanist and republican values that we share.""For some analysts, though, France needs a lot more. Koenig, the philosopher, 39, wants a new constitution, an end to the quasi-monarchy allowing Macron so many powers.""Britain has gone from Thatcher to Blair to Brexit — big changes,"" he says. France, by contrast, is immobile. ""In France, it is all about the relationship of one man and the people. One man is supposed to know everything and solve everything, even the potholes on village streets. People don't go to their representatives to complain about things. They take to the streets.""Koenig rode a horse around the country in 2020 in order to gauge the popular mood ahead of his own presidential campaign. In the end he did not win enough endorsements from mayors to continue his quixotic quest for the throne.But what he discovered on his equine odyssey — besides how to change a horseshoe — was disquiet with a paternalistic, monarchical system run from Paris and, as the TV presenter Pernaut had himself warned years before his death, a growing sense of alienation in la France profonde, the hinterland, which feels scorned by the Parisian elite.Although Macron is almost certain to be re-elected, Koenig thinks the next revolution is coming.""The country is reaching breaking point,"" he says. ""People don't feel they are in command of their own destiny. They feel they're not allowed to do anything, even repair a village roof, without it going all the way up the chain to Paris."" His journey through France left him deeply uneasy.""France is in ferment. The pressure keeps building, I don't know when it will blow. But one day it will.""Vive la revolution""Macron out!"" and ""Long live the people's war"" were among the slogans of the French gilets jaunes protesters who in 2018-19 vented fury at high fuel prices, low wages and their feeling of provincial powerlessness against urban elites.While Macron has had some success since then in freeing up the French economy and bringing down unemployment, deep grievances remain.Politicians on the far right play on the fear that Muslim immigrants are a threat to traditional French culture; others on the far left had (before the war in Ukraine) preferred Russia to the US. In the middle weaves Macron.A survey in January found that 52 per cent thought ""experts"", not elected politicians, should run the country; 39 per cent wanted an unelected strongman and 27 per cent said the army should take control.

And elements of Christian culture have long been present at political rallies.

Photo / APThese Christians are joining secular members of the right wing, including media-savvy opportunists and those touting disinformation. They represent a wide array of discontent, from opposing vaccine mandates to promoting election conspiracy theories. For many, pandemic restrictions that temporarily closed houses of worship accelerated their distrust of government and made churchgoing political.Related articlesWorldHillsong, once a leader of Christian cool, loses footing30 Mar, 2022 07:00 PMQuick ReadLifestyleDavid Farrier: Kiwis sucked in by US conspiracy theories and alt-right5 Mar, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadWorldMany faith leaders wary of religious exemptions for vaccine14 Feb, 2022 11:39 AMQuick ReadNew ZealandJarrod Gilbert: The moment police should have intervened in Wellington21 Feb, 2022 05:00 AMQuick ReadAt a Trump rally in Michigan last weekend, a local evangelist offered a prayer that stated, ""Father in heaven, we firmly believe that Donald Trump is the current and true president of the United States."" He prayed ""in Jesus' name"" that precinct delegates at the upcoming Michigan Republican Party convention would support Trump-endorsed candidates, whose names he listed to the crowd.""In Jesus' name,"" the crowd cheered back.The infusion of explicitly religious fervour — much of it rooted in the charismatic tradition, which emphasises the power of the Holy Spirit — into the right-wing movement is changing the atmosphere of events and rallies, many of which feature Christian symbols and rituals, especially praise music.With spiritual mission driving political ideals, the stakes of any conflict, whether over masks or school curricula, can feel that much larger, and compromise can be even more difficult to achieve. Political ambitions come to be about defending God, pointing to a desire to build a nation that actively promotes a particular set of Christian beliefs.""What is refreshing for me is, this isn't at all related to church, but we are talking about God,"" said Patty Castillo Porter, who attended the Phoenix event. She is an accountant and officer with a local Republican committee to represent ""the voice of the Grassroots/America First posse"" and said she loved meeting so many Christians at the rallies she attends to protest election results, border policy or Covid mandates.""Now God is relevant,"" she said. ""You name it, God is there, because people know you can't trust your politicians, you can't trust your sheriffs, you can't trust law enforcement. The only one you can trust is God right now.""AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The parking lot vigil was sponsored by a right-wing voter mobilisation effort focused on dismantling election policy. Not everyone there knew the words to Way Maker, the contemporary Christian megahit. A few men, armed with guns and accompanied by a German shepherd, stood at the edge of the gathering, smoking and talking about what they were seeing on Infowars, a website that traffics in conspiracy theories. Others, many of whom attended charismatic or evangelical churches, sang along.Worship elements embedded into these events are recognisably evangelical. There is prayer and proclamation, shared rituals and stories. Perhaps the most powerful element is music. The anthems of the contemporary evangelical church, many of which were written in just the last few years, are blending with rising political anger, becoming the soundtrack to a new fight.A growing belief among conservative Christians is that the United States is on the cusp of a revival, one where spiritual and political change are bound together. Photo / APReligious music, prayer and symbols have been part of protest settings throughout American history, for diverging causes, including the Civil Rights movement. Music is personal, able to move listeners in ways sermons or speeches cannot. Singing unites people in body and mind and creates a sense of being part of a story, a song, greater than yourself.The sheer dominance of worship music within 21st-century evangelical culture means that the genre has been used outside church settings by the contemporary left as well. Way Maker, for example, was sung at some demonstrations for racial justice in the summer of 2020.The use of music is now key to movement-building power on the right.At the protest that paralysed the Canadian capital in February, a group of demonstrators belted out, ""I raise a hallelujah, my weapon is a melody"" from a hit from the influential California label Bethel Music. Amid the honks of trucks, they called on God to metaphorically topple the walls of Parliament, recalling the biblical story of how God crumbled the walls of Jericho, and to end vaccine mandates.At a recent conference in Arizona promoting anti-vaccine messages and election conspiracy theories, organisers blasted Fresh Wind, from the global church Hillsong, and a rock-rap novelty song with a chorus that began, ""We will not comply.""A growing belief among conservative Christians is that the United States is on the cusp of a revival, one where spiritual and political change are bound together.""We are seeing a spiritual awakening taking place,"" said Ché Ahn, the pastor of Harvest Rock Church in Pasadena, who became a hero to many when his church successfully sued Governor Gavin Newsom of California for banning indoor worship during the pandemic. ""Christians are becoming more involved, becoming activists. I think that is a good thing, because the church has been slumbering.""The explicit use of evangelical worship for partisan protest took root in the early pandemic lockdowns — notably, after California banned indoor church services and singing. Sean Feucht, a worship leader from Northern California, ran a failed campaign for Congress in 2020 and then launched a series of outdoor events, titled ""Let Us Worship"", to defy pandemic restrictions. Thousands of Christians flocked to his events, where prayer and singing took on a new valence of defiance.When Feucht staged a worship event on the National Mall last September 11, Trump contributed a video in which he praised Feucht for ""uniting citizens of all denominations and backgrounds to promote faith and freedom in America"". Even before the pandemic, he and other worship leaders were courted by Trump, who identified celebrities within the charismatic movement as natural allies.Church v stateSince late last year, rallies and protests against Covid restrictions have expanded to include other conservative causes. On the San Diego waterfront in January, local activists who opposed vaccine and mask mandates held a worship protest called ""Freedom Revival"", which combined Christian music with conservative speakers and booths promoting gun ownership and ballot initiatives that opposed medical mandates.Shaun Frederickson, one of the organisers, who has resisted the San Diego municipal government's Covid response and called it ""propaganda"", said it was wrong to understand the event simply as protesting Covid-related mandates. It was about something deeper, he said in an interview: the idea that Christian morality is the necessary foundation for governance in a free republic.""Christians are the ones that are responsible for granting you and myself the right and authority over government,"" he said. ""Our motivation with the worship was to entertain people that need to be entertained, while we are going to hit them heavy with truth.""At the revival, as worship music played gently, Frederickson, in a cardigan and cuffed skinny jeans, urged the crowd to not believe ""the lie"" of the separation of church and state.Among the speakers was Heidi St. John, a home-schooling advocate running for Congress in Washington state. She praised Moses' mother — ""She did not comply!"" — and exhorted people to leave their churches if their pastors were too politically ""timid"".Ahn, the pastor of Harvest Rock Church in Pasadena, who also spoke at the event, said he did not see it simply as a worship service or a political rally. ""It is both,"" he said. ""My understanding of Jesus' kingdom is that he is Lord, not just over the church, but every aspect of society. That means family, education, arts, entertainment, business for sure, and government.""Worship is increasingly becoming a central feature of right-wing events not aimed at exclusively Christian audiences.ReAwaken America events, hosted by an Oklahoma talk-show personality and entrepreneur, are touted as gatherings of ""truth-seekers"" who oppose pandemic precautions, believe that the 2020 election was stolen, distrust Black Lives Matter and want to explore ""what really happened"" on January 6. Most of the events are hosted by large churches, and the primary sponsor is Charisma News, a media outlet serving charismatic Christians.'Take our country back'In February, a ReAwaken event at Trinity Gospel Temple in Canton, Ohio, opened with a set of worship music from Melody Noel Altavilla, a songwriter and worship leader at Influence Church in Anaheim, California. ""Your presence fills the temple when we worship you,"" Altavilla sang. The music soared in the darkened sanctuary.In an interview, Altavilla said she was excited to be asked to perform because it was a chance to ""create space for God"" at a secular event.She said she felt increasingly called to political action as part of her duty as a Christian. She recalled a biblical account in which men singing and praying went ahead of the Israelite army into battle. ""Imagine if the armies in the Old Testament said, 'No, Lord, this is too political; the worshippers can't go out in front of the soldiers,'"" she said.Compared with 2016, Trump rallies are taking on the feel of worship events, from the stage to the audience. When Trump held his first rally of the year in Florence, Arizona, in January, he descended via helicopter into a jubilant crowd.""I lay the key of David upon you,"" Anthony Kern, a candidate for the Arizona state Senate who was photographed on the Capitol steps on January 6, 2021, proclaimed to the crowd from the stage, paraphrasing a biblical passage about power given by God. ""That means the governmental authority is upon you, men and women.""Standing in the crowd, Kathy Stainbrook closed her eyes and raised her arms high in worship. She had come from Shasta County, California, with a group of Christian women involved in the Shasta County Freedom Coalition, a collection of right-wing groups that has included a militia, according to its website, and has supported an effort to recall a Republican county supervisor. The coalition also promotes ""biblical citizenship"" classes.A friend of Stainbrook's, Tami Jackson, who was also in the crowd, said she had come to see politics as an inherently spiritual struggle.She said she wanted to be a part of ""staking claim"" to what God was doing. ""This is a Jesus movement,"" Jackson said. ""I believe God removed Donald for a time so the church would wake up and have confidence in itself again to take our country back.""This article originally appeared in The New York Times.
