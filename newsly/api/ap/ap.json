      "description": "Thousands of protesters took to the street in Los Angeles on Sunday in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. The demonstrations centered on a cluster of federal buildings including a detention center where immigrants arrested on Friday were taken. As the protests swelled on Sunday, demonstrators blocked a freeway entrance, set self-driving cars on fire and threw objects including concrete and electric scooters at law enforcement officers and vehicles. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell says some of the protesters engaging in the most aggressive behavior are agitators looking to cause trouble.",

      "description": "Russia launched 479 drones at Ukraine in the war\u2019s biggest overnight drone bombardment, the Ukrainian air force said. As well as the drones, 20 missiles of various types were fired at different parts of Ukraine, the air force said Monday. The attacks usually start late in the evening and end in the morning, because drones are harder to spot in the dark. Russia has targeted civilian areas of Ukraine with Shahed drones since the start of the war. The attacks have killed more that 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. A recent escalation in aerial attacks has coincided with a renewed Russian battlefield push on eastern and northeastern parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has banned travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 countries and restricted access for people from seven others. He cited national security concerns in resurrecting and expanding a hallmark policy of his first term that will mostly affect people from Africa and the Middle East. The ban took effect Monday and does not have an end date. International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations roundly condemned the ban. Early in Trump\u2019s first term, he issued an executive order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. The order was retooled amid legal challenges until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.",

      "description": "The FBI under the leadership of Director Kash Patel has made fighting violent crime and illegal immigration top priorities. That effort brings the bureau into alignment with the vision of President Donald Trump, who has made a crackdown on illegal immigration, cartels and transnational gangs a cornerstone of his administration. The FBI said in a statement that its dedication to investigating terrorism had not changed but acknowledged that it \u201ccontinuously analyzes the threat landscape\u201d and makes adjustments as necessary. Yet some are concerned the heightened focus on violent crime and immigration risks diverting attention from some of the complicated criminal and national security threats for which the bureau has long borne primary responsibility for investigating.",
