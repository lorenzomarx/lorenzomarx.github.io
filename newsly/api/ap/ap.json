      "description": "President Donald Trump has used his social media account to share a video about election conspiracy theories that includes a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle. The Republican president's Thursday night post also amplified his false claims that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent. Trump's post has drawn bipartisan backlash for its treatment of the nation\u2019s first Black president and first lady, who are Democrats. Black Republican Sen. Tim Scott is among those criticizing the post as racist. The White House is pushing back against criticism of the post. An Obama spokeswoman says the former president has no response.",

      "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein files have rocked Europe's elite, revealing ties to a prince, an ambassador, and top politicians. The U.S. Department of Justice released documents that have ended careers and sparked investigations. King Charles III's brother lost his titles and home. Ex-U.K. ambassador Peter Mandelson was fired and may face prison. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is in crisis for appointing Mandelson. Norway, Sweden and Slovakia have seen senior figures fall. Experts say the files expose Epstein's powerful network in Europe. The fallout contrasts with a more limited impact so far in the U.S. where only a handful of prominent Epstein associates have lost their jobs.",

The apparent kidnapping of \u201cToday\u201d show host Savannah Guthrie\u2019s mother has raised questions about real-life hostage negotiations. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was taken from her home outside Tucson, Arizona. A local TV station received two alleged ransom letters demanding money for her return. Law enforcement hasn't confirmed the authenticity of these notes. Experts say kidnappings for ransom are uncommon and usually involve careful planning. The family has released videos appealing to the kidnappers. Patience and avoiding media attention can be crucial in these situations.",

Alberto Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n says federal agents began hitting him right after they pulled him from a vehicle. He was hospitalized with eight skull fractures and five life-threatening brain hemorrhages. Officers claimed he ran into a wall, but medical staff immediately doubted that account. His case has sparked calls for accountability and transparency. Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n, who entered the U.S. legally, faces a long recovery and uncertain future. He hopes to stay in the U.S. and support his family despite fears of another encounter with ICE.",

The joint statement, released Friday, follows U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement to reduce import tariffs on India. This comes six months after imposing taxes to press New Delhi to cut its reliance on Russian crude. Under the deal, tariffs on Indian goods would drop to 18% from 25%. India would also reduce tariffs on U.S. goods. The agreement aims to support resilient supply chains. However, Indian opposition parties argue it favors the U.S. and impacts sensitive sectors like agriculture.",

Republicans have cut Medicaid through new work requirements and declined to extend COVID-era subsidies, leading to increased costs for Affordable Care Act plans. Democrats are using campaign ads and personal stories to emphasize the impact on Americans. On Saturday, Sen. Jon Ossoff plans to address health care challenges in Georgia. Republicans have struggled to pass legislation to offset health costs, making it a weak point for them. Democrats see this as an opportunity to gain political leverage in upcoming campaigns.",
