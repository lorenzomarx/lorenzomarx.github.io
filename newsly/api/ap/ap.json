      "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a key scientific finding that supported U.S. regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. This decision rescinds a 2009 declaration that carbon dioxide and other gases endanger public health. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the move Thursday, calling it a major deregulatory action. Critics argue it undermines efforts to combat climate change and could lead to more pollution. Environmental groups are certain to challenge the action in court. The EPA also proposes delaying a Biden-era rule on vehicle emissions, which could impact the push for electric vehicles.",

      "description": "While announcing that he was rolling back the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2009 endangerment finding, President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made false claims regarding the government declaration, climate change and energy. For example, he said the finding has no basis in fact, but it followed a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that greenhouse gases are air pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Trump also made false claims about the effects of climate change, the cost of wind energy and the idea of an electric vehicle mandate.",

She described Epstein as \u201canother older brother\u201d and downplayed his sex crimes. Ruemmler had previously tried to distance herself from these emails.

Mark Kelly, a former U.S. Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.

Four justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing two lower courts\u2019 rulings that found the adoption was so flawed it was void from the moment it was issued. The justices wrote that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child\u2019s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.",
