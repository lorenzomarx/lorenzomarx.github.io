      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has left Qatar for the United Arab Emirates on the final leg of his Middle East tour. Trump will visit the country\u2019s largest mosque, where the country's founder is buried in a courtyard. Trump also will be hosted for a state visit by the UAE's president at a palace. Trump wrapped up his visit to Qatar by stopping at a U.S. installation Thursday, telling troops his \u201cpriority is to end conflicts.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump said he wasn't surprised Russian President Vladimir Putin will be a no-show for anticipated peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey. Earlier this week, Trump met with Syria\u2019s president and announced plans to ease sanctions on the war-torn country.",

      "description": "A hospital in southern Gaza says 54 people have been killed in overnight airstrikes on the city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press cameraman counted 10 airstrikes on the city overnight into Thursday and saw numerous bodies taken to the morgue in Nasser Hospital. Some bodies arrived in pieces, with some body bags containing the remains of multiple people. The hospital\u2019s morgue confirmed 54 people had been killed. The strikes come as U.S. President Donald Trump visits the Middle East, visiting Gulf states but not Israel. There had been hope that Trump\u2019s regional visit could usher in a ceasefire or renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza. An Israeli blockade of the territory is now in its third month.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in its first case stemming from the flurry of actions marking the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Before the court Thursday are the Trump administration\u2019s emergency appeals of lower court orders putting nationwide holds on the Republican president\u2019s push to deny citizenship to children born to people who are in the U.S. illegally. Birthright citizenship is among several issues the administration has urgently asked the court to deal with, after lower courts acted to slow Trump\u2019s agenda. The administration, like the Biden administration before it, complains judges are overreaching by issuing nationwide injunctions that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.",

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan entered the plea during an arraignment Thursday in federal court. She and her lawyers left after the brief hearing without talking to reporters. Dugan is charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. According to an FBI affidavit, Dugan showed a man out the back door of her courtroom last month after learning immigration agents were in the courthouse looking to arrest him for being in the country illegally. The case has escalated a clash between Trump administration and Democrats over the president\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown.",

People with student loans had their payments and interest paused five years ago when the pandemic thrust many into financial hardship. But all extensions and grace periods are over and the federal government said this month it would restart the garnishment of paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security benefits. Student loan debt among older people has grown at a staggering rate. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the number of Social Security beneficiaries who have had their payments garnished has ballooned by 3,000% over the past two decades.",
