      "description": "A month after Iran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests, widespread arrests are roiling the country. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up. Activists say those who are arrested are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000 and the number of the deaths at more than 7,000.",

That includes the Transportation Security Administration, whose officers are responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports. Experts say mass flight cancellations like those seen during the 2025 shutdown are less likely this time because air traffic controllers are still getting paid. But TSA officers are required to stay on the job without pay during the Homeland Security shutdown that started on Saturday. Experts warn of long security lines if the shutdown drags on and more officers take unscheduled absences. Travel and airline industry groups warn the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel period approaches.",
