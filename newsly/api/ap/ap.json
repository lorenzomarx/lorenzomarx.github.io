      "description": "Russia launched 550 drones and missiles across Ukraine overnight in the largest aerial assaults since the war began. The capital Kyiv was the primary target. At least 23 people were injured, and multiple residential buildings in the capital were damaged. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 270 targets and another 208 targets were lost from radar and presumed jammed, but dozens still struck or caused damage across the city. Fires and destruction were reported in at least five of Kyiv's 10 districts, and railway infrastructure was also hit. The attack came hours after President Donald Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and made his first public comments on the U.S. decision to pause some shipments of weapons to Ukraine.",

      "description": "Israeli airstrikes killed 15 Palestinians in Gaza early on Friday, while a hospital said another 20 people died in shootings while waiting for aid. Meanwhile, the U.N. human rights office says it has recorded 613 killings in Gaza near humanitarian convoys and aid distribution points run by an Israeli-backed American organization since it first began operations in late May. Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the rights office was not able to attribute responsibility for the killings.

Search teams used boats to conduct rescues Friday as fast-moving water threatened riverfront communities near wildlife habitats and campgrounds. As much as 10 inches of heavy rain fell over just a few hours overnight in central Kerr County, causing flash flooding of the Guadalupe River. The Kerr County sheriff\u2019s office confirmed fatalities but did not provide additional details. A flood watch issued Thursday afternoon estimated isolated amounts up to seven inches. That shifted to a flood warning for at least 30,000 people overnight. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, strong thunderstorms are being blamed for at least three deaths.",

The 5-foot-long scroll is a handwritten declaration signed by 116 New England ministers saying they \u201cdisapprove and abhor the system of American slavery.\u201d The document was signed two years after the issue of slavery prompted Baptists in the south to break away and form the Southern Baptist Convention.

Organizers see the coming year of festivities, which start Thursday, as a way to help unite a polarized country and bridge partisan divides. But a recent Gallup poll showed the widest partisan split in patriotism in over two decades, with only about a third of Democrats saying they are proud to be American compared with about 9 in 10 Republicans. As a candidate, Trump proposed a \u201cGreat American State Fair\u201d in Iowa, but it will take place next year in Washington instead.",

The 41-year-old from Westfield, Indiana, secured his 17th Mustard Belt in 20 appearances before cheering fans at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York.

Defending champion Miki Sudo won her 11th title in the women\u2019s division. The event, held outside the original Nathan\u2019s Famous restaurant, dates back to 1972 and draws large crowds of fans in foam hot-dog hats.",
