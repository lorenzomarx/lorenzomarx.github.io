      "description": "Following reports of deportations to South Sudan, the Trump administration says it's deported eight migrants convicted of crimes in the United States. Immigration authorities declined on Wednesday to say what their final destinations would be. But officials said their home countries had refused to receive the migrants. Immigration rights lawyers have said that the deportations violated a court order against deporting people to countries other than their homelands without first allowing them to argue the removal could put them in danger.",

      "description": "The United States once cheered the creation of South Sudan as an independent nation. Now the U.S. is being asked to explain why it appears to be deporting migrants from as far away as Vietnam to a chaotic country that\u2019s once again in danger of civil war. A U.S. judge ordered Trump administration officials to appear at an emergency hearing Wednesday. Here\u2019s a look at South Sudan, whose own people had been granted U.S. temporary protected status because of insecurity at home.",

Israel began allowing dozens of humanitarian trucks into Gaza on Tuesday, but the aid has not yet reached Palestinians in desperate need, according to aid groups. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israel recently ordered new evacuations pending an expected expanded offensive, 24 people were killed, 14 of them from the same family. The week-old infant was killed in central Gaza.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package is at risk of stalling. House Speaker Mike Johnson and conservative Republican holdouts are heading to the White House later Wednesday for the last-ditch talks to salvage the bill. Johnson had hoped to vote as soon as Wednesday on the 1,000-page plus bill after grinding through an all-night committee hearing. But debate dragged into midday. Democrats lack the votes to stop Trump\u2019s package, so they're using all available tools to press their opposition. Conservatives are angry at last-minute deals and worried the package will added to the nation\u2019s debt. The Congressional Budget Office says the tax provisions would add $3.8 trillion to federal deficits.",

He'll tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs' ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie. Cassie testified last week that Combs was enraged when she left him for a period of time in 2011 and began dating Cudi. Prosecutors say Combs was so upset that he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he oversaw a racketeering enterprise that controlled Cassie and others through threats and violence. His lawyers say the evidence doesn't amount to a criminal racket or sex trafficking.",

The digital asset traded above $109,400 Wednesday morning, a huge increase from recent lows of about $75,000 last month. Several other cryptocurrencies have seen similar large gains in recent days. That includes Trump\u2019s official meme coins, which have jumped up about 75% in the last month. Bitcoin\u2019s price increase comes after the crypto industry scored a major win with the U.S. Senate advancing legislation that creates a federal framework to regulate the stablecoins, a fast-growing form of cryptocurrency whose values are often tied to the U.S. dollar.",
