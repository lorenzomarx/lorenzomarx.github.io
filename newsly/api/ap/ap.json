The hospitals and medics said women and children were among the dead. The bloodshed came as Israel launches an escalation of its war in Gaza, which it says is meant to ramp up pressure on Hamas to agree to a temporary ceasefire.

      "description": "The war in the Gaza Strip has reached one of its darkest periods, as Israel\u2019s blockade of all food and supplies enters its 12th week and it wages another major offensive against Hamas. Hundreds have been killed in recent days, experts have warned of a looming famine and doctors say overwhelmed hospitals are running out of medicine to treat even routine conditions. The military is preparing for a new organization with U.S. backing to take over aid delivery, despite alarms raised by humanitarian groups that say the plans won\u2019t meet the massive need and could weaponize food delivery. The Trump administration has voiced full support for Israel's actions.",

Sunday's ceremony in St. Peter's Square blends ancient ritual, evocative symbols and a nod to modern-day celebrity. Leo will start the day by taking his first tour through the piazza in the popemobile. The open-topped vehicle has become synonymous with the papacy\u2019s global reach and mediatic draw. Leo will receive the two potent symbols of the papacy during the Mass. They are the lambswool stole known as a pallium. And the fisherman\u2019s ring.",

      "description": "The Trump administration has been pushing back against certain court rulings it doesn't like in the hundreds of cases filed against it in the past few months. One federal judge has found the administration may be liable for contempt. While the administration has complied with the vast majority of rulings against it, the intensity of its pushback is unusual to legal observers. The Republican-controlled Congress is trying to use its budget bill to undermine the courts' power to enforce contempt rulings. That's rarely used against the government, but the provision in the bill is a sign that some are concerned about it happening.",

But it's taken even more drastic steps than his first to shield key documents and information from the public. That kind of secrecy suggests Trump's second term will leave less for the nation\u2019s historical record than any before it. It also suggests that what the administration eventually does authorize for release will be sanitized to reinforce a public image the president himself wants projected, no matter what the facts might say. There's a question about how experts and their fellow Americans will fully understand what went on during Trump\u2019s term.",
