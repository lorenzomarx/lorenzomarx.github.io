The strikes targeted several regions, including western Ukraine, far from the front lines. Officials confirmed two deaths, one in Kherson and another in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine\u2019s air force said one of its F-16 warplanes supplied by its Western partners crashed after sustaining damage while shooting down air targets. The pilot died.",

By a 51-49 tally and with Vice President JD Vance at the Capitol to break a potential tie, the Senate cleared a key procedural step Saturday as midnight approached. Voting had come to a standstill, dragging for more than three hours, with holdout senators huddling for negotiations and taking private meetings off the Senate floor. The Senate's top Democrat has forced a full reading of 940-page bill. That began late Saturday and has continued into Sunday morning.",

The Vatican\u2019s promotional efforts this year include videos, posters, and online donation options.

Mamdani's performance in this past week's Democratic primary also signals a sea change in the priorities of one of the party\u2019s most loyal voting groups. An ideological realignment has been taking place among American Jews since the Hamas attack on Israel in 2023.

The effort was supposed to be finished years ago, but slow work, poor record-keeping and residents' mistrust in their local government caused extensive delays. There's now a federal mandate for communities to replace their lead pipes, so lessons from Flint's failures are valuable nationwide. One place that used them was Newark, New Jersey, which experienced a lead crisis after Flint. They made it easier for residents to approve pipe replacement work and targeted properties systematically.",
