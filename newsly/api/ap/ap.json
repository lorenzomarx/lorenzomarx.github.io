      "description": "President Donald Trump has offered rare criticism of Vladimir Putin, urging the Russian president to \u201cSTOP!\u201d after a deadly barrage of attacks on Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. Trump said in a social media post on Thursday that \u201cI am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying.\" Trump also said, \u201cLets get the Peace Deal DONE!\u201d Russia attacked the city with an hourslong barrage of missiles and drones, killing at least nine people and injuring more than 70. It's deadliest assault there since last July and comes just as peace efforts are coming to a head.",

      "description": "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is cutting short his official trip to South Africa and returning home after a Russian strike on Kyiv killed at least nine people and injured more than 70. The Russian attack on Kyiv came hours after weeks of peace negotiations appeared to be coming to a head without an agreement in sight. President Donald Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy on Wednesday, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by refusing to surrender the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula as part of a possible peace deal. Zelenskyy has repeated many times during the more than three-year war that recognizing occupied territory as Russian is a red line for his country.",

      "description": "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from immediately enacting certain changes to how federal election are run, including adding a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form. President Donald Trump had called for that and other sweeping changes to U.S. elections in an executive order signed in March. The Republican president argued the U.S. \u201cfails to enforce basic and necessary election protections\u201d that exist in other countries. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sided with voting rights groups and Democrats to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the citizenship requirement from moving forward while the lawsuit plays out. The parties in the case didn't immediately comment on the judge's order.",

The high court filing Thursday follows a brief order from a federal appeals court that kept in place a court order blocking the policy nationwide. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy that presumptively disqualifies transgender people from military service, after the Republican president signed an executive order claiming the sexual identity of transgender service members is harmful to military readiness. A federal judge in Tacoma, Washington, ruled for several transgender military members who challenged the ban, saying their firing would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations.",

India accused Islamabad of supporting \u201ccross-border terrorism\u201d Wednesday night and imposed diplomatic measures, including downgrading diplomatic ties, suspending of a key water-sharing treaty and closing the main land border crossing with Pakistan. Pakistan has denied the accusation and a previously unknown militant group calling itself Kashmir Resistance has claimed responsibility for the attack. Islamabad said it would respond to India\u2019s actions on Thursday and convene its National Security Committee, which is composed of senior civil and military officials.",

He was sentenced Thursday after relatives of those killed in the shooting and other survivors gave emotional testimony. Robert E. Crimo III pleaded guilty to the shooting last month just moments before his trial was to begin. Authorities say the 24-year-old fired into crowds at the parade from a rooftop. Dozens were wounded in the shooting in a suburb north of Chicago.",

The former roommate, Elizabeth Entin, testified Thursday at Weinstein's rape retrial. She's one of many witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after Weinstein was convicted in the landmark #MeToo case. An appeals court overturned his conviction last year, leading to the retrial. The prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different from those involved in the first trial. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting or raping anyone.",

It creeps along spiderwebs, feeding on trapped insects and decorating its silk case with body parts. The caterpillar's origins go back at least 6 million years \u2014 more ancient than the Hawaiian islands themselves. A host of caterpillars native to Hawaii use silk glands to spin protective cases, but the bone collector is the first to use ant heads and fly wings. The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
