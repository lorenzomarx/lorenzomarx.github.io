Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on CNN on Sunday that the existence of \u201chorrible photographs\u201d and troubling email correspondence does not \u201callow us necessarily to prosecute somebody.\u201d Department officials said over the summer that a review of records from Epstein investigations did not establish a basis for new criminal investigations, a position that Blanche said remains unchanged even as a massive document dump since Friday has focused fresh attention on his links to powerful individuals around the world and revived questions about what, if any, knowledge the wealthy financier\u2019s contacts had about his crimes.",

Johnson tells \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he's relying on help from President Donald Trump to ensure passage, possibly Tuesday. Trump struck a deal with senators to separate out the homeland security funding from a broader package. That gives two weeks for Congress to debate and vote on new restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.",

      "description": "Democrat Taylor Rehmet won a special election for the Texas state Senate and flipped a reliably Republican district that President Donald Trump won by 17 points in 2024. Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican and conservative activist Leigh Wambsganss in the Fort Worth-area district. His victory added to Democrats\u2019 record of overperforming in special elections so far this cycle. Trump used his social media platform to urge voters to support Wambsganss, but Rehmet had support from national organizations. The victory allows Rehmet to serve only until early January, and he must win the November general election to keep the seat after that.",

Thousands of Palestinians await medical evacuations, and thousands of others want to return home.

The administration has dismantled Black history at national parks, most recently a slavery exhibit in Philadelphia. In the 100th year since the nation's earliest celebrations of Black history, the current political climate has energized civil rights organizations, artists and academics to engage young people on a full telling of America's story. Hundreds of lectures, teach-ins and new books are planned to mark Black History Month, which originated as historian Carter G. Woodson's idea for a Negro History Week in 1926.",
