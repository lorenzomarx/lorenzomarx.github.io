      "description": "An Israeli probe into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics last month in Gaza by Israeli forces says it has found \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and a deputy commander will be fired. Israel at first claimed that the medics\u2019 vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked. Cellphone video recovered from one of the medics contradicted Israel\u2019s initial account. The military investigation said Sunday that the deputy battalion commander, \u201cdue to poor night visibility,\u201d assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants.",

      "description": "The Vatican is celebrating Easter without Pope Francis presiding. The 88-year-old pontiff continues his recovery from a near-fatal bout of double pneumonia. In his place, Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the retired archpriest of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, celebrated the open-air Mass before thousands of people in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Francis has only appeared in public a handful of times since returning to the Vatican on March 23 after a 38-day hospital stay. He skipped the solemn services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday leading up to Easter. But he was expected to make an appearance on Sunday, according to the Mass booklet and liturgical plans released by the Vatican.",

Thousands of federal workers fear they'll lose their jobs. Some have been let go. Many are considering early retirement or buyouts. One researcher expects the region could lose as many as 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would eliminate thousands more in other industries. Cuts to food aid programs have affected a farmers market and food pantry in a low-income neighborhood.
