      "description": "The Supreme Court has again cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip temporary legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants, pushing the total number of people who could be newly exposed to deportation to nearly 1 million. The justices on Friday lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The court has also allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.",

Andrii Yermak said in a statement that it's important for Kyiv to receive Russia\u2019s draft and there was still enough time to send it before the planned talks. The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Turkey meeting in Kyiv also suggested the possibility of a future meeting between Presidents Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin, possibly also including U.S. President Donald Trump.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has built a coalition by promising to demolish a so-called deep state that he claims is behind dark government conspiracies. But four months into his second term, his administration hasn't arrested hordes of corrupt officials or revealed massive crimes from within its ranks. As a result, some of the president's supporters who took him at his word are getting restless. They are asking why his administration, which now holds the keys to chasing down these alleged government secrets, is denying them the evidence and retribution they expected. One conservative commentator lamented: \u201cPeople are tired of not knowing.\"",

But the dog lost the scent as heavy rains blew through the area on Sunday. That meant the inmate known as the \u2018Devil in the Ozarks\u2019 could have gone in any direction. Despite that early failure, experts say bloodhounds are playing a key role in the search for Hardin, now in its sixth day. They have clothing and other items Hardin left behind, which is used to give the hounds the scent they will search for.",
