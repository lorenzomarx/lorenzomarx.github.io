      "description": "The Israel-Hamas war has devastated the Gaza Strip. Satellite photos offer some sense of the destruction in the territory. Some of the images have illustrated a likely buffer zone, wanted by Israel despite international objections. It would take some 60 square kilometers out of the enclave. In all, the strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea is about 360 square kilometers. Palestinians hope it will be part of a future state, along with the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Other images tell the story of how Palestinians\u2019 lives have changed during the war. Gaza City has been decimated, with buildings destroyed and roads filled with rubble. The images have also helped relief agencies and experts make estimates regarding the extent of the damage.",

      "description": "Mediator Qatar says the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel will go into effect Sunday at 8:30 a.m. local time. Families of hostages held in Gaza are bracing Saturday for news of loved ones, while Palestinians prepare to receive freed detainees and humanitarian groups hurry to set up a surge in aid. The overnight approval of the deal by Israel\u2019s Cabinet, in a rare meeting during the Jewish Sabbath, has set off a flurry of activity and a fresh wave of emotions as relatives wonder if hostages will be returned alive or dead. The names of the first hostages to be freed are expected to be released later Saturday,",

      "description": "The Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement is expected to take effect as soon as Sunday. But the most significant diplomatic breakthrough in over a year of brutal war between Israel and Hamas is rife with risks, and seems to raise more questions than it answers. The deal presented Friday to the Israeli Cabinet after months of negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar appears ridden with diplomatic ambiguity. It leaves the issues that most inflame tensions between Israel and Hamas up for further negotiation. That is stirring fears that, failing a second agreement, the war could resume within weeks.",

But after 469 days of captivity in Gaza, his daughter can only hope he survived. Sharone Lifschitz is well aware that the odds are against her 84-year-old father. The London-based artist spoke Friday to The Associated Press. About 100 hostages remain unaccounted for in Gaza, including 62 who are believed to be alive. Family and friends are still waiting to learn who survived and about their conditions. The ceasefire deal is expected to begin Sunday.",

      "description": "TikTok arrived in the U.S. almost 6 1/2 years ago. The possibility the U.S. would outlaw the video-sharing app has kept influencers and users in anxious limbo for more than four of the years since then. Now, the moment its fans dreaded is here, but uncertainty over TikTok\u2019s future lingers. On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that bans the social media platform starting Sunday unless its China-based parent company sells to an approved buyer. An official says the Biden administration plans to leave the law\u2019s implementation to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Monday. During its short life, TikTok has been both a global cultural phenomenon and the subject of political wrangling.",

Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield gains to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks to end the 3-year-old war. Their tough negotiating postures leave little room for compromise. Russian troops are slowly but steadily advancing through Ukrainian defenses in the east and south, seeking to establish full control of the four regions that Moscow illegally annexed early in the war but doesn't completely control. Ukraine, in turn, has tried to secure and extend its incursion in Russia\u2019s Kursk region.",
