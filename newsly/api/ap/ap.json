      "description": "British police are holding a 53-year-old man over a collision that turned a joyous soccer celebration in Liverpool to tragedy and sent more than two dozen people to hospitals. The city's mayor says four people are in very serious condition. Police said they are not treating Monday evening's incident as terrorism and are not looking for other suspects. Detectives on Tuesday were piecing together how a minivan plowed into crowds. It happened after the players of Liverpool Football Club celebrated the Premier League championship with an open-topped bus parade. The North West Ambulance Service said a total of 47 people were injured, of whom 27 were taken to local hospitals.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to deliver remarks at Arlington National Cemetery to commemorate Memorial Day. Trump on Monday placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a somber tradition for U.S. presidents. Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth joined him. Trump began the day with a decidedly different tone. In an all-caps social media message, Trump ranted at former President Joe Biden, calling him the \u201cSCUM THAT SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.\" Trump also went after federal judges who have blocked efforts to enact his mass deportation agenda.",

      "description": "Ukrainian officials say that a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least twelve people and injuring dozens. The attack early on Sunday came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month which have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers on Saturday, a day after each released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Further releases were expected on Sunday.",

      "description": "More than 200 Ukrainian POWs have died in Russian prisons since Moscow's full-scale invasion three years ago. Officials from human rights groups, the U.N. and the Ukrainian government say torture, starvation and inadequate health care were likely contributing factors in many of these deaths. These officials say the prison deaths add to evidence that Russia is systematically brutalizing POWs. And they believe that forensic discrepancies between Russian and Ukrainian autopsies, and the repatriation of bodies that are badly mutilated and decomposed, point to an effort by Russia to cover up systematic mistreatment. Russian authorities did not respond to requests for comment. But they have previously accused Ukraine of mistreating Russian POWs \u2014 allegations the U.N. has partially backed up.",

The city is still struggling to decide what should become of the intersection where Floyd met his demise, which has become a place of pilgrimage known as George Floyd Square. City leaders have not agreed on whether to close the intersection to all traffic as a permanent memorial. Minneapolis has also begun a remake of its police department under court supervision \u2014 an effort that the mayor and police chief say will continue with or without the backing of the Trump administration.",
