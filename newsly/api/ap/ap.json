      "description": "Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have little more than 48 hours to explain what they accomplished over the last week. The order is part of billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s crusade to slash what he describes as \u201cwaste everywhere\" in the federal government. Musk, who serves as President Donald Trump\u2019s cost-cutting chief, shared the extraordinary request on his social media network on Saturday. He said that \u201cfailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\u201d Shortly afterward, federal employees received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\u201d Thousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce during the first month of Trump\u2019s administration.",

      "description": "When Bill Clinton came to Washington as president, his Democratic administration used corporate know-how and the new internet to streamline the federal bureaucracy as part of the \u201cReinventing Government\u201d push. Millions of employees were offered buyouts and there were spending cuts to balance the budget. The effort led by Vice President Al Gore ended up eliminating about 400,000 federal positions and saved an estimated $146 billion. It might sound like the controversial cost-cutting push today led by billionaire Elon Musk under the auspices of Republican President Donald Trump. But the Clinton-era initiative was authorized by legislation, took several years to identify inefficiencies and involved federal workers in re-envisioning their jobs.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s week included rewriting U.S. policy toward Russia and firing the country's senior military officer. Trump sat for a chummy interview with Elon Musk and sought greater authority over independent regulatory agencies. The Republican president acknowledged that \u201cinflation is back\u201d but said he \u201chad nothing to do\u201d with prices remaining high. That excuse can only work for so long, unless the economic outlook changes. Consumer sentiment suggests that isn\u2019t happening. As the one-month mark of his second term came and went, Trump also offered increasingly fanciful pushes, including instructing officials to check Fort Knox to ensure the gold is still there and saying Musk could send humans to Mars.",
