The family\u2019s latest attempts to reach the abductors failed to yield any proof that she's alive or communication with the culprits. The FBI says it's not aware of ongoing communication between the family and the suspected kidnappers. The FBI says it hasn't identified any suspects or persons of interest in the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie. Guthrie says her family in Arizona continues to believe her mother is out there and hearing everyone\u2019s prayers. By Monday evening, a purported ransom deadline apparently set by her mom\u2019s abductors appeared to have passed.",

The allegations outlined in the affidavit are largely based on claims that have long been made by people who assert that there was fraud in the 2020 election. Audits, state officials, courts and Trump\u2019s own former attorney general have rejected the idea that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election that could have altered the outcome.",

He spoke with top Trump administration officials, including border czar Tom Homan and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Walz said Tuesday that he anticipates hearing more from the administration soon about the operation's future. Walz emphasized a \"trust but verify\" approach, as the situation could change. Walz also hopes for cooperation on joint investigations into the shooting deaths of two Minnesotans by federal officers. The crackdown has impacted local businesses, with employees and customers staying away out of fear.",

This comes amid scrutiny over the shooting deaths of two protesters in Minneapolis by Homeland Security officers. Todd Lyons of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Rodney Scott of Customs and Border Protection, and Joseph Edlow of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will appear before the House Committee on Homeland Security. Critics argue ICE and CBP officers use excessive force and violate rights. Lyons, who has led ICE since March, defends his officers' tactics. The administration's mass deportation strategy faces growing criticism and declining public support.",

It's a reversal of Lutnick\u2019s previous claim that he had cut ties with the late financier after 2005. He was questioned by Democrats during a Tuesday subcommittee hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. But Lutnick is facing calls from several lawmakers for his resignation after the release of case files on Epstein contradicted Lutnick\u2019s claims on a podcast last year that he had decided to \u201cnever be in the room\u201d with Epstein again after a 2005 tour of Epstein\u2019s home that disturbed Lutnick and his wife.",

Gaza health authorities say 586 Palestinians have been killed since the truce took effect, bringing the war\u2019s overall toll to more than 72,000. Israel says its strikes respond to ceasefire violations. Some elements of the agreement have advanced, including the return of all hostages and limited reopening of the Rafah crossing.
