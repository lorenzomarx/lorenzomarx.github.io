      "description": "The Trump administration is asking federal agencies to cancel remaining contracts with Harvard University worth about $100 million. That's according to a senior administration official Tuesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations. The government already has canceled more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants for the Ivy League school, which has pushed back on the administration\u2019s demands for changes to several of its policies. Cuts to contracts could take away millions more from Harvard\u2019s budget.",

      "description": "Chaos has erupted on the second day of aid operations by a new U.S.-backed group in Gaza. Palestinians overwhelmed a center distributing food on Tuesday, breaking through fences. An AP journalist heard tank and gunfire from nearby Israeli troops and saw a military helicopter firing flares. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the center to bring the situation under control. At least three injured Palestinians were seen being brought from the scene. The distribution hub outside Rafah had been opened the day before by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been slated by Israel to take over aid operations despite opposition from the U.N. and other humanitarian organizations.",

Authorities say there are still six people missing following Tuesday's explosion at the Gaomi Youdao Chemical Co., which is located in an industrial park in the city of Weifang. It manufactures pesticides as well as chemicals for medical use. The blast was powerful enough to knock out the windows at a storage warehouse more than two miles away from the factory, according to a video shared by a local resident, who declined to give his name out of concern for retaliation.",

The city's mayor says four people are in very serious condition. Police said they are not treating Monday evening's incident as terrorism and are not looking for other suspects. Detectives on Tuesday were piecing together how a minivan plowed into crowds. It happened after the players of Liverpool Football Club celebrated the Premier League championship with an open-topped bus parade. The North West Ambulance Service said a total of 47 people were injured, of whom 27 were taken to local hospitals.",

      "description": "More than 200 Ukrainian POWs have died in Russian prisons since Moscow's full-scale invasion three years ago. Officials from human rights groups, the U.N. and the Ukrainian government say torture, starvation and inadequate health care were likely contributing factors in many of these deaths. These officials say the prison deaths add to evidence that Russia is systematically brutalizing POWs. And they believe that forensic discrepancies between Russian and Ukrainian autopsies, and the repatriation of bodies that are badly mutilated and decomposed, point to an effort by Russia to cover up systematic mistreatment. Russian authorities did not respond to requests for comment. But they have previously accused Ukraine of mistreating Russian POWs \u2014 allegations the U.N. has partially backed up.",

She also says he later kidnapped her to help him kill fellow rapper Kid Cudi. The testimony on Tuesday from Capricorn Clark, the former global brand director for Bad Boy Entertainment, launched the third week of testimony in the trial on a violent note. Prosecutors are trying to prove Combs led a racketeering conspiracy for 20 years that relied on beefy security employees and others to ensure he got what he wanted. Combs has pleaded not guilty.",

The attack early on Sunday came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month which have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers on Saturday, a day after each released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Further releases were expected on Sunday.",

Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 says the alarming spike began in mid-May.

Trump issued the executive order earlier this month that instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\u201d and requires that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations.",

A measure of Americans\u2019 short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market jumped 17.4 points to 72.8, but remained below 80, which can signal a recession ahead.",
