      "description": "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, has announced upgraded charges against a man accused of shooting two National Guard members. The charges are now first-degree murder after the death of Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were critically injured in Wednesday's shooting. President Donald Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died. Authorities say Rahmanullah Lakanwal drove across the country to carry out an \u201cambush-style\u201d attack. Pirro mentioned it's too soon to determine the suspect\u2019s motives.",

      "description": "The man accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington is one of about 76,000 Afghans brought to the U.S. after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. The program, called Operation Allies Welcome, was created in 2021. Then-President Joe Biden said the U.S. owed it to those who opposed the Taliban to provide a safe haven. Critics argued the resettlement process was poorly planned. The accused shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, worked with the CIA in Afghanistan. Resettlement groups emphasize that one individual's actions shouldn't reflect on all Afghan refugees.",

The death toll has risen to at least 128 people, making it one of the city's deadliest blazes. Crews prioritized apartments from which they received calls for assistance during the blaze.

Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.",
