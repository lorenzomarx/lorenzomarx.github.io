      "description": "President Donald Trump said this week that tariffs on U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico will arrive Saturday. The two nations are not only close geographically, but economically as well. The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023. That is far greater than the $643 billion in commerce that the U.S. did with China in that same year. Following are just a few imported goods that could be hit first.",

      "description": "The Trump administration has fired a group of prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 criminal cases and demanded the names of FBI agents involved in those same probes so that they can possibly be ousted. The moves that reflect a White House determination to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge the agencies of career employees seen as insufficiently loyal. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firings of the group of Jan. 6 prosecutors days after President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged in the U.S. Capitol attack. A separate memo by Bove identified more than a half-dozen FBI senior executives who were ordered to resign or be fired by Monday.",

The party is desperately seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration. The leading candidates in Saturday's election are Wisconsin\u2019s Ben Wikler and Minnesota\u2019s Ken Martin. They\u2019re little-known state party chairs who are promising to refocus on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure and improve the party\u2019s anti-Trump rapid response system. More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election. The candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes.",

He wants to use a federal definition of the sexes that excludes them, a reversal from President Joe Biden's administration policies that sought to expand legal protections. Trump has opened the door to ousting transgender service members from the military and is halting government funding for gender-affirming health care for young people. He also wants to reverse state and local policies that say students' preferred pronouns should be used in schools. Some of the orders are already facing court challenges and others are expected to.",

Hamas and Israeli officials on Friday named the hostages to be released as Yarden Bibas, 35, American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, in the fourth such exchange since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19. The inclusion of Yarden Bibas has brought renewed attention to the plight of his wife Shiri and two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were the youngest hostages to have been taken in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
