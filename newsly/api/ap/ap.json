      "description": "President Donald Trump's order imposing new tariffs on 68 countries and the European Union starting in seven days has injected a new dose of uncertainty in an already uncertain process. Trump has promised these tariffs will boost the U.S. economy and create jobs, but critics warn they could harm America's global standing and increase inflation. The legality of the tariffs is being questioned in court, with judges expressing skepticism. Major companies have warned of financial impacts, and there are concerns about rising inflation and job losses in manufacturing.",

The order Thursday by U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco affects 7,000 Nepalese whose Temporary Protected Status designations were scheduled to expire Tuesday. About 51,000 people from Honduras and nearly 3,000 from Nicaragua were scheduled to have their status terminated in September. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ended the program after determining that conditions in their home countries no longer warranted protections. The National TPS Alliance is challenging the terminations as arbitrary and racist.",
