      "description": "Americans see the federal government as rife with corruption, inefficiency and red tape \u2014 but they\u2019re less sure about whether Elon Musk is the right person to fix it. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults strongly or somewhat approve of President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk leads. The poll shows Americans aren\u2019t broadly worried about a government filled with \u201cdeep state\u201d actors poised to undermine Trump\u2019s Republican agenda. They're also ambivalent about some of the changes Trump has mentioned, including eliminating large numbers of federal jobs and moving federal agencies outside Washington.",

It's named after a slain Georgia nursing student whose name became a rallying cry during his White House campaign. If signed into law, the Laken Riley Act would require the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Under the new law, federal officials would be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes like shoplifting, assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone.",

He has covered issues from trade, immigration and U.S. foreign aid to demographic diversity, civil rights and the hiring of federal workers. Some have an immediate policy impact. Others are more symbolic. Some already are being challenged by federal lawsuits. In total, the Republican president\u2019s sweeping actions reflect many of his campaign promises and determination to concentrate executive branch power in the West Wing, while moving the country sharply rightward.",

Some lined up in Mexico\u2019s refugee offices to seek asylum in that country. Others are contemplating finding a way back home. Trump has declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and is sending U.S. troops, saying he wants to halt illegal entry and border crime.",

Mariann Budde, Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Washington, made headlines this week after she angered President Donald Trump with her sermon during an inaugural prayer service. It was not the first time the cleric has publicly disagreed with Trump, but it became a striking moment in what is usually a staid and scripted event. Budde made a direct appeal to Trump in her sermon, asking him to have mercy on members of the LGBTQ+ community and migrants who are in the country illegally. Trump later claimed Budde is a \u201cRadical Left hard line Trump hater\u201d on his Truth Social site.",

Trump has frequently blended politics and disasters, and Friday will likely be no different. He has sharply criticized President Joe Biden's administration for its handling of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and he's suggested withholding money from California unless it changes water policies. Trump will follow those stops with a Saturday victory rally in Las Vegas, where he plans to start detailing how he can begin keeping a campaign promise to exclude tips from federal taxes.",
