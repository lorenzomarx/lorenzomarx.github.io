      "description": "Stunned Palestinians rejected President Donald Trump's proposal to expel them from the Gaza Strip so that the U.S. could take over the territory and rebuild it for others. Many saw the comments as an effort to erase them from their homeland, a continuation of the \u201cNakba,\u201d or \u201cCatastrophe,\" their name for the expulsion and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from what is now Israel during the 1948 war. Palestinians displaced during the Israel-Hamas war have shown a powerful determination to return to their homes, with hundreds of thousands during the current ceasefire flooding back to neighborhoods devastated by Israeli bombardment and offensives.",

      "description": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is defending the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development and praising President Donald Trump\u2019s widely panned proposal for the United States to take control of the Gaza Strip. Rubio spoke Wednesday at a news conference in Guatemala City. He said the administration was essentially forced to shut down USAID because of \u201cinsubordination\u201d within its ranks by staffers who refused to comply with demands to justify its budget and its programs. Rubio said Trump\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. take over Gaza was in fact a \u201cvery generous\u201d offer to reconstruct and develop the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.",

The U.S. left the Geneva-based Human Rights Council last year. And it stopped funding the agency assisting Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, after Israel accused it of harboring Hamas militants who participated in the attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which UNRWA denies. Trump\u2019s announcement Tuesday came on the day he met with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country has long accused both the rights body and UNRWA of bias against Israel and antisemitism.",

Louise Hamlin\u2019s house in Altadena was privately insured, while Chris Wilson was forced onto the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program that critics dub \u201cThe Unfair Plan.\u201d Hamlin\u2019s insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors to rebuild. Wilson meanwhile faces the prospect of loans, lawsuits and may have to leave California. They\u2019re among thousands of people who lost everything in the Eaton and Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
