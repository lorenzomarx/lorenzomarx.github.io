      "description": "Three hostages held by Hamas are expected to be released Sunday after 471 days in captivity as part of a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. A gradual release of dozens of captives over the next several weeks has been agreed on. The truce and release of hostages sparked hope and trepidation among Israelis. Many fear that the three-phase deal could collapse before all the hostages return, or that they will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is more than predicted.",

      "description": "Even before the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was fully in place, Palestinians in the war-battered Gaza Strip began to return to the remains of the homes they had evacuated during the 15-month war. They trekked through the wreckage, some on foot and others hauling their belongings on donkey carts. The return of the families comes amid looming uncertainty regarding whether the ceasefire deal will bring more than a temporary halt to the fighting, who will govern the enclave and how it will be rebuilt. The United Nations has said that reconstruction could take more than 350 years if Gaza remains under an Israeli blockade.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal. The resignation of Itamar Ben-Gvir does not threaten the ceasefire, but it does weaken Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition. If other far-right lawmakers leave the government \u2014 as Ben-Gvir has encouraged them to do \u2014 the prime minister could lose his parliamentary majority, potentially forcing early elections. Ben-Gvir opposed the deal because it requires Israel to free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and to withdraw troops from Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt \u2014 and because it leaves open the possibility of Hamas staying in power in Gaza.",

      "description": "The Israel-Hamas war has devastated the Gaza Strip. Satellite photos offer some sense of the destruction in the territory. Some of the images have illustrated a likely buffer zone, wanted by Israel despite international objections. It would take some 60 square kilometers out of the enclave. In all, the strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea is about 360 square kilometers. Palestinians hope it will be part of a future state, along with the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Other images tell the story of how Palestinians\u2019 lives have changed during the war. Gaza City has been decimated, with buildings destroyed and roads filled with rubble. The images have also helped relief agencies and experts make estimates regarding the extent of the damage.",

What\u2019s now in question is whether it will be around much longer and, if so, in what form? The Chinese social video app merged in 2017 with the competing app Musical.ly, which also launched in China. That kicked off a remarkable seven years during which TikTok grew from a niche teen app into a global trendsetter, but also emerged as a potential national security threat, according to U.S. officials.",

Experts say these survivors are victims themselves. The fires that swept through the Los Angeles area this month were fast-moving and fierce and there just wasn't more they could do. But that doesn\u2019t ease the pain or the questions for the families of the more than two dozen killed, some unable to escape, others unaware of what was coming, having survived other blazes unscathed. Despite reassurances, they can't help but second-guess if they could have done more.",
