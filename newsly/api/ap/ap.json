      "description": "The Senate will try to sprint ahead on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts after a weekend of setbacks. An all-night session to consider an endless stream of proposed amendments, called a vote-a-rama, was abruptly postponed. It's now scheduled to launch when the Senate gavels open Monday. With Democrats united against the Republican president's legislation, the voting could take all day. The day ahead could be pivotal for Republicans, who are racing to meet Trump's Fourth of July deadline to pass the bill. The House is being called back to session for votes as soon as Wednesday, if the Senate can pass the bill.",

That news Sunday comes one day after he announced his opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s tax breaks and spending cuts package because of its reductions to health care programs. Tillis said in a statement that he was proud of his career in public service but acknowledged the difficult political environment for those who buck their party and go it alone. Trump, in social media posts, had berated Tillis for being one of two Republican senators who voted on Saturday night against advancing the massive bill. Tillis would have been up for a third term in 2026.",

The United States, previously a major contributor, has pulled its participation, so finding funding will be tough. The four-day Financing for Development meeting starting Monday in the southern city of Seville is taking place as many countries face escalating debt burdens, declining investments, decreasing international aid and increasing trade barriers.
