      "description": "Fire danger remains high in parts of Los Angeles that have been ablaze for days. But there is hope that better weather over the weekend will give firefighters battling the flames some relief. After calmer weather on Tuesday helped firefighters snuff out fires, a rare warning of a \u201cParticularly Dangerous Situation\u201d was issued for Wednesday in an area near the two fires that killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes. A red flag warning was issued by the National Weather Service from Central Coast to the border with Mexico from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. But forecasts suggest that conditions for firefighting will later improve, with calmer winds and more humidity expected.",

But meteorologist Todd Hall says they're possible given the extreme conditions. Fire whirl, fire devil, fire tornado or even firenado \u2014 scientists, firefighters and regular folks use multiple terms to describe similar phenomena, and they don\u2019t always agree on what\u2019s what. Some say fire whirls are formed only by heat, while fire tornadoes involve clouds generated by the fire itself. In 2018, a fire tornado the size of three football fields killed a firefighter near Redding, California. Across the country, scientists are studying the fire whirls in a lab in Massachusetts.",

Several have issued \u201cdo not drink\u201d notices to households until there is time to assess whether the water is safe. One utility official in Pasadena, which issued a \u201cdo not drink\u201d notice last week for the first time in its long history, said you have to assume the worst. Water providers are used to dealing with occasional contamination that can be boiled out. But a warmer, drier climate means wildfires are encroaching on cities, like Santa Rosa, California and Louisville, Colorado, where damaged water pipes sucked in toxic chemicals common in urban fires, and remained contaminated for months.",

The move comes nearly 35 years after the dye was barred from cosmetics such as lipsticks because of potential cancer risk. Food and Drug Administration officials on Wednesday granted a 2022 petition filed by consumer advocates. The groups argued that some studies found the dye causes cancer in laboratory rats. FDA officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or rats. Officials say the cancer risk has not been documented in people.",

The deal, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and would allow hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a devastated territory. Qatar's prime minister said the deal would go into effect on Sunday. Israel said final details still need ironing out.",
