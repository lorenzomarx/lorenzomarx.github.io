      "description": "The Justice Department says it's releasing more than 3 million pages of documents in the latest Jeffrey Epstein disclosure. The documents were disclosed Friday under a law intended to reveal what the government knew about the millionaire financier\u2019s sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with the rich and powerful. The files include some of the several million pages of records officials said were withheld from an initial release of documents in December. Hundreds of department attorneys have been reviewing files to black out material that could reveal the identities of victims. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he'll nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to be the next Fed chair. Friday's pick is likely to result in sharp changes to the powerful agency that could bring it closer to the White House and reduce its longtime independence from day-to-day politics. Warsh would replace Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump chose Powell to lead the Fed in 2017 but recently has assailed him for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. Warsh's appointment requires Senate confirmation. Warsh was on the Fed\u2019s board from 2006 to 2011. He's a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.",

Democrats struck a rare deal with President Donald Trump Thursday to separate funding for the Homeland Security Department from a broad government spending bill and fund it for two weeks while Congress debates curbs on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The deal came as irate Democrats had vowed to vote against the entire spending bill and trigger a shutdown in the wake of the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis.",
