      "description": "Job-seekers hoping to join the new Trump administration are facing a series of intense loyalty tests. And White House screening teams are fanning out to government agencies and carefully going through applicants\u2019 politics and social media posts. President Donald Trump believed the biggest mistake he made during his first term was hiring what he considered to be the wrong kinds of people. Now, aides are working to ensure the government is filled only with loyalists. Negative social media posts have been enough to derail applications. Job-seekers have been told they'll have to prove their \u201centhusiasm\u201d to implement Trump\u2019s agenda and they've been asked when their moment of \u201cMAGA revelation\u201d occurred.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has confirmed that inspectors general in various agencies have been fired. About 17 of the independent inspectors were let go. The action removes oversight in many parts of his new administration, and some members of Congress are suggesting the dismissals violate federal oversight laws. The dismissals began Friday night and were effective immediately. That's according to two people familiar with the actions who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that haven't been made public. Congress was not given the legally required 30-day notices about the removals. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he will replace the fired inspectors with \u201cgood people.\"",

He's betting that a city built on gambling and the hospitality industry will relish taking home larger slices of gratuities. Trump is vowing to make good on a campaign promise and he'll give a speech Saturday at the Circa Resort & Casino. That word comes from the Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 hospitality workers across Nevada. The union supports eliminating taxes on tips, but says Trump\u2019s proposals don\u2019t go far enough.",

      "description": "The U.S. Air Force has removed training courses for service members that included historical videos of its storied Black Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs \u2014 female World War II pilots. The step was to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s DEI ban. The videos were shown to new enlisted troops as part of the diversity courses they took in basic training. The problem may not be with the videos themselves, but that they were used in DEI coursework. The lack of clearer guidance has led the Air Force and other agencies to take a broad approach to content they are removing from training.",

That was down from an all-time high of 250,000 the same period a year earlier. Arrests fell by about half when Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders a year ago. And they plummeted by about half again when former President Joe Biden introduced severe asylum restrictions.",
