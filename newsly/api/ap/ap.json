      "description": "The Trump administration says it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world. That\u2019s according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press as well as court filings Wednesday. They detail the outcome of a 90-day review ordered by President Donald Trump of all the money provided by USAID and the State Department for development and aid work overseas. The move leaves few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court late Wednesday temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's administration says federal agencies should begin planning to eliminate employee positions. The process is known as a reduction in force. Agency leaders must submit their plans by March 13. Trump is setting the stage for what could become a dramatic realignment of the federal government. He's already downsized the workforce by laying off probationary employees. Now the administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection. Trump foreshadowed this goal in an executive order that he signed with Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who's advising the Republican president on overhauling the government.",

USAID has been one of the biggest targets so far of a broad campaign by President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, a project of Elon Musk, to slash the size of the federal government. Many USAID workers saw the administration\u2019s terms for retrieving their belongings as insulting. In the notice, the employees were instructed not to bring weapons, including firearms, \u201cspear guns\u201d and \u201chand grenades.\u201d Each worker is being given 15 minutes at their former workstation.",

      "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday. The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals whose cancellation would save $2 billion. The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 of contracts up for cancellation, and it shows the cuts would have affected everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. It underscores how the administration\u2019s approach to broad swath spending cuts have had immediate and potentially unintended consequences.",

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday the Trump Gold Card would replace EB-5 visas in two weeks. EB-5s were created by Congress in 1990 to generate foreign investment and are available to people who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people. Lutnick says the Republican president's gold card would raise the price of admission for investors and eliminate fraud. The gold card is actually a green card, or permanent legal residency.",

The country has a number of minerals critical to manufacturing including titanium, lithium and uranium. A subset of these, rare earth metals, are also important for a number of economic areas including the clean energy transition. President Donald Trump, who has pushed for the agreement, has long been critical of a transition to green energies, including wind, solar and others, along with electrification of transportation and appliances. But the minerals Ukraine possesses are needed for aerospace, medical devices, specialty glass and hundreds of other uses, making access to them a priority for the first Trump administration as well as this one.",
