      "description": "President Donald Trump says he has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on an Iran strike to give his administration more time time to push for new nuclear deal with Tehran. Trump told reporters at the White House that he told Netanyahu a strike \u201cwould be inappropriate to do right now because we\u2019re very close to a solution.\u201d Trump's comments on Wednesday came as the head of the U.N.'s atomic watchdog group said that \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on negotiations between Iran and the U.S. over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program. But Rafael Mariano Grossi described the continuing negotiations as a good sign.",

      "description": "A U.N. official says 47 Palestinians were wounded, mostly by gunfire, when crowd overran Gaza aid hub. Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. Human Rights Office for the Palestinian territories, said it appeared that Israeli army fire had caused most of the injuries. On Tuesday, crowds of Palestinians overwhelmed a new aid distribution hub set up by an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation. The crowd broke through fences and an Associated Press journalist heard Israeli tank and gun fire, and saw a military helicopter firing flares. The distribution hub outside Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah was opened the day before by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been slated by Israel to take over aid operations.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the man believed to be the head of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, Mohammed Sinwar, has been killed, apparently confirming his death in a recent strike in the Gaza Strip. There was no confirmation from Hamas. Sinwar is the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who helped mastermind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that started the Israel-Hamas war. He was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024. Israeli strikes have decimated Hamas\u2019 Gaza leadership during the 19-month war. But the militant group has maintained its rule over the parts of Gaza not seized by Israel and still holds dozens of hostages.",

The talks on Wednesday come amid an escalation in Russia\u2019s bombing campaign despite U.S.-led attempts at peace talks. Germany has been the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Zelenskyy\u2019s visit on Wednesday comes two days after Merz said his country and other major allies are no longer imposing any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine as it fights the Russian invasion. Russian forces launched an attack overnight on Ukraine using five Iskander ballistic missiles, one guided air-launched missile and 88 drones.",

This was the first such request at Combs\u2019 trial, which is in its third week of testimony in Manhattan. A defense lawyer said Wednesday that prosecutors posed questions to a Los Angeles Fire Department investigator which could imply to the jury that Combs interfered in the probe of another rapper's firebombed luxury car. After a break, the judge instructed the jury to disregard questions related to destroyed fingerprint cards. Combs has pleaded not guilty to leading a racketeering conspiracy that relied on fear and violence to get what he wanted.",

Government data show only 45 of more than 2,000 children in custody were released last month. The average child stay in federal shelters has gone up from just over one month to just over seven months. Relatives looking to get the children out of government custody as they apply for legal immigration protections say there are massive delays. DNA tests take many weeks. New requirements for proof of income and identity demand documents that many caretakers \u2014 especially those in the U.S. illegally \u2014 cannot obtain.",
