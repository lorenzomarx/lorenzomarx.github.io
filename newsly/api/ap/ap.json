The White House says Trump has agreed to \u201csay hello\u201d Wednesday to al-Sharaa before the U.S. leader wraps up his visit to Saudi Arabia and moves on to Qatar. Trump is also scheduled to attend a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the grouping of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. He then sets off Wednesday for Qatar, the second stop in his Mideast tour. Trump will be honored with a state dinner in Qatar.",

The meeting Thursday in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya comes amid a flurry of negotiations aimed at producing a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine. That includes talks in Istanbul that Rubio and President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff are to attend on Friday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday in Ankara.

The strikes came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was \u201cno way\u201d he would halt Israel\u2019s offensive in the Palestinian territory before Hamas is defeated. There had been widespread hope that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East could usher in a ceasefire deal or renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza. An Israeli blockade of the territory is now in its third month.",

The meeting also comes after the Trump administration\u2019s resettlement of 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States earlier this week.

      "description": "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago. The Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to place a new amendment on the statewide ballot that would instead impose a ban on most abortions, with exceptions for rape and incest. The vote came after the GOP majority used a rare procedural move to cut off debate by Democrats who opposed the measure. The new referendum would go before voters in November 2026 unless Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election sooner than that.",

The brothers' resentencing Tuesday for the 1989 murder of their parents, and the possibility that they'll go free, comes at time of similar cultural obsession, reflected by true-crime documentaries and docudramas. The initial trial was the first major case aired on Court TV, and came just before the O.J. Simpson trial made televised murder trials much bigger. The Menendez brothers had mostly faded from memory, but two Netflix shows brought renewed attention to their case.",
