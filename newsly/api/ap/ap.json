      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to fire one of the seven Federal Reserve governors will likely end up in court and could more clearly define the limits of the president\u2019s legal powers over the traditionally independent institution. Legal experts say Trump\u2019s claim he can fire Lisa Cook is on shaky ground. But it\u2019s an unprecedented move that hasn\u2019t played out in the courts before. The Supreme Court this year has been more willing to let the president remove agency officials than in the past. The Republican president said Monday he was removing Cook because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud. Cook was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022 and says she won't step down.",

      "description": "A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration\u2019s lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order by the chief judge that stopped the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen on Tuesday granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise would \"offend the rule of law.\u201d Cullen was nominated by President Donald Trump and serves in Virginia but was tapped to oversee the case because all of Maryland\u2019s federal judges were named as defendants. The unusual circumstance reflects the Republican administration\u2019s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies. The White House has no immediate comment.",

Trump has suggested sending federal troops to cities like Chicago and Baltimore, claiming violence is out of control. Democrats, including Pritzker, say this is a political move meant to intimidate opponents and another signal of his authoritarian takeover. They argue crime is falling and accuse Trump of ignoring cities with worse crime rates that have Republican leaders. Democrats plan to fight any intervention and use the issue to show they have real public safety solutions.",

      "description": "A rash of hoax calls about active shooters on college campuses has spread fear among students around the country as the school year begins at institutions of higher learning. The calls have prompted schools to issue campus-wide texts to \u201crun, hide, fight.\u201d They've also sent students and teachers running for cover, seeking safety in utility closets or huddling in classrooms. Officers swarmed campuses looking for the threat. In every case, the threat didn\u2019t exist. The hoax calls and false alarms have hit at least 11 college campuses from Arkansas to Pennsylvania. Security experts say that risk remains, but campus officials must find the right balance in keeping students and teachers on guard for any real threats in the future.",

He was detained Monday in Baltimore by immigration authorities after leaving a Tennessee jail on Friday. The Trump administration says he's a danger to the community, a human smuggler and a gang member. His attorneys say he's just a family man and a construction worker from El Salvador. His lawyers are fighting the deportation efforts. They say he has the right to express fear of torture in Uganda and to appeal the decisions of immigration authorities. He told the U.S. government he would prefer Costa Rica if he must be deported.",

      "description": "Utah is the latest state at the center of a national redistricting battle ahead of the 2026 midterms. A judge ordered lawmakers this week to quickly redraw the state's congressional map. That could make one of Utah\u2019s four congressional seats competitive for Democrats, who are trying to gain control of the U.S. House. The judge says the current map is unlawful because the Republican-controlled Legislature circumvented an independent redistricting commission. The ruling throws Republicans a curveball in a state where they expected a clean sweep. GOP leaders could cut their losses by creating a single left-leaning block, or gamble on creating competitive districts that Republicans will fight to keep.",

The protest Tuesday follows deadly strikes on Gaza's main hospital that killed 20 people, including medics and journalists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected meet his cabinet later on Tuesday. Relatives of hostages hope steady pressure can push the government to commit to ceasefire talks. But far-right coalition members have threatened to bolt if Israel agrees to a truce. Most hostages taken on October 7, 2023, have been released, but 50 remain in captivity in Gaza.",

Published Tuesday in the journal Psychiatric Services, the study highlights the need for improvement in chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Researchers from RAND Corporation emphasize the importance of setting benchmarks for how AI handles mental health queries. Concerns arise as more people, including children, rely on these tools for support. The study coincides with a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT contributed to a California teenager's suicide. Researchers urge companies to enhance safety measures.",
