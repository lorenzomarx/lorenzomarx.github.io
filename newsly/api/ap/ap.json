      "description": "Up all night, House Republicans voted pre-dawn to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cuts package. The House is now starting a round of debates ahead of a final vote expected later Thursday morning. GOP leaders worked almost around the clock trying to persuade skeptical holdouts. Trump worked the phones as Republicans race to send the bill to his desk by the Fourth of July deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson had recalled lawmakers to Washington, eager to seize on the momentum of the 887-page bill's passage the day before in the Senate. Some GOP lawmakers are criticizing the legislation as straying from the party's fiscal goals. Johnson expects votes later Thursday morning.",

When the Labor Department on Thursday releases job numbers for last month, they\u2019re expected to show that businesses, government agencies and nonprofits added 115,000 jobs in June, down from 139,000 in May.

So far this year employers have added an average 124,000 jobs a month, down from 168,000 in 2024 and a 2021-2023 average of 400,000.",

Two U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers\u2019 internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. The contractor who provided the videos said the bullets were fired in all directions \u2014 in the air, into the ground and at times towards the Palestinians.
