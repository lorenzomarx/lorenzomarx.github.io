      "description": "Hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians early Saturday, one of the highest tolls since an October agreement aimed at stopping the fighting. The strikes hit northern and southern Gaza, including an apartment in Gaza City and a tent in Khan Younis, officials at the Nasser and Shifa Hospitals said. The casualties included two women and six children from two different families. Israel\u2019s military did not immediately respond to questions about the strikes. The strikes came a day before a border crossing is set to open in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, a reminder that the death poll is still rising even as a ceasefire agreement inches forward.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump acted quickly to negotiate with Democratic senators on a deal to avert a government shutdown. It was a big change from his stance during last year's record-long standoff, when he refused to budge for weeks during a shutdown. Trump\u2019s urgency reflects a changed political landscape and mounting pressure on the Republican administration. Republicans are still dealing with the fallout from two recent fatal shootings by federal agent shootings in Minneapolis and from the 43-day shutdown last year. Some Republicans are frustrated by Trump's deal with Democrats and are raising the possible of a prolonged shutdown fight when the House returns Monday to vote.",

      "description": "The partial government shutdown is a lot different from the record-long shutdown in the fall. That's mostly because the shutdown that began Saturday may not last long. When the House returns on Monday, lawmakers will try to pass legislation quickly that would end the shutdown. Congress has passed half this year\u2019s funding bills, and that means several important federal agencies and programs continue to operate. Nutrition assistance programs should be unaffected. But funding is lapsing, at least temporarily, for the Pentagon and agencies such as the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation. Essential functions will continue, but workers could go without pay if the impasse drags on.",

      "description": "Nurses in Minneapolis doubted federal immigration officers' claims about a Mexican immigrant's severe injuries. ICE agents said Alberto Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n ran headfirst into a wall while handcuffed. But hospital staff found his injuries inconsistent with that account. The seemingly implausible explanation from ICE is just one example of recent encounters that have undermined the agency\u2019s credibility at Minneapolis hospitals and contributed to mounting friction between medical staff and immigration officers. Workers at the Hennepin County facility say ICE officers have restrained patients in defiance of hospital rules and stayed at their sides for days. The agents have also lingered around the campus and pressed people for proof of citizenship.",

      "description": "Emergency power cuts swept across several Ukrainian cities as well as neighboring Moldova, officials said, following a commitment from the Kremlin to U.S. President Donald Trump to pause strikes on Kyiv as Ukraine continues to battle one of its bleakest winters in years. Ukraine\u2019s Energy Minister, Denys Shmyhal, said that the outages had been caused by a technical malfunction affecting several power lines. The shortages follow weeks of Russian strikes against Ukraine\u2019s already struggling energy grid, which have already triggered long stretches of severe power shortages. Moscow has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as \u201cweaponizing winter.\u201d",

Heavy weekend snow is forecast in the Carolinas, Virginia and northeast Georgia. Parts of North Carolina could see as much as a foot.",

North Carolina was the top destination for domestic migrants in the U.S., attracting 84,000 people from other states last year. South Carolina had the highest overall growth rate at 1.5%. Florida, previously a top choice for domestic residents, fell to eighth place as more people chose to move elsewhere. Texas saw a year-to-year decrease in domestic migration, with 67,300 new domestic residents. North Carolina's appeal includes its location, job opportunities and diverse landscapes.
