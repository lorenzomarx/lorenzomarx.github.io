The first conclave ballot failed to find a winner, sending black smoke through the chapel chimney. Some cardinals expected a short conclave to replace Pope Francis, but it may take a few rounds of voting for one man to secure the two-thirds majority needed. The secretive ritual began Wednesday with Cardinal Pietro Parolin leading the proceedings. Thousands gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square to watch the event on video screens. The cardinals are sequestered from the outside world until they find a new pope.",

The GOP centrists warn fellow Republicans they won't vote for steep Medicaid cuts or rollbacks to several Biden-era green energy tax breaks. Some want to revive and bump up a deduction that allows taxpayers to write-off a portion of their state and local taxes, called SALT. It comes amid growing unease over Trump's economic policies. And it's complicating Speaker Mike Johnson's efforts to pass the bill from the House by Memorial Day.",

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from April shows the share of older Americans who are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident has risen somewhat since 2023. That shift looks very different depending on older Americans\u2019 political party. There has been a substantial decrease in confidence among older Democrats.

The conditions were on millions of dollars worth of mass transit grants for the Seattle area. They also included homelessness services grants for Boston, New York and San Francisco. The lawsuit was filed last week by eight cities and counties. It said the new conditions were designed to further President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to eliminate DEI policies and assist mass deportation efforts. The judge in Seattle wrote in her decision Wednesday that the local governments had shown they were likely to win the case.",
