      "description": "Israeli officials say Israel forces have begun withdrawing from a key Gaza corridor, part of Israel\u2019s commitments under a tenuous ceasefire deal with Hamas. The deal is moving ahead but faces a major test over whether the sides can negotiate its planned extension. Israel agreed as part of the truce to remove its forces from the 4-mile Netzarim corridor, a strip of land that bisects northern Gaza from the south. While the development Sunday signals the agreement is moving ahead, the sides appear to have made little progress on negotiating the deal\u2019s second phase, which is meant to extend the truce and lead to the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.",

      "description": "Five Thai workers released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived in Bangkok on Sunday. The five were the second batch of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were freed in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. There was no immediate information available about the last Thai hostage left in Gaza, Nattapong Pingsa, nor the two Thai workers whose bodies were taken into Gaza.",

At least one other Thai national remains in captivity, while 46 died during the conflict, according to Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Those taken hostage were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel, the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in the country. They're paid much higher wages than they can earn at home, and many opted to stay even after the attack.",

Israel views the prisoners as terrorists, while Palestinians see them as freedom fighters resisting a decadeslong military occupation. Nearly every Palestinian has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel at some point, for militant attacks or lesser offenses such as rock-throwing, protesting or membership in a banned political group. Some are held for months or years without trial.",

The sides have already carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month. In all, Hamas has agreed to release 33 Israeli hostages for nearly 2,000 prisoners and detainees during this first phase of the ceasefire. The sides still need to negotiate a second phase of the ceasefire that would be aimed at returning all remaining hostages, releasing additional prisoners and ending the war.",

South Dakota voters rejected an effort in November to update their state constitution by replacing references to \u201che\u201d with \u201cthe governor.\u201d Kristi Noem, the state's first female governor, supported a change to use gendered language. She has since joined President Donald Trump's Cabinet. Most states haven't modernized their constitutions to reflect the rise of women in politics. New York and Vermont are among the states that did decades ago. A Connecticut state senator plans to make another run at updating the constitution there during this year's legislative session.",

Latinos remain an integral part of jobs in agriculture, construction, retail and food services but these jobs are also at risk of automation, leaving some Latinos unprepared for a changing role that relies more on technology, according to a new report by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. Analysis from the UCLA Latino Policy Institute showed that Latinos are over-represented in fields at risk of automation The report also provided some suggestions suggestion on how to improve Latino economic mobility.",

The hostages\u2019 condition and scenes of Hamas forcing them to speak in the handover sparked outrage in Israel. It could increase pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend the ceasefire beyond its current six-week phase. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza does not appear to have affected the truce's current phase. But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult one.",
