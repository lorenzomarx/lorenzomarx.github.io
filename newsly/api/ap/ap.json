      "description": "A key governing partner of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it is quitting the government, leaving him with a minority in parliament. The Shas ultra-Orthodox party said Wednesday it was leaving over disagreements surrounding a proposed law meant to grant wide military draft exemptions to its constituents. A second ultra-Orthodox party quit earlier this week over the same issue. Shas said it wouldn\u2019t work to undermine the coalition once outside it and could vote with it on some laws. It also wouldn\u2019t support its collapse.",

      "description": "An American aid organization in Gaza says 20 Palestinians were killed at a distribution site in Khan Younis. The Gaza Humanitarian Fund said 19 died in a stampede, and one was fatally stabbed on Wednesday. The group accuses Hamas of spreading panic but provides no evidence. The United Nations reports 875 Palestinians have died near aid sites since May. Meanwhile, hospital officials say Israeli strikes killed 41 others, including 11 children. Israel claims its strikes target Hamas infrastructure, accusing the group of hiding among civilians. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis, with over 2 million residents struggling amid ongoing conflict and blockades.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. His public statement Wednesday came less than 24 hours after suggesting in a private meeting that he was leaning in favor of dismissing Powell. Trump confirmed to reporters that in a White House meeting Tuesday night with about a dozen House Republicans, he'd discussed the \u201cconcept\u201d of dismissing Powell. The Fed chair has long been a target because of his refusal to lower interest rates as Trump wants. Trump's team recently has accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed. Trump said Wednesday he's \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to dismiss Powell \u2014 \u201dunless he has to leave for fraud.\u201d",

      "description": "A bill to cancel about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting spending is nearing passage in the Senate. It's an action that would have a tiny impact on the nation\u2019s debt but could have major ramifications for future spending fights in Congress. The legislation would claw back nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and about $8 billion in foreign aid spending that Republicans describe as wasteful. Senate passage of the spending cuts would send the bill back to the House for final approval. Trump must sign the bill into law by midnight Friday for the cuts to take effect.",

A decision to free the Maryland construction worker could allow President Donald Trump's administration to try to deport him for a second time. A hearing to review the matter is scheduled for Wednesday in Nashville. Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint over the Republican administration\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador in March. The U.S. returned Abrego Garcia last month to face the federal smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers say the case is preposterous.",

Eswatini says it is holding the men in correctional facilities until they can be sent back to their home countries. Eswatini is one of a handful of countries in the world that are still absolute monarchies, and the only one in Africa. That means the king has absolute power over government and is not just a figurehead or a ceremonial position. The country was previously known as Swaziland but changed to Eswatini in 2018.",

U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said at a news conference Wednesday that the forged police reports would indicate that the immigrant was a victim of a crime. He said the police officials were paid $5,000 for each name they provided falsified reports for, and that there were hundreds of names. He and other officials said the case does not mean the police chiefs' departments are corrupt.",

The 54-pound rock fetched nearly $5.3 million at an auction at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday. The buyer's identity was not disclosed.

Sotheby's says it's 70% larger than the next biggest piece of Mars found on this planet. Also up for sale Wednesday was a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton that sold for $30.5 million.",
