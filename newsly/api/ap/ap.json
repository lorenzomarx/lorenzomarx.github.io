      "description": "The fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein saga is rippling through Europe. Politicians, diplomats, officials and royals have seen reputations tarnished, investigations launched and jobs lost. It comes after a trove of more than 3 million pages of Epstein-related documents revealed their ties to the U.S. financier and convicted sex offender who died behind bars in 2019. Some experts note that the reckoning in Europe\u2019s parliamentary democracies has been swifter and more severe for now than in the United States where Epstein built his empire and hobnobbed with many American elites.",

      "description": "The world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has been ordered to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East. That's according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity. It comes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers whether to take possible military action against Iran. The move, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region as Trump increases pressure on Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's amassed a collection of campaign funds exceeding $1.5 billion, an unprecedented sum for a lame-duck president. He claims to have raked in that much just between Election Day 2024 and last August, though details on the exact figure are unclear. The funds could play a huge role in influencing this November's midterms and even the 2028 race to succeed Trump. But it's also possible the mountain of cash could benefit Trump's own business interests. In the past, Trump has spent little to support political causes beyond his own \u2014 raising questions about the political funds' true purpose and potential impact on future races.",

First lady Melania Trump is joining the president on Friday's trip, and they plan to meet with military families. The base is one of the largest in the world by population. Trump was last there in June at an event meant to recognize the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. But that celebration was overshadowed by Trump's partisan remarks at the time. Since Maduro's ouster, Trump has pushed for broad oversight of the South American country\u2019s oil industry.",

      "description": "The Great Omari Mosque in Gaza City was hit by an Israeli strike during the war with Hamas. It is one of dozens of heritage sites that were damaged or destroyed during the war. With major military operations halted by a shaky ceasefire, Palestinians are gaining a clearer picture of the war's devastation, including the loss of buildings and artifacts testifying to the territory's rich history. Some repairs are underway, but full-scale restoration, and broader reconstruction of the war-ravaged territory, face major obstacles. Israel says it takes the sensitivity of heritage sites into careful account and accuses Hamas of positioning military assets beneath or near them and other civilian buildings.",

Earlier this week, the army chief said training has started even though Indonesia has no clear guidance yet. Officials now talk about sending 5,000 to 8,000 troops, focusing on engineering and medical units. Indonesia has long U.N. peacekeeping experience and has backed Gaza aid. But many at home doubt the plan, wondering who will pay the troops and how they will be used. An online petition also calls for Indonesia to reverse its decision to join Trump's Board of Peace, questioning its legitimacy.",

The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Minnesota said in a filing Thursday that newly discovered evidence in the case against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis is materially inconsistent with the allegations against them. The government\u2019s motion asked the judge for dismissal with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be resubmitted. The pending dismissal comes after a string of high-profile shootings involving federal immigration agents have seen claims made by federal officers called into question.",
