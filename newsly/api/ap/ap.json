      "description": "Pope Francis has died. He was history\u2019s first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change. He was 88. The Vatican camerlengo made the announcement Monday. Francis suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man. He was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there. From his first greeting as pope of a simple \u201cGood evening\u201d to his embrace of refugees and the downtrodden, Francis signaled a very different tone for the papacy, stressing humility over hubris for a Catholic Church beset by scandal and accusations of indifference.",

      "description": "Every pope has his critics. But Pope Francis\u2019 conservative opponents were unique in that they actually had a living alternate as a point of reference. Pope Benedict XVI lived as a pope emeritus in the Vatican Gardens for the first decade of Francis\u2019 pontificate. The unprecedented anomaly of having a reigning and retired pope living together made the dynamics of the Francis opposition a first in Catholic history. It exacerbated longstanding divisions in the church that experts say must be addressed before any other pope decides to step down. They say norms are needed to regulate a papal resignation to prevent a retired pontiff from remaining a source of inspiration for those seeking to discredit his successor.",

The Irish-born Vatican camerlengo's position will be important in the election of the next pope. Francis made his final public appearance a day earlier on Easter Sunday. Francis\u2019 death now sets off the process of allowing the faithful to pay their final respects. That will be followed by a funeral to be celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals and a conclave to elect a new pope.",

      "description": "An Irish-born American cardinal was entrusted by Pope Francis to be the camerlengo, the Vatican official who runs the Holy See after the death of one pontiff and before the election of another. Cardinal Kevin Farrell is now in the spotlight. According to tradition, the camerlengo certifies the pope\u2019s death, seals the papal apartment and breaks the pope\u2019s fisherman\u2019s ring. He leads the procession accompanying the coffin into St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and presides over the burial. He also gets written reports from Vatican offices about their current assets; a copy of the current and projected budget for the Holy See; and any other information from the Vatican\u2019s economic ministry that would be useful for cardinals and the future pope.",

Francis died Monday at age 88 following a respiratory illness.

Markets are not in full panic, but the double-digit declines in major U.S. stock indexes are testing nerves. U.S. markets had been on a two-year tear coming into 2025, though many felt stock prices had become overinflated. Trump\u2019s trade war pushed that sentiment into hyperdrive. The S&P 500 has tumbled more than 12%, and U.S. markets are being outpaced in in Europe, Asia, and just about everywhere else. Trading in traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar has become erratic and unpredictable. On Monday, the dollar struck a three-year low.",

The administration's posture is meant to hold the line against Democratic demands for Hegseth\u2019s firing at a time when the Pentagon is engulfed in turmoil, including the departures of several senior aides. The White House has framed the revelation as the outgrowth of a power struggle between Hegseth and the career workforce. But some of the recently departed officials were brought in by Hegseth.",
