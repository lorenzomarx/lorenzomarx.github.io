      "description": "Authorities say firefighters who rushed to put out a blaze in a northern Idaho mountain community found themselves instead in an unexpected shootout. A man who had intentionally set the fire to ambush the crew on Sunday was perched in a sniper position, firing at the firefighters on Canfield Mountain just north of Coeur d\u2019Alene. Authorities say they took cover behind firetrucks, but two died and a third was wounded during a barrage of gunfire over several hours. First responders made urgent calls for help. Authorities eventually found the suspect dead in the mountains. It is unknown how he died, and authorities have not yet revealed a motive.",

      "description": "The Senate will try to sprint ahead on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts after a weekend of setbacks. An all-night session to consider an endless stream of proposed amendments, called a vote-a-rama, was abruptly postponed. It's now scheduled to launch when the Senate gavels open Monday. With Democrats united against the Republican president's legislation, the voting could take all day. The day ahead could be pivotal for Republicans, who are racing to meet Trump's Fourth of July deadline to pass the bill. The House is being called back to session for votes as soon as Wednesday, if the Senate can pass the bill.",

      "description": "At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it\u2019s up to the Republican-controlled Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump\u2019s signature\u2019s domestic policy package will become law. The bill is nearing a final Senate vote. If it passes, it would then move to the House. Democrats are united against it. The bill would make permanent many of the tax breaks passed in Trump's first term while adding new ones such as no tax on tips or overtime.",

They raised concerns over what they described as \u201ccontradictory statements\u201d by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The Justice Department has said it intends to try Abrego Garcia on the smuggling charges before any moves are made to remove him from the U.S. again.

Jurors deliberated over five hours on Monday after they received instructions on the law from the trial judge.

Defense lawyers say prosecutors are unjustly basing federal crimes on what Combs did in the bedroom with his girlfriends as they participated in the swinger lifestyle and on acts of domestic violence involving their client.",
