      "description": "The Hamas-run police force said it killed 12 members of an Israeli-backed militia after detaining them early Thursday in the Gaza Strip. Hours earlier, an Israeli- and U.S.-supported aid group said Hamas attacked a bus carrying its Palestinian workers, killing at least five of them. The militia said its fighters had attacked Hamas and killed five militants. It also accused Hamas of detaining and killing humanitarian workers. It was not immediately possible to verify the competing claims or confirm the identify of those killed. The Israeli military circulated the aid group's statement on social media but did not provide its own account of what happened.",

      "description": "Protests over federal immigration enforcement raids and President Donald Trump\u2019s move to mobilize the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles are spreading nationwide and are expected to continue into the weekend. While many have been peaceful, with marchers chanting slogans and carrying signs against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, some protesters have clashed with police, leading to hundreds of arrests and the use of chemical irritants to disperse crowds. Activists say they will hold even larger demonstrations in the coming days with \u201cNo Kings\u201d events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump\u2019s planned military parade through Washington, D.C.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government survived an attempt to dissolve parliament early Thursday morning, with most of his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners voting against the bill. The ultra-Orthodox parties are furious that the government has failed to pass a law exempting their community from mandatory military service, an issue that has long divided the Jewish Israeli public, especially during the 20-month war in the Gaza Strip. Just two of the 18 ultra-Orthodox members of the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, supported the bill to dissolve. The vote was the most serious challenge to Netanyahu\u2019s government since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, the biggest security failure in Israel\u2019s history.",

Trump's appearance Wednesday marks the Republican's first time attending a performance there as president. Trump avoided the center in his first term following entertainment industry pushback over his policies. Since returning to office, Trump has replaced the Kennedy Center's president and board with loyalists, had himself named chairman and pledged to overhaul programming he calls \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology. Trump's moves have upset some patrons and performers.",

The No Kings Day of Defiance protests will happen during the military parade in Washington on Saturday for the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 which coincides with Trump\u2019s birthday.
