      "description": "Three senior Ukrainian officials say that Ukraine and the U.S. have reached an agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that would include the exploitation of rare earth minerals. The officials, who were familiar with the matter, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One of them said that Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that the country urgently needs. There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.",

      "description": "The commemoration of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine three years ago was mostly a Democratic affair at the U.S. Capitol. A press conference Monday evening held by members of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus featured just one Republican out of the 18 or so who attended. Democrats also dominated the House and Senate floor time spent on the topic. The split screen was another indication of just how much the debate over Ukraine has changed in the nation\u2019s Capitol. While some congressional Republicans still voice support for Ukraine, they aren't defying Trump\u2019s new direction, instead holding out hope that he will come around to supporting Kyiv.",

      "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to Washington seeking to convince U.S. President Donald Trump to stand by Europe\u2019s side in his talks with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine. As Macron left the White House, he called the meeting a \u201cturning point\u201d \u2014 yet Trump made no promises. Following Monday\u2019s meeting, Macron praised Trump\u2019s move toward Putin in an interview on Fox News, saying it may lead to a truce between Russia and Ukraine in the coming weeks. Macron did not come to Washington empty handed. He repeatedly said he would push to boost French and European defense spending, in response to one of Trump\u2019s most insistent demands. Trump didn\u2019t make any promises regarding Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty or Europe\u2019s security.",

The Bibas family\u2019s plight has come to embody the profound sense of loss and grief still permeating Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Israel says the boys were killed by their captors in November 2023, a month after they were abducted, while Hamas claims the family was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Their bodies were released as part of a fragile ceasefire deal. They are to be buried on Wednesday.",

They are the first international travelers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year. Experts say the latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy. The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb. 20 to Feb. 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country\u2019s special economic zone is located.",

Israel had delayed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners over what it said was the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by the militant group. The deadlock over the exchange had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend. Hamas' latest announcement on Wednesday would complete both sides\u2019 obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire.",

The vote late Tuesday evening is a crucial step toward delivering what he's called his \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts. It kickstarts a weeks-long process to draft the details and merge with the Senate. The vote was 217-215 with all Democrats opposed. But even some Republicans are uneasy. As Elon Musk is tearing through the federal government, Republicans are being hammered at town halls back home. It's a familiar GOP problem that slashing federal spending is easier said than done, as constituents rely on Medicaid and other programs and services.",
