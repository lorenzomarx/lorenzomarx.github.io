Hundreds attended vigils Sunday across the city for the victims and the Canadian prime minister visited the site on the eve of a federal election. Prosecutors have charged a 30-year-old man with eight counts of second degree murder and say more charges are possible. Investigators have ruled out terrorism and say he has a history of mental health issues. Those killed were between the ages of 5 and 65. Dozens were injured when a man driving an SUV struck people attending the Lapu Lapu Day festival on Saturday.",

It\u2019s become worse since Israel seven weeks ago cut off food, medicine and supplies for the territory\u2019s more than 2 million people. According to the United Nations Population Fund, up to 20% of Gaza\u2019s estimated 55,000 pregnant women are malnourished, and half face high-risk pregnancies. In February and March, at least 20% of newborns were born prematurely or suffering from complications or malnutrition. Comprehensive records of miscarriages and stillbirths can\u2019t be obtained. But records at one hospital show miscarriages in January and February were double the same period in 2023.",

The date for the conclave has not yet been set but it can only begin after a nine-day period of mourning. When it does, the scarlet-robed cardinals will enter solemnly to participate in a secretive process said to be guided by the holy spirit that will result in the selection of the next leader of the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic church. For inspiration they will also have the great beauty of the frescos painted by Michelangelo and other renowned Renaissance artists.",

This rite of passage is known as \"Enkipaata.\" It has been declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO but has had to adapt to modern times. The training was traditionally a year and involved. But now it's been condensed to a month time to coincide with school holidays. The latest cohort is made up of 900 teenage boys. This new generation of Maasai leaders faces unique challenges. Kenya\u2019s 1.2 million Maasai people are profoundly affected both by climate change and the shrinking of the grazing land available to them both because of urbanization and agricultural expansion.",
