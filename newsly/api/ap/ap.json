      "description": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to study how to expand access to in vitro fertilization and make it more affordable. Tuesday's signing follows up on a campaign pledge that was at odds with some members of his party. Trump also signed another executive order as well as a presidential memorandum at his Florida home and club, Mar-a-Lago. The other executive order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of Management and Budget, while the presidential memorandum called for more transparency from the government. Trump answered questions from reporters after signing the orders. His first joint TV interview with adviser Elon Musk airs later Tuesday on Fox News Channel.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving improper Social Security payments. Over the past few days, President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits. Musk called it a \u201cHUGE problem,\u201d as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste, fraud and abuse. It is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",

It was the first time the president has commented on a dispute that began with the White House blocking AP journalists from events because of its decision to continue using Gulf of Mexico, while also noting Trump has renamed the international body of water the Gulf of America. The White House has also broadened its dispute against the AP for other recommendations it has made for word usage, such as the capitalization of Black and not white in racial references.",

Kennedy Jr. told agency employees that a commission formed by President Donald Trump will investigate the childhood vaccine schedule and other issues as a way to examine the rise in chronic diseases. The announcement on Tuesday raises questions about the promise he made during his confirmation hearings to Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana physician. Cassidy harbored deep misgivings over Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy, but said Kennedy had promised not to change the nation\u2019s current vaccination schedule. Cassidy's office did not respond to a request for comment.",

The aircraft came down fast Monday, landing so hard that it lost its right wing, then burst into flames. The aircraft slid to a stop, upside down, leaving a trail of black smoke in its wake and passengers scrambling to escape the wreckage. Miraculously, all 80 people on board the flight from Minneapolis to Toronto\u2019s Pearson International Airport survived and all but two of the 21 people injured have been released from hospitals.",

They met for nearly four hours Tuesday in Saudi Arabia as President Donald Trump sought to advance his goal of ending the fighting in Ukraine and mending ties with Moscow.

However, the rapprochement may come at a cost to the transatlantic alliance of the U.S. and Europe and significantly damage Washington\u2019s standing with Ukraine as well as with other nations counting on U.S. leadership in NATO and elsewhere for their security and protection.",

The surprise acceleration in releases is apparently in return for Israel allowing long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the Gaza Strip. The six are the last living hostages set to be freed under the ceasefire\u2019s first phase. The sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase, in which Hamas says it will only release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
