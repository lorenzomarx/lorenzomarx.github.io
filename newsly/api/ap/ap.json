      "description": "TikTok arrived in the U.S. almost 6 1/2 years ago. The possibility the U.S. would outlaw the video-sharing app has kept influencers and users in anxious limbo for more than four of the years since then. Now, the moment its fans dreaded is here, but uncertainty over TikTok\u2019s future lingers. On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that bans the social media platform starting Sunday unless its China-based parent company sells to an approved buyer. An official says the Biden administration plans to leave the law\u2019s implementation to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Monday. During its short life, TikTok has been both a global cultural phenomenon and the subject of political wrangling.",

The deal is the most significant breakthrough in the war, but its implementation is complex and fragile. It requires cooperation between Palestinian militant groups, the International Red Cross, the Israeli military, mediators from multiple countries and an Israeli government whose coalition is starting to fray as hard-line ministers express their disapproval.",

The operation will be concentrated largely in the Chicago area. Arrests are expected throughout the week, subject to possible weather delays. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the operation has not been made public. Immigrants and groups advocating for them have been preparing since Trump won the presidency in November. Trump has often criticized Chicago for its protections for people in the country illegally.",

Yoon\u2019s arrest early on Sunday could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody for him, lasting months or more. The Seoul Western District Court granted law enforcement\u2019s request for an arrest warrant on Yoon following an hourslong deliberation, saying he was a threat to destroy evidence. Yoon and his lawyers on Saturday appeared before the court\u2019s judge during a hearing and argued for his release. His supporters broke into the court and rioted. Nearly 90 were arrested.",
