He has repealed dozens of former President Joe Biden\u2019s actions, begun his immigration crackdown, withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate accords and sought to keep TikTok open in the U.S., among other actions. He has pardoned hundreds of people for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He is easing regulatory burdens on oil and natural gas production, something he promises will bring down costs of all consumer goods. He is pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and has ordered a comprehensive review of foreign aid spending",

      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has used one of the flurry of executive actions that he issued on his first day back in the White House to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization for the second time in less than five years. Trump made a similar move in 2020, only to have President Joe Biden reverse it in 2021. It's an action many scientists fear could roll back decadeslong gains made in fighting infectious diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Experts have also cautioned that withdrawing from the organization could weaken the world\u2019s defenses against dangerous new outbreaks capable of triggering pandemics.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration seemed normal, but there were concerns about U.S. democracy lingering just beneath the surface. Trump himself made those apparent when he followed his speech that urged unity and optimism with one to supporters vowing to pardon Jan. 6 rioters \u2014 and then later he did just that. Trump has also promised to seek revenge against his political opponents. That pledge led to a blitz of last-minute preemptive pardons issued by outgoing President Joe Biden. The ceremony was moved inside the U.S. Capitol due to cold weather. That meant it took place in the very halls Trump supporters stormed on Jan. 6, 2021, as they acted on Trump's election lies and sought to stop Biden from taking office.",

In the streets of the capital, some Panamanians on Monday saw it as Trump\u2019s way of applying pressure on Panama for something else he wants: better control of migration through the Darien Gap. Others recalled the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama with concern. Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino responded forcefully, saying that the canal belongs to his country of 4 million and will remain Panama\u2019s territory.",
