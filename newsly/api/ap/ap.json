      "description": "A midair collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight from Kansas has killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft. That was the word from authorities Thursday as they scrutinized the actions of the military pilot after the country\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the jet late Wednesday while it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.",

      "description": "The two Russian figure skating coaches killed in the American Airlines crash were two-time Olympians and former world champions in the pairs event. They were also a married couple with a son who finished fourth last week at the U.S. national championships in Wichita, Kansas. Their son was not on the same flight. Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov won a world championship title together in pairs skating in 1994 and narrowly missed out on Olympic medals that year at the Lillehammer Games before moving to the U.S. and coaching generations of young skaters in New England. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the pair had been on board the plane.",

Those fears materialized Wednesday night when an American Airlines plane collided with a military helicopter, taking the lives of 67 people, including three soldiers and more than a dozen figure skaters. Even in peak flying conditions, experts say, the airspace around Reagan Washington National Airport can challenge the most experienced pilots, who must navigate hundreds of other commercial planes, military aircraft and restricted areas around sensitive sites.",

Trump on Thursday variously pointed the finger at the helicopter\u2019s pilot, air traffic control, his predecessor, Joe Biden, and other Democrats including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom he labeled a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Buttigieg responded by calling Trump \u201cdespicable.\u201d The cause of the crash is still unknown. Authorities are investigating and have not publicly identified the cause or said who might have been responsible for the collision of an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army helicopter.",

People and businesses are still wrestling with the economic, social and cultural aftershocks of a decision that divided the country. For businesses, Brexit has meant new red tape, costs and delays to trading with the 27 EU countries. Brexit supporters argue that short-term pain will be offset by Britain\u2019s new freedom to strike trade deals around the world, though so far they have had only a minor impact. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised to \u201creset\u201d relations with the EU after years of acrimony. But rejoining the bloc remains a distant prospect.",

Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors, the sled dogs and mushers who raced hundreds of miles to deliver its cure. It took more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to bring the life-saving serum to the community on Feb. 2, 1925. Events celebrating the serum run centennial are being celebrated throughout Alaska and elsewhere. A Maine man is even recreating the 675-mile trip with sled dogs in Alaska.",
