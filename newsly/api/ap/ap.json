      "description": "A federal judge has extended an order blocking the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to bar Harvard University from enrolling foreign students. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs granted Harvard\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking the government\u2019s action until the case is decided. It had already been paused since last week, when Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order. Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security after Secretary Kristi Noem revoked its ability to host foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced a new effort to revoke Harvard\u2019s certification to enroll foreign students.",

The nation's oldest and wealthiest school at the forefront of legal efforts to defend higher education in America from what increasingly seem like existential threats by President Donald Trump. Other schools also face the loss of federal funding and their ability to enroll international students if they don\u2019t agree to the Trump administration\u2019s changing demands. But Harvard is taking the lead on defying the White House in federal court. Trump frames his pressure as a defense against antisemitism. Sustained by a $53 billion endowment, Harvard is testing whether it can be a bulwark protecting the freedom to teach and learn nationwide.",

He\u2019s due to decide by the end of court Thursday whether to testify. If he does, it would be a remarkable chapter in the yearslong saga of the onetime Hollywood honcho-turned-#MeToo outcast. The 73-year-old is being retried on rape and sexual assault charges because New York\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction. He denies the allegations. His attorneys maintain that anything that happened between him and his accusers was consensual.",

It helps carry on the more than 180-year-old American folk singing tradition that is as much about the community as it is the music. The shape-note songbook with music notes that look like triangles, ovals, squares and diamonds is core to the a cappella group singing practice. Over time, groups of Sacred Harp singers have periodically worked together to revise the songbook, preserving its history and breathing new life into it. The book is precious to its singers. The nine-member revision committee working on the new book feels a tremendous responsibility to get it right.",
