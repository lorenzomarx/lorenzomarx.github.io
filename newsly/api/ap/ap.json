      "description": "President Donald Trump says he doubts Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin wants to end his war in Ukraine. Trump is expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon. And his comments come only a day after saying Ukraine and Russia were \u201cvery close to a deal.\u201d Trump said in a social media post Saturday as he flew back to the United States after Pope Francis\u2019 funeral that \u201cthere was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days.\u201d Trump hinted at further sanctions against Russia. Trump said, \u201cIt makes me think that maybe he doesn\u2019t want to stop the war, he\u2019s just tapping me along.\u201d",

      "description": "All Ukrainian troops have been forced from Russia\u2019s Kursk region, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Saturday. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the claim. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials said three people were killed overnight by Russian attacks across Ukraine. The attacks came hours before U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Vatican City on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis. The presidents met at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for about 15 minutes and agreed to continue negotiations later on Saturday, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nykyforov said.",

The farewell ceremony reflects his priorities as pope and wishes as pastor: Presidents and princes will be on hand, but prisoners and migrants will welcome him into the basilica. Francis choreographed the ceremony himself when he revised and simplified the Vatican\u2019s funeral rites and rituals last year. He aimed to emphasize the pope\u2019s role as a mere priest and not \u201ca powerful man of this world.\u201d Francis is breaking with recent tradition and will be buried in the St. Mary Major Basilica.",

A provincial disaster management official told Iranian state television there were injuries in Saturday's blast, without elaborating. He added that first responders were trying to reach the area while others were attempting to evacuate the site. The official said the blast came from containers at Rajaei port in the city. Social media videos showed a huge plume of black smoke. Rajaei port mainly handles container traffic and also has oil tanks and other petrochemical facilities.",

Friday's arrest escalates a clash between the Trump administration and local authorities over the president\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan is accused of escorting the man and his lawyer out of her courtroom through the jury door last week after learning that immigration authorities were seeking his arrest. The man was taken into custody outside the courthouse after agents chased him on foot. Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers says the Trump administration is using \u201cdangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level.\u201d",

The appointment Saturday of Hussein al-Sheikh as vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization does not guarantee he will be the next Palestinian president. But it makes him the front-runner among longtime politicians in the dominant Fatah party who hope to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas. Abbas hopes to play a major role in postwar Gaza. He has been under pressure from Western and Arab allies to rehabilitate the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",

Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Trump has been mostly focusing on the wrong priorities as to say he's been focusing on the right ones. The findings suggest Democrats are even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in. While about 7 in 10 Republicans say Trump has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president so far, only about half say he\u2019s emphasized the right things.",
