      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska at a U.S. military base for a crucial summit. This Friday\u2019s meeting could influence the war in Ukraine and European security. Trump aims to showcase his skills as a dealmaker. For Putin, it's a chance to negotiate terms that favor Russia. The summit excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which could undermine Ukraine's interests. Trump has expressed hopes for a broader peace deal, but success is uncertain. The meeting's outcome could have significant implications for international relations and U.S. diplomacy.",

      "description": "Days before the leaders of Russia and the U.S. hold a summit meeting in Alaska, Moscow\u2019s forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of infiltrations this week in the country\u2019s industrial heartland of Donetsk. The advances amount to only a limited success for Russia, since Moscow still needs to consolidate its gains before achieving a true breakthrough. Still, some observers say it\u2019s a potentially dangerous moment. Analyst Mykola Bieleskov says Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely try to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Kyiv by arguing the 3 1/2-year-old war is going badly for Kyiv.",

      "description": "Washington is seeking an emergency restraining order against President Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of its police department. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit Friday, after Trump Attorney General Pam Bondi named an emergency police commissioner with all the powers of the police chief. Schwalb says Trump is going beyond his legal power over the nation's capital. Schwalb wants a judge to find control of Washington police remains in district hands. The Justice Department and the White House haven't commented. The Republican president federalized the police department this week after declaring an emergency over crime in the city. Washington has historically struggled with crime but has driven violent crime rates down recently.",

The more than 2 million people in the besieged enclave faced shortages even before the war. They relied on Israeli electricity to power desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Now, displaced families reuse water for dishes and bathing. People crowd around hoses from water trucks to carry supplies home in the sweltering heat. Water and sanitation touch almost every part of the humanitarian crisis in the territory. Shortages have helped fuel the rampant spread of disease.",

The jockeying in the nation\u2019s two most populous states underscores the stakes for both parties in the narrowly divided House that could determine the fate of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda in the second half of his term.

Teams of disaster management officials, police and soldiers helped by local villagers scoured the devastated Himalayan village of Chositi on Friday.

Known as plug-in or balcony solar, the systems that are already popular in Europe could become more attractive to U.S. buyers now that residential rooftop solar credits are being scrapped under the GOP tax bill.
