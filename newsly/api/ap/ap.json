      "description": "Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry said the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will go into effect at 0630 GMT on Sunday. This will pause the fighting after 15 months of war and see the release of dozens of hostages held by the militants in the Gaza Strip and hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel\u2019s Cabinet approved the deal early on Saturday. Under the deal, 33 hostages are to be freed over the next six weeks, in exchange for more than 700 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The remaining hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first.",

      "description": "A team of doctors in Israel is preparing for the return of the hostages from Gaza with the expectation that many are likely to have severe, life-threatening complications from spending more than a year in captivity. So much about their conditions is unknown, and hospitals and experts are preparing for multiple scenarios. Some physicians say they expect the hostages to return with cardiovascular and respiratory issues due to lack of ventilation in the tunnels where many were held. They also expect to see numerous other afflictions. They range from cognitive impairment and vision problems resulting from lack of daylight to infectious diseases and broken bones.",

Landry also rescheduled a day of mourning and flag-lowering for Edward Pettifer, one of the victims of the New Orleans terror attack. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered flags at the U.S. Capitol to be raised to full height on Inauguration Day, interrupting a 30-day flag-lowering order after the death of former President Jimmy Carter last month. Other governors, mostly Republicans, have announced they will also raise flags on Inauguration Day.",

The march is expected to be about one-tenth that size of the first Women's March in 2017 and comes amid a restrained moment of reflection as many progressive voters navigate feelings of exhaustion, disappointment and despair after Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 loss in November. A goal of the organizers is to help progressive voters find their political homes in various participating organizations at the local, state and national level.",

An Associated Press review of court records found that at least 19 defendants charged with or convicted of joining the Jan. 6, 2021, riot have asked federal judges for permission to attend Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Most of them can go. Several others cannot. In most cases, Justice Department prosecutors argued that Capitol riot defendants shouldn\u2019t be allowed to return to the scene of their crimes while they\u2019re under the court\u2019s supervision.",

Republican governors have announced Trump-themed policies on immigration, crime and anti-diversity initiatives in states including Florida, Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia. Others have imitated Trump's \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d by creating their own panels aimed at shrinking state government.

Now, the moment its fans dreaded is here, but uncertainty over TikTok\u2019s future lingers.

An official says the Biden administration plans to leave the law\u2019s implementation to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Monday.
