      "description": "The Iranian state television says that Iran\u2019s underground enrichment site at Fordo has been attacked again. The report, also carried by other Iranian media, offered no word on damage, nor who launched the assault on Monday. However, Israel has been conducted airstrikes throughout the day in Iran. The United States launched a major attack Sunday on three Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordo, which required the use of sophisticated bunker-buster bombs.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is calling for the U.S. and other oil-producing economies to pump more oil as crude prices remain volatile following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The White House is also sharpening its warning to Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil and gas shipping lane, in retaliation for the U.S. carrying out strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Trump in a morning social media posting wrote, \u201cTo the Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!\u201d",

      "description": "European nations worked Monday to keep alive diplomatic efforts to curb the Israel-Iran war as the two countries traded strikes following the United States\u2019 weekend attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Calls for Tehran to enter talks with Washington appeared to fall on deaf ears. Tehran reached out to ally Russia for support instead. At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels, diplomats expressed concern about the potential for Iranian retaliation to spark a wider war and global economic instability. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged Iran to meet European officials and to open talks with the U.S. But Iran has rejected negotiations with Washington and a European official said no more talks with Iran are currently planned.",

Just a week ago, things had seemed rosy. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was optimistic for an agreement to dedicate 5% of GDP to defense spending. Then Spain rejected the new target, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d The following day, Trump said that America should not have to respect the goal. On Sunday, he ordered the bombing of nuclear installations in Iran, which could dominate the summit. Questions also remain over Ukraine\u2019s place at the meeting.",

      "description": "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth. The latest WeCount project for the Society of Family Planning finds that 1 in 4 abortions uses medications prescribed by a provider who does not see the patient in person. That is up from 1 in 20 in the months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The number may explain why another recent study found that fewer women crossed state lines for abortion in 2024 than the year before.",

The recordings shown to the jury Monday by prosecutors roughly doubled the time the jury has spent viewing the explicit footage of two of Combs' former girlfriends sexually involved with male sex workers while Combs filmed the encounters. Combs has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. Prosecutors expect to rest by Tuesday. After a defense presentation, closing arguments are expected to occur Thursday.",

They hope these hailstones will reveal secrets about storms, damage and maybe the air itself. But what do you do with nearly 4,000 melting iceballs? A lot. Researchers in the first-of-its-kind Project ICECHIP to study hail are measuring the hailstones, weighing them, slicing them, crushing them, chilling them, driving them across several states, seeing what\u2019s inside of them and in some cases \u2014 which frankly is more about fun and curiosity \u2014 eating them.",

Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, the observatory will survey the southern sky for the next 10 years. The observatory hopes to track 20 billion galaxies and discover new asteroids and other celestial objects. The effort is named after astronomer Vera Rubin, who offered the first tantalizing evidence of a mysterious force called dark matter.",
