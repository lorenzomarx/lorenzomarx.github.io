      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington. Friday's meeting is a pivotal moment for Zelenskyy's country, one that hinges on whether he can persuade the Republican to provide some form of U.S. backing for Ukraine\u2019s security against any future Russian aggression. During the visit, Ukraine is expected to sign a landmark economic agreement with the U.S. that would bind the two countries economically for years. But Zelenskyy insists on firm security guarantees to safeguard his country. There are concerns that Trump may broker a peace deal favoring Russia. But U.S. officials argue American investments in Ukraine will inherently enhance its security.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office over the war in Ukraine, accusing him of not showing gratitude after he challenged Vance on the question of diplomacy with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The argument, broadcast globally on Friday, was perhaps unique in American history. It led to the rest of Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit being canceled and called into question how much the U.S. will still support Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.",

He has talked about acquiring Greenland and its vast mineral wealth and prodding Ukraine for minerals in exchange for help fending off Russia\u2019s invasion. This week, Trump took a step toward granting the U.S. mining industry\u2019s top wishes by singling out copper as a focus of his domestic minerals policy. Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that calls for bolstering domestic U.S. copper production. While the U.S. mining industry praises Trump, groups opposed to stalled copper projects in Arizona and Minnesota say they shouldn't go ahead.",

Kim Reynolds signed the bill into law Friday, a day after the Republican-controlled House and Senate approved the measure. Reynolds has long opposed gender identity protections. Both the House and Senate approved the bill Thursday even as hundreds of opponents filled the state Capitol, chanting slogans and testifying against it. The new law removes gender identity as a protected class from Iowa\u2019s civil rights law. It also explicitly defines female and male, as well as gender.",

Joseph Czuba faced murder, attempted murder and hate crime charges in the death of Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen, in October 2023. Authorities allege that Czuba targeted them because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas. He had pleaded not guilty. The family was renting rooms from Czuba at a suburban Chicago house. Shaheen testified at the trial that he attacked her with a knife before killing her 6-year-old son in another room. Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes before handing in a verdict.",

Data released Wednesday showed that consumers slashed their spending by the most since February 2021, even as their incomes rose. On a positive note, inflation cooled, but President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose large import taxes on Canada, Mexico, and China -- the United States\u2019 top trading partners -- will likely push prices higher, economists say. Some companies are already planning to raise prices in response.",

Negotiators are seeking to iron out a second phase of the deal that could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining live hostages returning home.

The relatives of hostages still held in Gaza are ramping up pressure on Netanyahu to secure the release of their loved ones. According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead.",
