The order will allow government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in language other than English, according to a fact sheet about the impending order. The executive will rescind a mandate from former President Bill Clinton that required the government and organizations that received federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers.",

Congresswoman Grace Meng of New York called the terminations \u201cunconscionable\u201d and said, \"This action will only endanger American lives going forward.\u201d",

It\u2019s also affecting workers and communities outside the Washington, D.C. area, where about 80% of that workforce is based. Those cuts mean that members of Congress are now facing potential angst among the out-of-work federal employees in their districts across the country.

Thursday\u2019s decision grants temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration\u2019s massive trimming of the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including the Department of Defense. Lawyers for the personnel office say individual agencies made the decision to fire employees and that it had no role in ordering the firings.",

It\u2019s unclear how the layoffs will directly impact benefits of the 72.5 million beneficiaries, including retirees and children who receive retirement and disability benefits. However, advocates and Democratic lawmakers warn that layoffs will reduce the agency\u2019s ability to serve recipients in a timely manner. The layoffs are part of the Trump administration\u2019s intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, run by Trump advisor Elon Musk.",

He maintains his innocence in the deaths of two FBI agents in 1975. President Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence so he could return to the Turtle Mountain Reservation, his tribal homeland in North Dakota. He says he will spend the rest of his life fighting for Native American rights. Peltier was part of a movement in the late 1960s and 1970s that fought for Native American rights and tribal self-determination, sometimes resulting in the occupation of federal and tribal property.",

Friday's meeting is a pivotal moment for Zelenskyy's country, one that hinges on whether he can persuade the Republican to provide some form of U.S. backing for Ukraine\u2019s security against any future Russian aggression. During the visit, Ukraine is expected to sign a landmark economic agreement with the U.S. that would bind the two countries economically for years. But Zelenskyy insists on firm security guarantees to safeguard his country. There are concerns that Trump may broker a peace deal favoring Russia. But U.S. officials argue American investments in Ukraine will inherently enhance its security.",
