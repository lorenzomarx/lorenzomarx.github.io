The meeting is meant to end decades of conflict and help reopen key transportation corridors across the South Caucasus that have been shut since the early 1990s. Trump says the two leaders will participate in a peace ceremony and sign economic agreements with the U.S. that will \u201cfully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region.\u201d The Republican president on Friday will first meet with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and then will host Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev.

      "description": "The Justice Department has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James as it investigates whether she violated Trump\u2019s civil rights. That's according to people familiar with the matter on Friday. The subpoenas mark an escalation of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to scrutinize perceived adversaries of the president, including those like James who had investigated Trump before his election win last November. News of the subpoena comes as the Justice Department advances an investigation into the Trump-Russia probe that shadowed Trump for much of his first term as president and as the administration has engaged in a widespread purge from the workforce of law enforcement officials who had been involved in examining the activities of Trump and his supporters.",

The Friday decision from the appeals court based in the nation\u2019s capital reverses a finding from U.S District Judge James E. Boasberg that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. Boasberg had accused administration officials of rushing deportees out of the country under the Alien Enemies Act before they could challenge their removal in court and then willfully disregarding his order that planes already in the air should return to the United States. The Republican administration has denied violating his order.",

      "description": "Israel says it plans to take over Gaza City in another escalation of its 22-month war with Hamas. The decision, made after a late-night meeting of top officials, drew Palestinian rejection, fueled mounting international calls to end the war and provoked worries in Israel over the fate of hostages still held by Hamas. Israel\u2019s air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. Another major ground operation would almost certainly exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe. Hamas in a statement rebuffed Netanyahu\u2019s plans and vowed remain defiant.",

The order signed Thursday requires agencies to appoint individuals responsible for reviewing federal funding opportunities and grants.
