      "description": "The Senate is slogging through an overnight session as Republican leaders search for ways to secure support for President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts. For almost 18 hours the Senate has been in what's called vote-a-rama, fending off proposed amendments mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota is working to strike a last-minute agreement between Republicans worried the bill\u2019s reductions to Medicaid will leave millions without care and his conservative flank seeking steeper cuts to hold down deficits ballooning with the tax cuts. Trump urged them on in a midnight social media post.",

      "description": "Elon Musk\u2019s feud with President Donald Trump has reignited, with the tech billionaire threatening to launch a new political party and Trump suggesting Musk could be punished for his opposition. The dispute has laid bare not only the differences between the Republican president and one of his most vociferous one-time advocates, but also has reignited the possibility that the world\u2019s richest man will \u2014 along with his billions \u2014 reenter the political spending arena. Musk, Trump's former Department Of Government Efficiency chief, lashed out multiple times at Republicans for backing Trump\u2019s tax cuts bill, calling the GOP \u201cthe PORKY PIG PARTY!!\u201d for including a provision that would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $5 trillion and calling the bill \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d for Republicans.",

But weeks after Bondi\u2019s claim about \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Epstein videos, it's unclear what she was referring to. The Associated Press spoke with lawyers and law enforcement officials in criminal cases of Epstein and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell who said they hadn\u2019t seen and didn\u2019t know of recordings like what Bondi described. One of Maxwell's lawyers says salacious videos of Epstein with children never surfaced. The department has declined AP requests to speak with officials overseeing the Epstein review.",

Ukrainian officials say the plant produces drones and air defense systems. The attack Tuesday came as Ukraine prioritizes drone development to counter Russia's expanded drone attacks. Both nations are ramping up drone capabilities, turning the war into a testing ground for advanced unmanned weaponry. In June, Russia launched a record 5,438 drones at Ukraine, according to data collated by The Associated Press. Ukraine has been using long-range drones to target Russian facilities deep inside its territory. Meanwhile, Russian drones struck a large southern Ukrainian city, leaving many without power.",

Trump is heading there on Tuesday for a firsthand look at a facility the White House suggests will be especially secure given its dangerous natural surroundings. The detention center has been assembled on an isolated airstrip. It has drawn protests over the potential impact on a delicate ecosystem and for a potentially cruel message the Republican president is trying to send to immigrants.
