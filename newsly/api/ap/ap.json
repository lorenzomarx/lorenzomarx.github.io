The report offered few other details about what happened to Gen. Hossein Salami of the Guard.

      "description": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is promising to move forward with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles despite the waves of unrest. Noem spoke Thursday, hours before a judge directed the president to return control to California over National Guard troops he deployed after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals quickly put the brakes on that and temporarily blocked the judge's order, which was to go into effect on Friday. The judge\u2019s order said the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded President Donald Trump\u2019s statutory authority.",

That's according to an internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press. Trump officials have been reaching deep into communities across the country to ramp up deportations and fought for the health data on immigrants from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The dataset released this week includes the information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., which all allow immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally to enroll in relatively new Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars.",

Trump\u2019s March 25 executive order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The group of attorneys general said the directive \u201cusurps the States\u2019 constitutional power and seeks to amend election law by fiat.\u201d The White House has defended the order as \u201cstanding up for free, fair and honest elections.\" The judge say the Constitution doesn't grant the president any specific powers over elections.",

The highly divisive case has hinged on the prosecution's theory of jaded love turned deadly. That is countered by a defense claim that a cast of tight-knit Boston area law enforcement killed a fellow police officer. Read is accused of fatally striking her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow outside a house party where other local police and a federal agent were closing out a night of drinking in 2022.
