      "description": "President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members to help respond to protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids. The authorization followed mostly peaceful protests Monday. The 2,000 Guard members are an addition to the 2,100 Guard troops the president previously mobilized for the protests Sunday morning. Trump also deployed 700 Marines to help them Monday. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the deployments reckless and \u201cdisrespectful to our troops.\" Trump said Monday that the city would have been \u201ccompletely obliterated\u201d if he had not deployed the Guard.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The Republican president's trip to the North Carolina base comes as he faces criticism over deploying the National Guard and now U.S. Marines in an attempt to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday\u2019s event, along with service members, veterans and their families. Trump has promoted the Army\u2019s anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday.",

      "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief in a series of hearings beginning Tuesday. He's likely to be asked about his sharing of sensitive military details over a Signal chat. Lawmakers have made it clear they are unhappy that Hegseth has not provided details on the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget, which President Donald Trump has said would total $1 trillion. It will be members\u2019 first chance to ask about a myriad of other controversial spending by the Pentagon and the deployment of troops to quell protests in Los Angeles.",

From Seattle to Austin to Washington, D.C., marchers have chanted slogans, carried signs and snarled traffic through downtown avenues and outside federal offices. While many were peaceful, a few have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds. And activists plan even larger events in the coming days, with so-called \u201cNo Kings\u201d events across the country on Saturday to coincide with President Donald Trump\u2019s planned military parade through Washington.",

McIver has disputed the allegations as baseless.

Police bodycam video shows McIver\u2019s elbows pushing into an officer, but it isn\u2019t clear from the video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene.",

Casting a pall over the gathering is the recent death of one of the most high-profile whistleblowers in the Southern Baptists\u2019 scandal of sexual abuse. Jennifer Lyell, a onetime denominational publishing executive who went public in 2019 with allegations that she had been sexually abused by a seminary professor while a student, died Saturday at 47. Friends reported that the backlash Lyell received after going public took a devastating toll on her. Several abuse survivors and advocates for reform are skipping this year\u2019s gathering, citing lack of progress.",

The two judges who ruled against AP in a 2-1 margin last week were appointees of President Donald Trump. The full court has nine Democrats and six Republicans.",
