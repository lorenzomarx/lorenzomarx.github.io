      "description": "The Trump administration says it's eliminating 2,000 posts at the U.S. Agency for International Development and placing all but a fraction of others worldwide on leave. The notices were sent to USAID workers and viewed Sunday by The Associated Press. It comes after a federal judge allowed the administration to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas to keep his temporary stay on the government\u2019s plan in a lawsuit from employees.",

      "description": "Key federal agencies such as the FBI, State Department and Pentagon have instructed their employees not to comply with Elon Musk\u2019s latest demand that they explain what they accomplished last week or risk losing their job. The pushback from appointees of President Donald Trump marked a new level of chaos and confusion within the beleaguered federal workforce. Administration officials scrambled throughout the weekend to interpret Musk\u2019s unusual mandate. It apparently has Trump\u2019s backing despite some lawmakers arguing it is illegal. Unions want the administration to rescind the request and apologize to workers, and are threatening to sue.",

      "description": "When Bill Clinton came to Washington as president, his Democratic administration used corporate know-how and the new internet to streamline the federal bureaucracy as part of the \u201cReinventing Government\u201d push. Millions of employees were offered buyouts and there were spending cuts to balance the budget. The effort led by Vice President Al Gore ended up eliminating about 400,000 federal positions and saved an estimated $146 billion. It might sound like the controversial cost-cutting push today led by billionaire Elon Musk under the auspices of Republican President Donald Trump. But the Clinton-era initiative was authorized by legislation, took several years to identify inefficiencies and involved federal workers in re-envisioning their jobs.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s week included rewriting U.S. policy toward Russia and firing the country's senior military officer. Trump sat for a chummy interview with Elon Musk and sought greater authority over independent regulatory agencies. The Republican president acknowledged that \u201cinflation is back\u201d but said he \u201chad nothing to do\u201d with prices remaining high. That excuse can only work for so long, unless the economic outlook changes. Consumer sentiment suggests that isn\u2019t happening. As the one-month mark of his second term came and went, Trump also offered increasingly fanciful pushes, including instructing officials to check Fort Knox to ensure the gold is still there and saying Musk could send humans to Mars.",

The world\u2019s wealthiest man, who leads Tesla and Space X, was the unexpected guest of honor at the Conservative Political Action Conference. His appearance announced hours before he took the stage wielding a chainsaw. The prop, and his comments, left little subtlety about his role or his influence. His presence was felt throughout the three-day confab with thousands of his black MAGA hats being passed and put on by conservatives gathered and with speakers frequently bringing up his cost-cutting efforts.",

Zelenskyy told a forum in Kyiv on Sunday that he was open to brokering a deal that would let the U.S. profit from his country\u2019s minerals, but that the $500 billion sum initially proposed had been removed from the discussions. U.S. officials have expressed confidence that a deal could be reached this week.",
