      "description": "A federal judge in Maryland is expected to question the Trump administration about its continued refusal to retrieve a mistakenly deported Maryland man from an El Salvador prison. A hearing is scheduled for late Tuesday afternoon in a U.S. District Court. It comes a day after White House advisers repeated their claim that they lack the authority to return the Salvadoran national from his native country. The president of El Salvador also said Monday that he would not return Abrego Garcia, likening it to smuggling \u201ca terrorist into the United States.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration last week to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S.",

On the other side is the Trump administration, determined to go farther than any other White House to reshape American higher education. Both sides are digging in for a clash that could test the limits of the government\u2019s power and the independence that has made U.S. universities a destination for scholars around the world. On Monday, Harvard become the first university to openly defy the Trump administration as it demands sweeping changes to limit activism on campus.",

A temporary pause won\u2019t be enough for automakers to adjust their vast global supply chains but exemptions on parts could be key to the industry. It may also give car buyers a little more time to decide before vehicle prices are expected to rise significantly.",

      "description": "China has reported that its economy expanded at a 5.4% annual pace in January-March, supported by strong exports ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s rapid increases in tariffs on Chinese exports. Analysts are forecasting that the world\u2019s second largest economy will slow significantly in coming months, however, as tariffs as high as 145% on U.S. imports from China take effect. Exports were a strong factor in China\u2019s ability to attain a 5% annual growth rate in 2024 and the official target for this year remains at about 5%. Beijing has hit back at the U.S. with 125% tariffs on American exports, while also stressing its determination to keep its own markets open to trade and investment.",

Days after Russia targeted the city\u2019s center in back-to-back missile strikes, killing 35 people and injuring more than 100 others in the deadliest attack on Ukrainian civilians this year, life had mostly returned to its wartime normal. People hanging out in front of their apartment block Tuesday paused to look up only when hearing the buzzing of attack drones and familiar thud of Ukrainian air defenses before resuming their gossiping. The deadly attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities in recent weeks has cast a shadow over the ceasefire talks being brokered by the United States.",

The strike hit the Kuwaiti Field Hospital, in the Muwasi area, where hundreds of thousands have sought shelter in sprawling tent camps. A hospital spokesman said the wounded were all patients and medics. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has struck hospitals on several occasions during the 18-month war, accusing Hamas militants of hiding out in them or using them for military purposes. Hospital staff have denied the allegations.",

Dan Balmer says Tuesday that his 38-year-old brother, Cody Balmer, has been treated twice at a psychiatric hospital in recent years. His comments came a day after Cody Balmer told a judge he did not suffer from any mental illness. The fire left significant damage and forced Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building early Sunday during the Jewish holiday of Passover. No injuries were reported, but authorities were still working to determine a possible motive, including whether it had anything to do with Shapiro\u2019s politics or religious beliefs.",

The White House also said it will ultimately give press secretary Karoline Leavitt the final say over who gets to question her boss.",
