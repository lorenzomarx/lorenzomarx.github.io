      "description": "Israel says it plans to take over Gaza City in another escalation of its 22-month war with Hamas. The decision, made after a late-night meeting of top officials, drew Palestinian rejection, fueled mounting international calls to end the war and provoked worries in Israel over the fate of hostages still held by Hamas. Israel\u2019s air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. Another major ground operation would almost certainly exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe. Hamas in a statement rebuffed Netanyahu\u2019s plans and vowed remain defiant.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has started imposing higher import taxes on goods from over 60 countries, including the European Union, Japan and South Korea. These tariffs, which began Thursday, are part of Trump's strategy to reduce the trade deficit and encourage foreign investment in the U.S. However, the economic impact is already visible, with signs of stalled hiring, rising inflation and declining home values. Despite the uncertainty, Trump remains optimistic about economic growth, while many experts warn of potential long-term damage.",

The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to a record. Worries are high that Trump\u2019s tariffs are damaging the economy, particularly after last week\u2019s worse-than-expected report on the job market. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a torrent of stronger-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies are helping to offset the concerns, at least for now. Treasury yields ticked higher.",

      "description": "A federal judge is set to hear a Trump administration request to end a long-standing policy on protections for immigrant children in federal custody. The Flores settlement limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe conditions. Advocates argue the protections are necessary and have submitted accounts of poor conditions in detention centers. The Trump administration says conditions have improved since the settlement was formalized in 1997. But advocates for the children say the government is holding children beyond the time limits set out in the agreement. A hearing is set Friday in Los Angeles. The Trump administration request comes after the Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum requiring colleges to prove they do not consider race in admissions. This follows a Supreme Court ruling in 2023 against affirmative action. The court allowed colleges to consider how race has shaped students' lives if applicants shared that information in essays. Trump's Republican administration accuses colleges of using personal statements as proxies to consider race. The policy issued Thursday has similarities to parts of agreements with Brown and Columbia universities, which agreed to provide data on race as part of settlements to restore their federal funding. Conservatives argue colleges still consider race through proxy measures, but no clear pattern emerged in the racial makeup of last year's freshman class.",
