      "description": "President Donald Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The Republican president's trip to the North Carolina base comes as he faces criticism over deploying the National Guard and now U.S. Marines in an attempt to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday\u2019s event, along with service members, veterans and their families. Trump has promoted the Army\u2019s anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday.",

      "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief in a series of hearings beginning Tuesday. He's likely to be asked about his sharing of sensitive military details over a Signal chat. Lawmakers have made it clear they are unhappy that Hegseth has not provided details on the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget, which President Donald Trump has said would total $1 trillion. It will be members\u2019 first chance to ask about a myriad of other controversial spending by the Pentagon and the deployment of troops to quell protests in Los Angeles.",

The authorization followed mostly peaceful protests Monday. The 2,000 Guard members are an addition to the 2,100 Guard troops the president previously mobilized for the protests Sunday morning. Trump also deployed 700 Marines to help them Monday. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the deployments reckless and \u201cdisrespectful to our troops.\" Trump said Monday that the city would have been \u201ccompletely obliterated\u201d if he had not deployed the Guard.",

The attack early Tuesday struck the capital, Kyiv, and the southern port city of Odesa. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \u201cone of the biggest\u201d in the more than three-year-old war. Explosions and the buzzing of drones were heard for hours in Kyiv. The fresh Russian attacks followed Russia's biggest overnight drone bombardment of Ukraine in the three-year war. Russia has been launching a record-breaking number of drones and missiles targeting Ukraine while the two countries continue to swap prisoners of war, the only tangible outcome of direct peace talks. A ceasefire, long sought by Kyiv, remains elusive.",

The mayor says homeless people who refuse offers of shelter and treatment are often too sick from drug addiction or mental illness to know what to do. Critics of the proposal before the City Council Tuesday say criminalizing homelessness is cruel and counterproductive. The proposal is eye-opening because it comes from a liberal city headed by a Democrat in the left-leaning San Francisco Bay Area. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also has called to ban encampments.",
