      "description": "President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are starting their day by taking part in a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven economies to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump welcomed Macron to the White House on Monday at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations. The Republican meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Trump has transformed American foreign policy and effectively tuned out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war. The \u201cAmerica First\u201d president has cast a shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and ex-government officials had regarded as America\u2019s calming presence of global stability.",

      "description": "On the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on dueling resolutions. One is Ukraine\u2019s European-backed proposal demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the country. The other is a U.S. resolution for a swift end to the war that never mentions Moscow\u2019s aggression. The Monday votes are a reflection of the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. General Assembly resolutions aren't legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",

The high court turned down the appeals in orders handed down Monday, though two conservative justices disagreed. Activists argued the laws barring people from protesting or trying to dissuade women from abortions should be struck down after the justices overturned Roe v. Wade. The cities defending the laws in Illinois and New Jersey said they were passed to address disturbing behavior from protesters outside of health care clinics.",

The incident at Coeur d\u2019Alene High School on Saturday, first reported by the Coeur d\u2019Alene Press, quickly drew widespread attention after videos of the chaos were posted online. Now more than $120,000 has been raised for Teresa Borrenpohl\u2019s legal costs. Borrenpohl is a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for a legislative seat last year. She was issued a misdemeanor citation for battery after biting one of the men who tried to drag her from her seat.",
