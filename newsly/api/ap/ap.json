      "description": "Harvard University is challenging the Trump administration\u2019s decision to bar the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students. The school says that's an unconstitutional retaliation for defying the White House\u2019s political demands. Harvard filed a lawsuit Friday in federal court in Boston that says the government's action violates the First Amendment and due process clause. The school says the penalty will mean an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\u201d",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to put a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are manufactured in the United States. The threat delivered over social media could dramatically increase the price of iPhones, potentially hurting sales and the profits of one of America\u2019s leading technology companies. The company now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major companies as being in the White House\u2019s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by the import taxes being imposed by Trump.",

      "description": "House Republicans are jubilant about muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote. But across the Capitol, senators are more cautious. Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference. Republicans\u2019 aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation.",

The official said the swap was ongoing Friday morning and had not yet finished. He who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Moscow did not immediately confirm the exchange was underway. Ukraine and Russia agreed to the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side a week ago in Turkey in their first direct peace talks since the early weeks of Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of its neighbor. That meeting lasted only two hours and brought no breakthrough in international diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting.",

Thirty-one-year-old Elias Rodriguez was charged Thursday with the murder of foreign officials and other crimes in connection with the deaths of Israeli citizen Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, an American, as they left an event at a Jewish museum. The couple had plans to become engaged. Court papers said he told police after his arrest, \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza.\u201d",

Ten people were killed by strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, four in the central town of Deir al-Balah and nine in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north. Israel is facing mounting international criticism for its latest offensive and pressure to let aid into Gaza amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The strip has been under an Israeli blockade for nearly three months, according to the United Nations. Experts have warned that many of Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents are at high risk of famine.",

Among the most memorable scandals was a series of jailhouse videos showing inmates chugging Budweiser, snorting drugs and ejecting bullets from a handgun. That footage fueled a sweeping 2013 court order intended to reform one of the most violent jails in the U.S. But much of that makeover remains unfulfilled despite federal oversight and the 2015 opening of the state-of-the-art Orleans Justice Center. An independent jail monitor has warned for months of \u201cextremely inadequate\u201d staffing levels and dangerously lax supervision.",
