      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has left Qatar for the United Arab Emirates on the final leg of his Middle East tour. Trump will visit the country\u2019s largest mosque, where the country's founder is buried in a courtyard. Trump also will be hosted for a state visit by the UAE's president at a palace. Trump wrapped up his visit to Qatar by stopping at a U.S. installation Thursday, telling troops his \u201cpriority is to end conflicts.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump said he wasn't surprised Russian President Vladimir Putin will be a no-show for anticipated peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey. Earlier this week, Trump met with Syria\u2019s president and announced plans to ease sanctions on the war-torn country.",

      "description": "A hospital in southern Gaza says 54 people have been killed in overnight airstrikes on the city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press cameraman counted 10 airstrikes on the city overnight into Thursday and saw numerous bodies taken to the morgue in Nasser Hospital. Some bodies arrived in pieces, with some body bags containing the remains of multiple people. The hospital\u2019s morgue confirmed 54 people had been killed. The strikes come as U.S. President Donald Trump visits the Middle East, visiting Gulf states but not Israel. There had been hope that Trump\u2019s regional visit could usher in a ceasefire or renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza. An Israeli blockade of the territory is now in its third month.",

      "description": "Federal courts have so far uniformly blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s order seeking to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to someone in the country illegally. The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Thursday in appeals of three of those orders that prevented the Trump administration\u2019s citizenship restrictions from taking effect anywhere in the United States. At issue are the meaning of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment and the authority of judges to universally block, or enjoin, policies, rather than apply them more narrowly. Four federal judges have explained why they believe Trump\u2019s executive order is unconstitutional. Nine appellate judges also have weighed in.",

The Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to place a new amendment on the statewide ballot that would instead impose a ban on most abortions, with exceptions for rape and incest. The vote came after the GOP majority used a rare procedural move to cut off debate by Democrats who opposed the measure. The new referendum would go before voters in November 2026 unless Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election sooner than that.",

But he also has said women cannot be ordained as priests. Despite working for years in Peru, where women often lead church communities, he seems noncommittal on whether they could ever serve in any ministerial capacity. Still, the women who've worked closely with Prevost praise his leadership style, ability to listen and respect for their opinions. They tell The Associated Press that they expect him as pope to continue to promote women in church governance positions \u2014 but with limits.",
