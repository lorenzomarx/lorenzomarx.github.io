      "description": "The risk of life-threatening flooding is still high in central Texas with more rain on the way. The urgent search for the missing continues following a holiday weekend deluge that killed at least 82 people including children at summer camps. Officials say the death toll is sure to rise. Gov. Greg Abbott says more than 40 people are unaccounted for. Searchers now have found 68 bodies in Kerr County, where a wall of water came down the Guadalupe River. Sheriff Larry Leitha says the dead include 28 children. Abbott warned Sunday that additional rounds of heavy rains lasting into Tuesday could produce more flash flooding.",

      "description": "Flash floods in Texas have killed nearly 70 people, many of them children. An unknown number of people are missing. Heavy rains fell quickly in the predawn hours Friday in the Texas Hill Country, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Among the missing are 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp. Officials are resisting estimating the total number of missing. The July Fourth holiday weekend likely brought an influx of visitors to the area outside San Antonio, making it difficult to track all the people who may have been in the area.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday set a 25% tax on goods imported from Japan and South Korea, as well as new tariff rates on a dozen other countries. Trump provided notice of the tariffs to begin on Aug. 1 by posting letters on Truth Social that were addressed to the leaders of the various countries. The letters warned them to not retaliate by increasing their own import taxes, or else the Trump administration would further increase import taxes. The higher tariffs could hinder economic growth, if not increase recession risks.",

      "description": "The Israeli military says five soldiers were killed in an attack in northern Gaza, while health officials in the Palestinian territory say 18 people were killed in Israeli strikes. The bloodshed came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting the White House for talks with President Donald Trump about a ceasefire plan to pause the Gaza fighting. While there was no announcement of a breakthrough from that meeting, there were signs of progress toward a deal. The killings of the soldiers could add to the pressure on Netanyahu to strike a deal in Israel, where polls have shown widespread support for ending the war.",

On Tuesday, authorities reported an ongoing assault on the Liberian-flagged ship Eternity C, leaving two crew members injured and two missing. The attack followed a similar strike on Sunday, where the rebels sank another vessel, Magic Seas, forcing its crew to abandon ship. These incidents mark a return to Houthi aggression against shipping after a pause since March. The attacks threaten trade routes and could escalate tensions involving U.S. and Western forces in the region.",

The Pentagon announced last week that it would hold back delivering to Ukraine some air defense missiles, precision-guided artillery and other weapons as part of its announced pause to some arms shipments.

Both leaders have celebrated their joint actions, including strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, as successes. However, unresolved challenges remain, especially Israel\u2019s 21-month war with Hamas in Gaza. Trump is pushing for a ceasefire, which could lead to a halt in fighting, aid for Gaza and the release of hostages. Hamas demands an Israeli withdrawal, while Netanyahu insists on Hamas disarming. Trump also aims to revive his regional peace vision, including expanding the Abraham Accords. Ending the Gaza war could be crucial to achieving these broader goals. The two leaders are meeting Monday over a private dinner in the White House.",
