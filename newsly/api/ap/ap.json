      "description": "A president\u2019s address to Congress \u2014 even without the formal gloss of a State of the Union address \u2014 is typically a time for a call to national unity and predictable claims about the country being strong. But that wasn\u2019t President Donald Trump\u2019s plan. His speech on Tuesday night was relentlessly partisan, boasting about his election victory and criticizing Democrats for failing to recognize his accomplishments. The hard edge reflected Trump\u2019s bulldozer approach to his second term, brushing aside opposition and demanding loyalty throughout the federal government.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's one-hour and 40-minute address to Congress highlighted many of his initiatives, from an immigration crackdown to tariffs and energy policy. But many of his comments Tuesday night included false and misleading information about those efforts. Trump overstated numbers around his immigration crackdown and misrepresented economic figures, repeating several false claims he has made in the past. He also distorted an initiative from his predecessor on electric vehicles and took credit for Army recruitment trends that began before he entered office.",

Stephen Watson is a former Marine who lives in Jesup, Georgia. Watson says everyone, including veterans, needs to share in the sacrifice to bring the nation's spending under control. But former Marine Gregg Bafundo, of Tonasket, Washington, disagrees. Bafundo says President Donald Trump's cuts are only about \u201churting people and breaking things.\u201d The Republican administration's plans to cut $2 billion in VA contracts are currently on pause. That's because of concerns that critical health services for veterans would be harmed.",

Those policies generally mean that cities have limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Republicans say those policies impede the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda by protecting people who are in the country illegally and making it harder for immigration enforcement to do its job. But some cities and states say cooperating with ICE means victims and witnesses who are in the U.S. illegally won\u2019t come forward. And, to varying degrees, officials argue that they want their localities to be welcoming places for immigrants.",

In just over a month, President Donald Trump has overturned old certainties about U.S. reliability as a security partner, as he embraces Russia and withdraws American support for Ukraine. On Monday, Trump ordered a pause to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine as he sought to press President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia. That brings fresh urgency to an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday.",
