      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order denying U.S. citizenship to the children of parents living in the country illegally has faced the first of what will be many legal tests. It didn\u2019t fare well. A Justice Department lawyer had barely started making his arguments in a Seattle courtroom when U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour began blistering him with questions, calling the executive order \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d Coughenour went on to temporarily block it pending further arguments.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is poised to sign the first bill of his new administration. It's named after a slain Georgia nursing student whose name became a rallying cry during his White House campaign. If signed into law, the Laken Riley Act would require the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Under the new law, federal officials would be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes like shoplifting, assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone.",

Since the fires broke out Jan. 7, Trump has accused the state of sending too much water to the Pacific Ocean instead of south toward Los Angeles. But the federally managed Central Valley Project doesn't carry water to the nation's second most-populous city and mostly supplies farms. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California says it has ample storage to meet the region's water needs.",

The executive order Trump signed Thursday also aims to declassify the remaining federal records relating to the assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order is among a flurry of actions Trump has quickly taken as he begins a second term. Only a few thousand of the millions of governmental records related to the JFK assassination have yet to be fully declassified.",

That's according to answers he provided to a senator during his confirmation process that The Associated Press has obtained. The answers were provided to Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in response additional questions she had for Hegseth as part of the vetting process. Hegseth attorney Timothy Parlatore declined to comment on the dollar figure Thursday. Hegseth told police at the time that the encounter had been consensual and denied any wrongdoing. The news of the payment comes the same day the Senate advanced Hegseth\u2019s nomination along a party-line vote.",

Many remain determined to reach the U.S. through more dangerous means, riding freight trains, hiring smugglers and dodging authorities. Some lined up in Mexico\u2019s refugee offices to seek asylum in that country. Others are contemplating finding a way back home. Trump has declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and is sending U.S. troops, saying he wants to halt illegal entry and border crime.",

With the cameras rolling, Scharf provides running narration on what Trump is signing. Scharf was a member of Trump\u2019s legal team before joining his new administration as staff secretary.

Trump has frequently blended politics and disasters, and Friday will likely be no different. He has sharply criticized President Joe Biden's administration for its handling of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and he's suggested withholding money from California unless it changes water policies. Trump will follow those stops with a Saturday victory rally in Las Vegas, where he plans to start detailing how he can begin keeping a campaign promise to exclude tips from federal taxes.",
