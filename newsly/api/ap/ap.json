The family\u2019s latest attempts to reach the abductors failed to yield any proof that she's alive or communication with the culprits. The FBI says it's not aware of ongoing communication between the family and the suspected kidnappers. The FBI says it hasn't identified any suspects or persons of interest in the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie. Guthrie says her family in Arizona continues to believe her mother is out there and hearing everyone\u2019s prayers. By Monday evening, a purported ransom deadline apparently set by her mom\u2019s abductors appeared to have passed.",

The British prime minister was saved by a fightback and hesitation among Labour Party rivals about the consequences of a coup. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Tuesday that Labour lawmakers decided to unite behind Starmer. The crisis stems from Starmer's decision to appoint Epstein friend Peter Mandelson as U.K. ambassador to Washington. Starmer has apologized and said that Mandelson had lied about his ties to Epstein. Starmer's leadership remains shaky despite firing Mandelson. Many lawmakers are concerned about their reelection chances.",

Gaza health authorities say 586 Palestinians have been killed since the truce took effect, bringing the war\u2019s overall toll to more than 72,000. Israel says its strikes respond to ceasefire violations. Some elements of the agreement have advanced, including the return of all hostages and limited reopening of the Rafah crossing. Plans for an international stabilization force are also emerging, with Indonesia saying it is preparing thousands of troops for humanitarian and reconstruction roles, though the force\u2019s mandate remains unclear.",

The Environmental Protection Agency will issue a final rule rescinding a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding. That Obama-era policy determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Legal challenges are certain.

However, Collins has faced criticism for not condemning President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration tactics. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and oyster farmer Graham Platner are top Democratic challengers. Platner recently outraised both Mills and Collins. Collins previously defeated Democrat Sara Gideon in 2020 despite being outspent.",
