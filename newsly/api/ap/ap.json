      "description": "President Donald Trump's economic policies are facing scrutiny as weak indicators emerge. Job gains are dwindling, inflation is rising and growth has slowed compared to last year. More than six months into his term, Trump's tariffs and tax changes have reshaped the economy. On Friday, a bleak jobs report showed a decline in manufacturing jobs, and Trump fired the head of the agency responsible for the data. Critics warn that Trump's aggressive use of tariffs and tax changes could backfire. The White House, however, remains optimistic, claiming the best is yet to come.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines. This decision comes after what he calls \"highly provocative statements\" by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Trump posted on his social media site that he's taking action in case Medvedev's words are more than just rhetoric. He emphasizes the importance of words and hopes for no unintended consequences. The impact on U.S. nuclear subs, which routinely patrol global hotspots, remains unclear. This move escalates tensions between Washington and Moscow at a delicate time. Trump also mentions sending a special envoy to Russia to push for a ceasefire in its war with Ukraine.",

      "description": "Hospitals in Gaza have reported the killing of more than a dozen people, half of them food-seekers, by Israeli fire on Saturday as Palestinians endured severe risks in their search for food amid airdrops and restrictions on overland aid delivery. Eyewitnesses described chaos and gunfire at aid distribution sites, which the Israel-backed private American contractor denied. Airstrikes also killed families in tents and homes, health and hospital officials said. Meanwhile, hostage families protested in Tel Aviv, urging a deal to end the war. As border crossings remain blocked, more countries joined airdrop efforts, which UN officials say are costly and insufficient to address the crisis.",

      "description": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been a cornerstone of American culture for three generations. Now it says it will begin taking steps toward its own closure after being defunded by the U.S. Senate. That marks the end of a nearly six-decade era in which it fueled the production of renowned educational programming, cultural content and even emergency alerts. The demise of the corporation, known as CPB, is a direct result of President Donald Trump\u2019s targeting of public media, which he has repeatedly said is spreading political and cultural views antithetical to those the United States should be espousing. The closure is expected to have a profound impact on the journalistic and cultural landscape.",

      "description": "A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court\u2019s temporary order blocking the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in Southern California. A three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday night. They held a hearing Monday where the federal government asked the court to overturn a temporary restraining order issued July 12. The government argued the order was impeding their ability to enforce immigration law. Immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit last month accusing President Donald Trump\u2019s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown.",

International organizations have said for months that Gaza has been on the brink of famine, but they warned this week that the worst-case scenario of famine was beginning to unfold. Though the flow of aid resumed in May after a 10-week blockade, the amount is a fraction of what aid organizations say is needed. A security breakdown has also made it nearly impossible to safely deliver food. Much of the limited aid entering is hoarded and later sold on the black market.",
