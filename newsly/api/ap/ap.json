      "description": "An Israeli probe into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics last month in Gaza by Israeli forces says it has found \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and a deputy commander will be fired. Israel at first claimed that the medics\u2019 vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked. Cellphone video recovered from one of the medics contradicted Israel\u2019s initial account. The military investigation said Sunday that the deputy battalion commander, \u201cdue to poor night visibility,\u201d assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants.",

      "description": "The Vatican is celebrating Easter without Pope Francis presiding. The 88-year-old pontiff continues his recovery from a near-fatal bout of double pneumonia. In his place, Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the retired archpriest of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, celebrated the open-air Mass before thousands of people in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Francis has only appeared in public a handful of times since returning to the Vatican on March 23 after a 38-day hospital stay. He skipped the solemn services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday leading up to Easter. But he was expected to make an appearance on Sunday, according to the Mass booklet and liturgical plans released by the Vatican.",

      "description": "Justice Samuel Alito has written a sharp dissent that castigates the seven-member majority for blocking the Trump administration from deporting any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. The dissent was released Saturday night, hours after the court\u2019s intervention against the Republican administration. Alito says the Supreme Court acted \u201cliterally in the middle of the night\u201d and without sufficient explanation. Alito says there was \u201cdubious factual support\u201d for granting the request in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union. That group contends that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart such removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",

Thousands of federal workers fear they'll lose their jobs. Some have been let go. Many are considering early retirement or buyouts. One researcher expects the region could lose as many as 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would eliminate thousands more in other industries. Cuts to food aid programs have affected a farmers market and food pantry in a low-income neighborhood.

But President Donald Trump's new tariffs will make it many times more expensive.

That includes strollers, bottles, diaper pails and car seats The association has asked the Trump administration to exempt baby products from import taxes. Trump gave car seats and high chairs an exemption during his first administration, but it's unclear if he will do that again.",
