      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines. This decision comes after what he calls \"highly provocative statements\" by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Trump posted on his social media site that he's taking action in case Medvedev's words are more than just rhetoric. He emphasizes the importance of words and hopes for no unintended consequences. The impact on U.S. nuclear subs, which routinely patrol global hotspots, remains unclear. This move escalates tensions between Washington and Moscow at a delicate time. Trump also mentions sending a special envoy to Russia to push for a ceasefire in its war with Ukraine.",

      "description": "American businesses and consumers are finding the contours of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign trade agenda taking shape. But they don't have much more clarity on how import taxes on goods from dozens of countries will affect them. Late Thursday, Trump ordered new tariff rates for 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. Trump postponed the start date for all of the tariffs from Friday until Aug. 7. Companies are dealing with tariffs in various ways, from absorbing the tax costs themselves to raising prices. Economist say U.S. consumers are likely to foot at least part of the bill.",

      "description": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been a cornerstone of American culture for three generations. Now it says it will begin taking steps toward its own closure after being defunded by the U.S. Senate. That marks the end of a nearly six-decade era in which it fueled the production of renowned educational programming, cultural content and even emergency alerts. The demise of the corporation, known as CPB, is a direct result of President Donald Trump\u2019s targeting of public media, which he has repeatedly said is spreading political and cultural views antithetical to those the United States should be espousing. The closure is expected to have a profound impact on the journalistic and cultural landscape.",

Industry groups warned that both Swiss companies and American consumers could pay the price. Swiss officials failed to reach an agreement with the U.S. after Trump initially threatened a 31% tariff in April. The Swiss government spent Friday reeling from the news. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Switzerland was $38.5 billion last year. That's according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.",

The federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed and that not all the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was at fault. The driver had been looking for a dropped cell phone when he hit a young couple out gazing at the stars. The case could encourage other crash victims to hold out for big damages and dent confidence in self-driving technology.",
