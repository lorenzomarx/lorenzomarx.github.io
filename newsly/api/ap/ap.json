      "description": "President Joe Biden has commuted the sentence of Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents and is serving life in prison. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and wasn\u2019t eligible for parole again until 2026. He was serving life in prison for the deaths of the agents during a standoff on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Biden says Peltier will transition to home confinement. The fight for Peltier\u2019s freedom is entangled with the Indigenous rights movements. Nearly half a century later, Peltier\u2019s name remains a rallying cry.",

      "description": "It was just moments before Joe Biden's presidential term ended when he announced pardons for his siblings and their spouses. Biden said Monday his family had been \u201csubjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me.\u201d The family pardons were the surprise finale in a series of unprecedented presidential actions by the Democrat. Biden's move was designed to guard against possible retribution by Republican Donald Trump, who was sworn as president on Monday. The pardons came just before noon. Biden was already at the Capitol to see Trump inaugurated when word came out.",

Donald Trump has warned of an enemies list filled with those who\u2019ve crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his role in the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

      "description": "A large number of senior career diplomats who served in politically appointed top leadership positions at the State Department have left their posts at the demand of the incoming Trump administration, which plans to install its own people in those positions. That's according to current and outgoing U.S. officials. Personnel changes in the senior ranks of the department are not uncommon after a presidential election. And career officials serving in those roles are required to submit letters of resignation before an incoming administration takes office. In the past, some of those resignations have not been accepted, allowing career officials to remain in their posts at least temporarily until the new president can nominate his team. That offers some degree of continuity.",

The militant group has not only survived Israel\u2019s 15-month military campaign \u2014 among the deadliest and most destructive in recent memory \u2014 but it remains firmly in control of the coastal territory that now resembles an apocalyptic wasteland. For all the might it deployed in Gaza, Israel failed to remove Hamas from power, one of its central war aims. That makes a return to fighting more likely, but the results might be the same.",

      "description": "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app\u2019s savior. The developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",

Trump made mass deportations a signature issue of his campaign and has promised a raft of orders to remake immigration policy when he takes office Monday.

So-called sanctuary cities such as Chicago, which limit how local police cooperate with federal immigration authorities, have been a favorite Trump target.",
