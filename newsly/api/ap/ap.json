The government said that it would implement 15% tariff on coal and liquified natural gas products, as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and certain vehicles. \u201cThe US\u2019s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.\u201d China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation also Tuesday said it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",

      "description": "One of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances is broken. Canadians are absorbing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state. Canadians are feeling a sense of betrayal after Trump declared a trade war against America\u2019s northern neighbor and longtime ally. Trump keeps threatening Canada\u2019s sovereignty and vowing to put sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian products. The ties between the two countries are without parallel. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian, or US$2.5 billion, worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states and 77% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the United States.",

      "description": "China has announced a flurry of retaliatory measures against the U.S., including tariffs on imports of products such as coal, liquefied natural gas products and crude oil, as well as an antitrust probe into Google. It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China. Although Google services are not accessible in China, the company still maintains a presence in the country, primarily focused on sales and engineering for its advertising business. Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",

      "description": "New research shows that when an asteroid slammed into the moon billions of years ago, it carved out a pair of grand canyons on the far side. That's good news for NASA, which is looking to land astronauts at the south pole on the near, Earth-facing side later this decade. Because the debris went elsewhere, the moon's south pole contains older rocks that could be collected by moonwalkers. The incoming object created an impact basin and sent streams of rocks hurtling like missiles. Within minutes, two canyons comparable in size to Arizona's Grand Canyon were formed.",

And in North Carolina, the only place where the animals roam free, motorists are the biggest threat to their survival. For decades, conservationists have pushed for changes to U.S. 64, a busy two-lane highway that runs straight through the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. They may finally be getting their wish with federal funding that backs small underpasses to steer wolves and other animals below the highway. Wildlife crossings have surged around the world in the past two decades, but the one in North Carolina is a little different because it seeks to save a critically endangered species.",

The accord mapped out three phases of negotiations to end the 15-month war.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday. Egypt, Qatar and the United States are mediating the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas.",

Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect on the day before he returned to power last month.",
