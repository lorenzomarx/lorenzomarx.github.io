      "description": "A bill to cancel about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting spending is nearing passage in the Senate. It's an action that would have a tiny impact on the nation\u2019s debt but could have major ramifications for future spending fights in Congress. The legislation would claw back nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and about $8 billion in foreign aid spending that Republicans describe as wasteful. Senate passage of the spending cuts would send the bill back to the House for final approval. Trump must sign the bill into law by midnight Friday for the cuts to take effect.",

      "description": "Syrian government forces have started withdrawing from the southern province of Sweida following days of vicious clashes with militias from the Druze minority. Druze leaders and Syrian government officials announced a renewed ceasefire late Wednesday that was mediated by the U.S., Turkey and Arab countries. Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said in an address early Thursday that some Druze factions and clerics were appointed to maintain internal security in Sweida. Israeli strikes targeting government troops did not immediately stop. The dayslong fighting has threatened to unravel Syria\u2019s postwar political transition and brought in further military intervention by Israel.",

      "description": "Just 1 in 4 U.S. adults say President Donald Trump\u2019s policies have helped them. That's according to a new AP-NORC poll that finds underwhelming marks for the Republican president on key issues, including the economy, immigration, government spending and health care. Overall, Trump fails to earn majority approval on any of the issues included in the poll. A majority of Americans see Trump as at least somewhat capable of getting things done following the passage of his sprawling budget bill. The mixed reviews come six months into Trump's term as he struggles to follow through on some campaign promises, including lowering costs for working-class Americans, preserving programs like Medicaid and lowering government spending.",

They fear the repercussions if President Donald Trump follows through with threats to try and remove the politically independent central banker. As Trump seemingly waffled back and forth between moving to dismiss the Fed chair this week, some Republicans in Congress began to speak up to warn that such a move would be a mistake. Still, plenty of other Republicans think that dismissing Powell is a fine idea.",

      "description": "When Jeffrey Epstein died in prison, then-President Donald Trump speculated that authorities might be wrong in ruling it a suicide. Many of his allies in the pro-Trump media went further, casting Epstein's death as a murder meant to continue a decades-long coverup of pedophilia by elites. Now back in the White House, Trump has elevated prominent proponents of Epstein conspiracies to senior law enforcement roles, and they\u2019re struggling to contain a fire that they spent years stoking. Much of Trump\u2019s base is choosing to believe the president\u2019s earlier claims about Epstein over his latest contention that there\u2019s nothing of substance in government files.",
