      "description": "Fighting between Thailand and Cambodia over disputed border areas has entered a second day, leaving at least 15 dead and displacing more than 58,000 people. Clashes flared up again Friday in multiple areas, including Chong Bok and Phu Makhuea in Thailand\u2019s Ubon Ratchathani province. The Thai army accused Cambodian forces of using heavy artillery, prompting what Thai officials described as \u201cappropriate supporting fire\u201d in return. Malaysia has expressed concern and offered to mediate. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for restraint and urged both countries to resolve disputes through dialogue.",

      "description": "Serious armed clashes have erupted between Thailand and Cambodia over a disputed border area. The fighting, which erupted on Thursday, included gunfire exchanges and shelling and rocket fire, which Thai authorities say killed a Thai soldier and 13 civilians and injured 14 soldiers and 32 other civilians. Thailand has responded with air strikes. It was the second armed confrontation since a Cambodian soldier was shot dead in May. Border disputes are long-standing issues that have caused periodic tensions between the two neighbors. Thailand and Cambodia share more than 800 kilometers of land border. The contesting claims stem largely from a 1907 map drawn under French colonial rule.",

      "description": "U.S. troops are sharing command stations and vehicles with civilian immigration authorities at the southern U.S. border under an emergency declaration from President Donald Trump. A two-star general general leads 7,600 border troops and an assortment of helicopters and drones, and says the military has been freed from menial work to help apprehend immigrants, protect newly designated militarized turf and disrupt smuggling cartels. Legal experts say the strategy flouts a ban on law enforcement by the military on U.S. soil and thrusts the armed forces into a potentially politicized mission. In a twist of fate, immigrants are part of the U.S. fighting forces at the border.",

      "description": "A new poll shows Americans\u2019 views of the Supreme Court have moderated somewhat since the court\u2019s standing dropped sharply after its ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022. But the AP-NORC poll shows concern the court has too much power is rising, fueled largely by Democrats. The poll finds about a third of U.S. adults have hardly any confidence in the court, but that\u2019s down from 43% three years ago. The decrease in negative opinion about the court is driven by Republicans and independents. Still, views of the nation\u2019s highest court remain more negative than they were as recently as early 2022, before the high-profile Dobbs ruling that overturned the constitutional right to abortion.",
