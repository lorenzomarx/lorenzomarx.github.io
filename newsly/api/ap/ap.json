      "description": "President Donald Trump has signed an order to impose stiff tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, fulfilling a campaign promise but raising the prospect of trade conflict and increased prices for American consumers. Trump is declaring an economic emergency to put duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada \u2014 America\u2019s largest trading partners \u2014 except for a 10% rate on Canadian oil. The White House said Trump\u2019s order also includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if the countries retaliate against the U.S., as they have threatened. Trump says the tariffs are to force the countries to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",

      "description": "Tariffs are in the news at the moment. But what are they? Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs.",

The two nations are not only close geographically, but economically as well. The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023. That is far greater than the $643 billion in commerce that the U.S. did with China in that same year. Following are just a few imported goods that could be hit first.",

Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Chopra's tenure saw the removal of medical debt from credit reports and limits on overdrafts penalties. But many in the financial industry saw his actions as regulatory overreach. In a social media post Saturday about his departure, Chopra thanked people across the country who \u201cshared their ideas and experiences\u201d with the government\u2019s consumer financial watchdog agency.",

The dead from Friday's accident include a child who was receiving treatment at a Philadelphia hospital. All six on board the medical transport jet were from Mexico. None survived, while one person in a car was killed. Hospitals say most of the injured have been released. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy called it a \u201chigh-impact crash\u201d that left the plane \u201chighly fragmented.\u201d Officials say the impact area is blocks-long, and it could take weeks to recover the debris.",

The FCC probe is running parallel with the lawsuit, despite published reports that Trump's lawyers are engaged in potential settlement discussions with CBS News' corporate parent, Paramount.",
