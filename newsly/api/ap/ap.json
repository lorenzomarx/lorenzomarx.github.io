      "description": "Pakistani security officials say that India fired missiles across the border into Pakistani-controlled territory in at least three locations early Wednesday, killing at a child and wounding two other people. India said it was striking infrastructure used by militants. The strikes came amid soaring tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors over last month\u2019s militant attack on tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the militant attack, which Islamabad has denied. The missiles early Wednesday struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country\u2019s eastern Punjab province, according to three Pakistani security officials.",

Lawmakers in about a dozen states have advanced roughly 40 measures this year that would restrict or revamp the citizen initiative process. Many of those bills already have been signed into law. The new laws include limits on who can circulate initiative petitions and additional requirements on the content of those petitions. Several states also are proposing to raise the threshold needed for voter approval. Many of the new provisions come from Republican lawmakers in states where progressive groups have placed initiatives on the ballot.",

Officials from the Al-Aqsa Hospital said on Wednesday that the strikes included one attack on a school sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians, which killed 27 people, including nine women and three children. It was the fifth time since the war began that the school has been struck. Strikes on targets in multiple other areas killed at least 21. The Israeli military had no immediate comment Wednesday on the strikes. Israel blames Hamas for the death toll because it operates from civilian infrastructure, including schools.",
