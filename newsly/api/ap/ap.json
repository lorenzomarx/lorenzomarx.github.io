One extremist group saw it as a rallying cry for their movement. Hate watchdogs said it was unclear what Musk was trying to convey and urged caution. Musk himself was dismissive of the critics who saw it as a Nazi salute, though he didn't offer further explanation. But the confusion and plea for calm hasn\u2019t stopped critics and fans alike of the world\u2019s richest man from reading into the gesture what they wanted.",
