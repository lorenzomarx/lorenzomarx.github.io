      "description": "Iran has launched a new wave of missile attacks on Israel, triggering air raid sirens across the country as emergency services reported at least five killed and dozens more wounded in the fourth day of open warfare between the regional foes. Iran announced it had launched some 100 missiles and vowed further retaliation for Israel\u2019s surprise attack on its nuclear program and military leadership, which has killed at least 224 in the country since it began last Friday. In announcing the latest salvo after a weekend of escalating tit-for-tat attacks, Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard vowed that further rounds of strikes would be \u201cmore forceful, severe, precise and destructive than previous ones.\u201d",

      "description": "A judge has dismissed a juror in the sex trafficking trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs after concluding that his conflicting answers about where he lives might indicate he had an agenda or wanted to stay on the jury for a purpose. Judge Arun Subramanian made the ruling on Monday, rejecting arguments by Combs' attorneys that it would disrupt the diversity of the jury to replace the Black man with a white juror. Subramanian had first announced late Friday that he was dismissing the juror, but multiple defense lawyers protested. The judge delayed dismissing the juror until Monday, when the trial entered its sixth week.",

      "description": "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines. A union representative said staff at the world's most-visited museum are protesting working conditions. She said the disruption was caused by a spontaneous movement among front-of-house staff, including gallery attendants, reception, and security workers. A few months ago, President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",

Jurors began deliberations late last week, more than a month after the trial started. Read is accused of striking John O\u2019Keefe with her car outside a suburban Boston house party and leaving him to die in the snow in January 2022. She has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene. Read\u2019s lawyers say O\u2019Keefe was beaten, bitten by a dog, then left outside a home in Canton in a conspiracy orchestrated by the police that included planting evidence against Read.",

If there is a shared mission at this year\u2019s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains, it's a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions. Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There's little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.",

Many Americans are celebrating Juneteenth, that day in 1865 when a Union officer announced liberation. For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of one of history\u2019s darkest chapters with joy \u2014 such as parades or cookouts. It would take another century and a half and lots of rallying until President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2021. This year will be the first Juneteenth under the second Trump administration, which has banned DEI initiatives including Black history content.",
