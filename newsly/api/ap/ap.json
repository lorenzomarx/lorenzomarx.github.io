The holiday, also known as International Workers\u2019 Day or Labor Day, marks the struggles and achievements of workers and the labor movement around the world. Thousands of people are expected to attend rallies and marches across the U.S., including in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.

      "description": "After months of tense negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine have signed a deal that is expected to give Washington access to the country\u2019s critical minerals and other natural resources. Kyiv hopes the agreement will secure long-term support for its defense against Russia. According to Ukrainian officials, the version of the deal signed Wednesday is far more beneficial to Ukraine than previous versions. They said other versions reduced Kyiv to a junior partner and gave Washington unprecedented rights to the country\u2019s resources. The agreement must still be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament. It would establish a reconstruction fund for Ukraine that Ukrainian officials hope will be a vehicle to ensure future American military assistance.",

      "description": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to San Francisco, where she's expected to use a high-profile speech to deliver a sharp-edged critique of President Donald Trump's administration. Wednesday night's speech is being billed as Harris' most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January, after her defeat in the presidential election. Harris is expected to criticize the Republican president's economic policies and discuss America's place in global leadership. The speech comes when Harris has not ruled out a run for California governor or another try at the White House. Harris will be speaking to Emerge America, which recruits Democratic women to run for office.",

It\u2019s the second year in a row with a decrease. That reverses a troubling trend that\u2019s plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade. The officials say that while the decline is a good sign, the numbers of reported assaults are still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the report hasn\u2019t been publicly released.",

      "description": "Senate Democrats plan to force a vote in the coming weeks on a resolution to require more transparency from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration about deportations to El Salvador. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine expects to introduce the resolution Thursday. The resolution follows two previous votes on Democratic resolutions challenging Trump\u2019s tariffs. It's part of a strategy by Democrats to force votes on reversing parts of the Republican president\u2019s agenda. The resolution would force the Trump administration to report to Congress about what steps it's taking to comply with courts that have determined the U.S. government wrongfully deported immigrants like Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Most Republicans have enthusiastically embraced Trump\u2019s border policies.",

      "description": "It's easy to accumulate clutter at work. That's true in home offices and traditional workspaces alike. And those jumbles of misplaced belongings can drain our mental resources and distract us from work. Clutter can also impact our mood. As households and workplaces embark on spring cleaning, it\u2019s possible to reduce clutter and find more mental peace. First, regularly set aside time for decluttering, even if it's just 15 minutes. Set a timer. Sort items in the same category together first so you can see where there are extras. With piles of papers, think about whether you really need to hold on to each item. Reduce and get rid of duplicates. Do the same with digital files.",
