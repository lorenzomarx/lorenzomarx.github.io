      "description": "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei claimed victory over Israel on Thursday in his first public statement since a ceasefire was declared in the war between the two countries. Khamenei hasn't been seen in public since taking shelter in a secret location after the outbreak of the war June 13 when Israel attacked Iranian nuclear facilities and targeted top military commanders and scientists. In his first comment posted on X he offered his \u201ccongratulations on the victory\u201d over Israel.",

      "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s top leaders have doubled down on how destructive the U.S. attacks had been on Iran's nuclear facilities. And they described in detail the study and planning behind the bombing mission. In a rare Pentagon press briefing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine tried to shift the debate from whether the nuclear targets were \u201cobliterated,\u201d as President Donald Trump has said, and focus on what they portrayed as the heroism and extensive research and preparation that went into carrying them out. Hegseth said once more than an early assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency was preliminary.",

      "description": "Palestinian hospital officials say an Israeli airstrike has hit a street in central Gaza, killing 18 people. Witnesses say the strike targeted a crowd receiving flour from a Palestinian police unit that had confiscated goods from looters. The unit, part of Gaza\u2019s Hamas-led Interior Ministry, was distributing aid when the attack occurred. Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid, while Gaza faces ongoing turmoil over food distribution. Armed gangs and desperate crowds have disrupted aid efforts, with tribes now stepping in to guard convoys. Meanwhile, limited aid continues to trickle into Gaza, where millions struggle with hunger and violence.",

      "description": "A divided Supreme Court is allowing states to cut off Medicaid money for Planned Parenthood amid a wider Republican-backed push to defund the organization, the country\u2019s largest abortion provider. The 6-3 ruling was handed down Thursday. The case centers on funding for other health care services Planned Parenthood provides in South Carolina, but the ruling could have broader implications for Medicaid patients. South Carolina argued no public money should go to the high-profile abortion provider, even if it it\u2019s not paying for abortions. Planned Parenthood says patients go there for things like contraception and cancer screenings, in part because it can be hard to find a doctor who takes the publicly funded insurance.",

It\u2019s a blow to Republicans rushing to finish the package this week. The guidance from the parliamentarian is rarely ignored and forces GOP leaders to consider options. Republicans could try to revise it or strip it from the package. Otherwise, the provision could be challenged during floor votes. Democrats are unified against the Republican president's bill. And even GOP senators warn the tax change would hurt rural hospitals. Some Republicans call for challenging or even firing the parliamentarian, the nonpartisan chief arbiter of Senate rules.",

Both were dramatic interventions in the affairs of ally that previous U.S. administrations had insisted was a sovereign nation that made its own decisions.",
