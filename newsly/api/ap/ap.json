The talks Saturday in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Whether the two men find common ground in the high-stakes negotiations could mean success or failure in the talks. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon.",

The full scope of campus DEI rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices. But students at some schools say early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that has helped open the door to higher education.

      "description": "Some of the rioters who tried to take over the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are now considering running for office after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. At least two dozen Republican groups around the country have invited Jan. 6 rioters to speak to their members in recent months, according to an Associated Press tally. There seems to be a segment of the party's base that views those pardoned rioters not as criminals, but as patriots. One historian see a danger in that because it's \u201ca growing acceptance on the right of political violence, as long as it\u2019s done in the service of Trump\" and his false claims about the 2020 election being stolen.",
