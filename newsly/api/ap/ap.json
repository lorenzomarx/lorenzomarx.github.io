      "description": "President Donald Trump says he\u2019d like to see Arab nations increase the number of Palestinian refugees they are accepting from the Gaza Strip \u2014 potentially moving out enough of the population to \u201cclean out\u201d the area to create a virtual clean slate. He told reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday that he'd discussed his vision on a call with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with Egypt's president. Trump also said he\u2019s ended his predecessor\u2019s hold on sending 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. That lifts a pressure point meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire.",

They fear Israel would never allow them to return. Trump floated the idea on Saturday, saying he would urge the leaders of the two Arab countries to take in Gaza\u2019s now largely homeless population, so that \u201cwe just clean out that whole thing.\u201d He added that resettling Gaza\u2019s population \u201ccould be temporary or long term.\u201d",

Demonstrators attempted to enter several villages to protest Israel\u2019s failure to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw.",

      "description": "Health officials in Gaza say a Palestinian man was killed and seven people were wounded by Israeli fire overnight. They were among crowds who gathered in hopes of returning to the northern Gaza Strip under a fragile week-old ceasefire, the officials said Sunday. Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza on foot. Israel put the move on hold until Hamas freed a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been freed that day. In a separate development, President Donald Trump suggested that most of Gaza\u2019s population should be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan. Both countries and the Palestinians have previously rejected that idea.",

But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such as toxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires. The National Weather Service says most of the region is likely to get less than an inch of precipitation. But there is a threat of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills. Rain is expected to increase throughout Sunday and could last into Tuesday. Flood watches have been issued for some burn areas.",
