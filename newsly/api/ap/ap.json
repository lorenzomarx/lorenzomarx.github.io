The Associated Press spoke with 18 current and former officials who also have raised questions about Trump\u2019s past relationship with America\u2019s spies and their ability to share information at a time of heightened terror threats and signs of greater cooperation between U.S. adversaries. They say there are concerns about his nominations for key intelligence roles, including Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel, but expressed hope that America's relationships with allies are strong enough to survive any storm.",

Few details of the operation were immediately made public, including any arrests. Federal agents in Colorado detained about 50 people in an operation targeting drug trafficking by a Venezuelan hang. The sheer number of federal agencies involved showed President Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to use federal law enforcement beyond the Department of Homeland Security to carry out his long-promised mass deportations.",

      "description": "President Trump is reversing his predecessor\u2019s efforts to clean up areas hardest hit by pollution from heavy industry, ports and roadways \u2013 communities that are often largely Black, Latino and low-income. He eliminated the \u201cJustice 40\u201d initiative the Biden created which required 40% of the benefits from certain environmental programs go to hard-hit communities. He disbanded a team of White House advisors who focus on the issue. It's part of a spate of early executive orders that align with Trump's campaign pledge to slash regulations and eliminate an emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion. The new administration actions end a short-lived federal embrace of environmental justice.",

The devastation of the kibbutz of Manara, near the Lebanese border, became a symbol of the heavy price of fighting. All homes on the ridge facing nearby Lebanon are destroyed. It will be years before some homes are livable again. But no one wants to ask the difficult question: Will some residents choose not to return?
