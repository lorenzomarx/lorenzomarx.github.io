      "description": "Health officials in Gaza say Israeli strikes have killed at least 34 Palestinians. The bloodshed comes a day after Israel eased aid restrictions due to a worsening humanitarian crisis. On Sunday, Israel announced a pause in military operations in certain areas for 10 hours daily to improve aid flow. Despite these measures, Israel continues military operations outside the pause timeframe. Aid agencies welcomed the new measures but say they are insufficient. Images of emaciated children have sparked global outrage. Most of Gaza's population now relies on aid and accessing food has become increasingly dangerous.",

French officials criticize the deal as unbalanced, while Germany and Italy see it as avoiding unnecessary escalation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n calls it a failure for Europe.
