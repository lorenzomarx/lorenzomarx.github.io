      "description": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the U.S. will begin revoking the visas of Chinese students, \u201cincluding those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\u201d His announcement on X added to the uncertainty for America\u2019s international students, who have faced intensifying scrutiny from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. In a cable sent Tuesday to U.S. embassies and consulates, Rubio halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for international students until the department releases guidelines for increased vetting of their activity on social media. Existing appointments may be kept and will proceed under current review guidelines, the cable said, but new guidance is expected in the coming days.",

      "description": "A federal trade court is blocking President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. The ruling from a three-judge panel came after several lawsuits arguing Trump has exceeded his authority, left U.S. trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos. At least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s trade policy. Trump has says he has the power to act because the country\u2019s trade deficits amount to a national emergency. The court found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the use of tariffs.",

This was the first such request at Combs\u2019 trial, which is in its third week of testimony in Manhattan. A defense lawyer said Wednesday that prosecutors posed questions to a Los Angeles Fire Department investigator which could imply to the jury that Combs interfered in the probe of another rapper's firebombed luxury car. After a break, the judge instructed the jury to disregard questions related to destroyed fingerprint cards. Combs has pleaded not guilty to leading a racketeering conspiracy that relied on fear and violence to get what he wanted.",
