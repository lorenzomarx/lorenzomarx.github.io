      "description": "The House is heading towards a final vote on a bill to require the detainment of unauthorized migrants accused of theft and violent crimes. It marks the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration. The Laken Riley Act is named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man. Its passage would show just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump\u2019s election victory.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump began his second administration with a blitz of policy actions to reorient U.S. government priorities. He has covered issues from trade, immigration and U.S. foreign aid to demographic diversity, civil rights and the hiring of federal workers. Some have an immediate policy impact. Others are more symbolic. Some already are being challenged by federal lawsuits. In total, the Republican president\u2019s sweeping actions reflect many of his campaign promises and determination to concentrate executive branch power in the West Wing, while moving the country sharply rightward.",

They unwind decades-long priorities for the nation\u2019s largest employer \u2014 the federal government \u2014 and broader efforts to push the private sector to ensure its workforce is diverse and inclusive too. Trump has shown with his wide-reaching moves that he\u2019s willing to use all the levers of the government to bring about a profound cultural shift across the U.S. from promoting diversity to an exclusive focus on merit. Hours after taking the oath of office, the president signed an executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government, which he and conservatives have long condemned as discriminatory.",
