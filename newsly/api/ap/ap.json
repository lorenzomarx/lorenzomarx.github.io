      "description": "Russia's deputy foreign minister says preparations have begun for a face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Sergei Ryabkov told Russian state media on Saturday that a possible summit could involve broad talks on global issues, including the war in Ukraine. But he said efforts to bring it about are at an early stage. Last week Russian and U.S. representatives agreed to start working toward ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties, at high-level talks in Saudi Arabia that marked an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump.",

      "description": "As Ukraine approached the three-year mark of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, the country\u2019s hoped-for path to a favorable and lasting peace has been upended in a matter of days by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Kyiv had benefited from years of staunch support by its allies in the United States and Europe which had provided crucial military and financial support to help defend against Moscow\u2019s grinding incursions. But when Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week \u2014 undoing years of U.S. policy to isolate the Russian leader \u2014 it was taken as a signal in Kyiv and other European capitals that their alliance to contain Moscow was fraying.",

General Assembly that stops far short of a competing European-backed statement demanding an immediate withdrawal of all of Moscow\u2019s forces from Ukraine. Both are timed to the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which falls on Monday, when the General Assembly will vote on the nonbinding resolutions.

That's according to a person familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to comment publicly.

But the two sides made significant progress during a three-day visit to Ukraine this week by retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",

      "description": "A crash landing of a Delta Air Lines flight in Toronto has highlighted the potential dangers of flying with a young child on an adult's lap. The plane flipped over this week, which would have made holding onto a baby extremely difficult. Airline plane crashes are rare despite the recent rash of aviation disasters, but children could easily get hurt if they are on a parent's lap when a plane encounters turbulence. Experts agree it\u2019s safer for children younger than 2 years old to have their own plane seats and ride in approved car seats when flying even if families have to pay for an extra ticket. Still, it isn't required.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is moving with light speed and brute force to reshape America at home and abroad. In his first month back in office, he's performed a pirouette in foreign policy as he pulls the U.S. back from historic alliances, reaches out to Russia and chokes foreign aid. At home, he's fired thousands of federal workers and mandated an about-face in the missions of department after department. How much of this sticks will largely depend on courts, which appear to be the only check on Trump's expansive use of executive power. Congress has so far been compliant as Trump pursues his ends by edict instead of legislation.",

Doctors say it will keep him hospitalized for at least another week and regardless is still touch-and-go. In a brief early update Saturday, the Vatican said Francis slept well overnight. But doctors have warned that the main threat facing the 88-year-old Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur with pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking.",
