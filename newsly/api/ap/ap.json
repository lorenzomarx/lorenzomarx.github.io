      "description": "Texas Democrats have left the state in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. The dramatic move Sunday could expose Democrats to fines and other penalties. Democrats have cast the decision to leave the state as a last-ditch effort to stop Republicans from pushing through a rare mid-decade redrawing of the congressional map. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature that started last month to take up the redistricting effort that President Donald Trump has urged.",

      "description": "The State Department is proposing requiring applicants for business and tourist visas to post a bond of up to $15,000 to apply to enter the United States. It's a move that may make the process unaffordable for many. In a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the department says it will start a 12-month pilot program under which people from countries deemed to have high overstay rates and deficient internal document security controls could be required to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 when they apply for a visa. It says the countries affected will be listed once the program takes effect.",

      "description": "Lawmakers have left Washington for the annual August recess, but a few weeks of relative quiet at the U.S. Capitol can\u2019t mask the partisan tensions that are brewing on government funding and President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees. It could make for a momentous September. On government funding, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries sent their Republican counterparts a sharply-worded letter Monday calling for a meeting this week. They said it will take bipartisanship to avert a \u201cpainful, unnecessary shutdown.\u201d On nominees, Republicans are considering changes to Senate rules to get more of Trump\u2019s nominees confirmed.",

Israel\u2019s blockade and military offensive have made it nearly impossible to safely deliver aid.

Families of hostages in Gaza fear starvation affects them too, but blame Hamas. The U.N. says several hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since May while seeking food aid.",

The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company\u2019s CEO. In December Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.",

      "description": "Scientists have solved the mystery of what killed over 5 billion sea stars \u2014 also known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America. Starting in 2013, a wasting disease caused a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species. The sunflower sea star was worst hit, losing around 90% of its population. Researchers have identified the culprit as a bacterium that also infects shellfish. The findings, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, could help scientists intervene to save sea stars. This is crucial for Pacific ecosystems, as healthy starfish control sea urchin populations that threaten kelp forests.",
