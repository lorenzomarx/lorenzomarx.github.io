      "description": "Israeli strikes overnight and into Tuesday have killed at least 60 people across the Gaza Strip. That's according to Palestinian health officials. Israel has launched another major offensive in the territory in recent days, saying it aims to return dozens of hostages held by Hamas and destroy the militant group. The Gaza Health Ministry says two strikes in northern Gaza hit a family home and a school-turned-shelter, killing at least 22 people, more than half of them women and children. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military,",

At the same time, frustration at the slow pace of negotiations and the absence of any significant breakthrough have kept hopes low. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that \u201cit is obvious that Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war.\u201d Trump said his personal intervention was needed to push peace efforts forward, and on Monday he held separate talks over the phone with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
