      "description": "Pakistan has test-fired a ballistic missile as tensions with India spiked over last week\u2019s deadly attack on tourists in the disputed Kashmir region. The surface-to-surface missile has a range of about 280 miles, the Pakistani military said. The launch of the Abdali Weapon System on Saturday was aimed at ensuring the \u201coperational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters,\u201d including the missile\u2019s advanced navigation system and enhanced manoeuvrability features, according to a statement from the military. Pakistan\u2019s President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the scientists, engineers and those behind the successful missile test.",

      "description": "Israel has blocked aid from entering Gaza for two months and says it won\u2019t allow food, fuel, water or medicine into the besieged territory until it can prevent Hamas and other militants from siphoning it away from Palestinian civilians. But officials from the U.N. and aid groups say proposals Israel has floated to use its military to distribute vital supplies are untenable. They are problematic, these officials say, because they allow military and political objectives to impede humanitarian goals, put restrictions on who is eligible to give and receive aid, and could force large numbers of Palestinians to move \u2014 which would violate international law.",

      "description": "Four days of clashes between pro-government gunmen and members of a minority sect in Syria have left nearly 100 people dead and raised fears of deadly sectarian violence. The deeply divided country is trying to emerge from decades of dictatorship. The clashes are the worst between forces loyal to the government and Druze fighters since the fall of President Bashar Assad in early December, whose family had ruled Syria with an iron grip for more than five decades. The situation between the two sides has been tense for weeks and a smaller clash broke out in March in a suburb of Damascus.",

Both Albanese and Dutton began Saturday in the electorally-crucial city of Melbourne. Albanese returned home to Sydney and Dutton to his hometown of Brisbane to vote. Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party is seeking a second three-year term. Dutton wants to become the first opposition leader to oust a first-term government since 1931, when Australians were reeling from the Great Depression.

The People Power Party says Kim won the party ticket to run for the June 3 election during a party primary that ended Saturday. Observers say Kim will likely try to align with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to unify behind one of them in a bid to boost prospects for a conservative win against liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung. The election was arranged after conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol was removed from office in early April over his ill-fated imposition of martial law.",

Vance took a five-day trip to Europe, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland and toured Italy and India. The vice president is usually accompanied by his wife, Usha, and their three children, and he routinely mixes business with cultural excursions, pairing sometimes prickly official remarks with lighter events. Experts say such trips aren't unusual. His quick shifts between work and leisure may be emblematic of his generation.",

The Holy See released a video Saturday of the preparations for the May 7 conclave, which include installing the stove and a false floor in the frescoed Sistine Chapel to make it even. The footage also showed workers lining up simple wooden tables where the cardinals will sit and cast their votes. The preparations are all leading up to the solemn pageantry of the start of the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Francis, who died April 21 at age 88.",
