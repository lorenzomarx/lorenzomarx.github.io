      "description": "The massive military parade that President Donald Trump has long wanted is set to step off from the Lincoln Memorial with tanks, bands and thousands of troops. And the biggest question marks are whether it will be overshadowed or delayed Saturday by either the weather in Washington or planned protests elsewhere around the country. Falling on Trump\u2019s 79th birthday, the parade was added just a few weeks ago to the Army\u2019s long-planned 250th anniversary celebration. It has triggered criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. Trump so far has shrugged off concerns about the parade cost, the rainy forecast and the potential for protests.",

      "description": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is promising to move forward with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles despite the waves of unrest. Noem spoke Thursday, hours before a judge directed the president to return control to California over National Guard troops he deployed after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals quickly put the brakes on that and temporarily blocked the judge's order, which was to go into effect on Friday. The judge\u2019s order said the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded President Donald Trump\u2019s statutory authority.",

A flagship \u201cNo Kings\u201d march and rally are planned in Philadelphia. The demonstrations are gaining additional fuel from protests flaring up over federal immigration enforcement raids. Governors and city officials are vowing to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.

Planned talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which could provide an off-ramp, were called off. The region braced for a protracted conflict after Israel\u2019s surprise bombardment of Iran\u2019s nuclear and military sites on Friday killed several top generals and nuclear scientists, and neither side showed any sign of backing down. Israel reportedly targeted a gas installation, raising the prospect of a broader assault on Iran\u2019s heavily-sanctioned energy industry that could affect global markets.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s sweeping attack across Iran struck at the heart of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, delivering a blow to the country\u2019s ability to enrich uranium and potentially setting its nuclear ambitions back by months or years. As well as killing key military figures and nuclear scientists, the Israeli strikes destroyed part of a plant that was enriching uranium to levels far beyond the requirements for nuclear-fueled power stations. The attacks also destroyed backup power for the underground section of the plant, potentially damaging more sensitive equipment. Iran\u2019s nuclear program has progressed rapidly since 2018, when the U.S. withdrew from a deal to limit Tehran\u2019s capacity to enrich uranium.",
