      "description": "Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s ability to carry out President Donald Trump's \u201cplay call\u201d for funding the government is being put to the test. The House is holding a procedural vote Tuesday on a bill that would end the partial government shutdown. Johnson will need near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed. The legislation funds most of the federal government through Sept. 30 and the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks as lawmakers negotiate potential changes for the agency that enforces the nation\u2019s immigration laws, often referred to as ICE. Trump urged lawmakers to back the bill in a social media post.",

Judge Richard M. Berman cancelled the hearing late Tuesday after he was notified by Florida attorney Brittany Henderson that \u201cextensive and constructive discussions\u201d with the Justice Department had resulted in an agreement to protect victims' identities. On Sunday, Henderson and attorney Brad Edwards had sought judicial intervention, saying nearly 100 victims had been harmed by sloppy redactions to a massive release of Epstein documents that began Friday.",

It's a sign tensions have not eased since the departure of a high-profile commander. At least one person wearing an anti-ICE message was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests. There was no immediate response from the Department of Homeland Security. A federal judge ordered officers not to arrest motorists who are following but not obstructing their operations, but an appeals court set the order aside. Meanwhile, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail.",
