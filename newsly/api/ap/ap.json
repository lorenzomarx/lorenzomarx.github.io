      "description": "President Donald Trump is threatening to hold up a stadium deal for Washington's football team if it doesn't restore its old name. Trump said Sunday on his social media site that the Washington Commanders should revert to the Redskins and the Cleveland Guardians should return to the Indians. Later in the day, he threatened the NFL team's stadium deal. The Commanders and Guardians changed their names in 2022 after years of debate over logos and names considered offensive.

      "description": "Harvard University appears in federal court Monday, challenging $2.6 billion in funding cuts by the Trump administration. The university accuses the government of using funding as leverage to control its academic decisions. The cuts followed Harvard's rejection of demands from a federal antisemitism task force. The task force wanted sweeping changes to Harvard's policies on campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard, with a $53 billion endowment, has self-funded some research but warns it can't cover all losses. The Trump administration denies retaliation, stating the cuts align with its policies.",

      "description": "Families of missing loved ones face a unique and agonizing grief called ambiguous loss. Experts explain this as the pain of uncertainty when a loved one's fate is unknown, leaving families in emotional limbo. Rachel Ganz, whose husband vanished in Missouri during April floods, describes waking daily to unbearable questions about his fate. Similar anguish affects families worldwide, from Ukraine to Israel and Gaza, as they navigate loss without closure. Experts say the lack of rituals intensifies the pain. Support can come from acknowledging their struggle and offering silent presence, as words often fail to comfort in such profound uncertainty.",

The coalition fell short of the 50 seats needed to secure a majority in the 248-seat chamber. This follows their October loss in the lower house, leaving the coalition a minority in both houses for the first time since 1955. Ishiba has vowed to stay on despite mounting challenges, including economic struggles and U.S. trade tensions. Meanwhile, opposition parties, including populist groups, gained ground, reflecting voter frustration with rising prices and political instability. Calls for Ishiba to step down may intensify.",
