      "description": "Videos that emerged Wednesday show Alex Pretti was forcefully taken to the ground by federal immigration agents after kicking out the tail light of their vehicle during a Minneapolis protest 11 days before he was shot and killed by Border Patrol officers. The Jan. 13 scuffle was captured in a pair of videos that emerged Wednesday evening, showing Pretti shouting an expletive at federal immigration agents and struggling with them before he either breaks free or is let go. The new videos have rekindled the national debate about the death of Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. A Minneapolis-based attorney representing Pretti\u2019s parents says the earlier incident in no way justified the officers' use of deadly force more than a week later.",

      "description": "Officials in Mississippi say crews worked through the night to clear stranded vehicles on icy major highways as the eastern U.S. endures what could become its longest period of freezing cold in decades. Mississippi's Department of Transportation dispatched tow trucks and drones late Tuesday to frozen Interstate 55, where three tractor-trailers had stalled and caused a major backup. Gov. Tate Reeves said in social media post that highways remained dangerous Wednesday morning and urged people to stay off the roads. More than 380,000 people, mostly in Mississippi and Tennessee, remain without power days after a winter storm blasted the eastern U.S. with snow and ice. The East Coast could see more snowfall this weekend.",

      "description": "Federal Reserve officials are expected to keep their short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday after three cuts last year, ignoring huge pressure for lower borrowing costs from the White House in favor of waiting to see how the economy evolves. A key issue that Chair Jerome Powell will likely address at his news conference Wednesday is how long the Fed will remain on hold. The rate-setting committee remains split between those officials opposed to further cuts until inflation comes down, and those who want to lower rates to further support hiring. In December, just 12 of the 19 participants in the committee\u2019s meetings supported at least one more rate cut this year.",

Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings Wednesday of the current situation. Rubio said Venezuela\u2019s interim leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. He said Venezuela will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions, with the revenue set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump seemed to signal a willingness to ease tensions in Minneapolis after a second deadly shooting by federal immigration agents. But there was little evidence Wednesday of any significant changes after weeks of harsh rhetoric and clashes with protesters. Trump made a leadership change by sending his top border adviser to Minnesota to take charge of the immigration crackdown. That was followed by seemingly conciliatory remarks about the Democratic governor and mayor. But on city streets, there were few signs of a shift. Immigration enforcement operations and confrontations with activists continued in Minneapolis and St. Paul.",

Democrats are hoping to put pressure on Republicans and the White House as the country reels from the deaths of two people at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hasn't outlined what his caucus will ask for before a crucial Thursday vote on spending legislation that funds the Department of Homeland Security and a swath of other government agencies. With no evident negotiations underway, a partial shutdown seems increasingly likely starting Saturday.",
