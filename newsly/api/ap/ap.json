      "description": "The Vatican is carrying on with its Holy Year celebrations without the pope. Pope Francis remains hospitalized with pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection. Doctors say it will keep him hospitalized for at least another week and regardless is still touch-and-go. In a brief early update Saturday, the Vatican said Francis slept well overnight. But doctors have warned that the main threat facing the 88-year-old Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur with pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking.",

His possible successor a matter of intense gossip everywhere, from taxicabs to butchers' shops. Pope Francis' recent bout with pneumonia, which has landed him in the hospital for the fourth time, has fueled more speculation. This time, that's been fueled by the movie \u201cConclave,\u201d which has reminded the world about the arcane rules and spectacular drama involved in a papal election and turned viewers into armchair experts.",

He argued that Ukraine\u2019s EU accession would harm Hungary\u2019s economy and vowed to block it. Orb\u00e1n is seen as the Kremlin's closest EU partner. He has obstructed aid to Ukraine while maintaining ties with Moscow. He vowed legal action on Saturday against groups receiving U.S. aid and proposed a constitutional amendment defining gender as binary.",

But he said efforts to bring it about are at an early stage. Last week Russian and U.S. representatives agreed to start working toward ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties, at high-level talks in Saudi Arabia that marked an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is moving with light speed and brute force to reshape America at home and abroad. In his first month back in office, he's performed a pirouette in foreign policy as he pulls the U.S. back from historic alliances, reaches out to Russia and chokes foreign aid. At home, he's fired thousands of federal workers and mandated an about-face in the missions of department after department. How much of this sticks will largely depend on courts, which appear to be the only check on Trump's expansive use of executive power. Congress has so far been compliant as Trump pursues his ends by edict instead of legislation.",
