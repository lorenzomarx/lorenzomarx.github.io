      "description": "A team of doctors in Israel is preparing for the return of the hostages from Gaza with the expectation that many are likely to have severe, life-threatening complications from spending more than a year in captivity. So much about their conditions is unknown, and hospitals and experts are preparing for multiple scenarios. Some physicians say they expect the hostages to return with cardiovascular and respiratory issues due to lack of ventilation in the tunnels where many were held. They also expect to see numerous other afflictions. They range from cognitive impairment and vision problems resulting from lack of daylight to infectious diseases and broken bones.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s full Cabinet is meeting on a Gaza ceasefire deal after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed an agreement had been reached that would pause the 15-month war with Hamas and release dozens of hostages. The security Cabinet recommended the deal\u2019s approval earlier Friday. The full Cabinet was expected to approve the ceasefire, which could start as soon as Sunday. The deal has drawn fierce resistance from Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners, but their objections could destabilize his government. The Cabinet was meeting well past the beginning of the Jewish sabbath, a rare occurrence and a reflection of the moment\u2019s importance.",

      "description": "As he assumes the presidency for a second time, Donald Trump brings with him a broad expanse of business relationships and financial entanglements. Those come with the possibility that those associations could influence his decision-making in the White House. Trump has earned at least $11.6 million in royalties over the last two years from two of his books produced by Winning Team Publishing. Trump\u2019s name and image are branded on a dizzying array of merchandise. And judgments of more than half a billion dollars from civil lawsuits hang over Trump and will be difficult to avoid.",

Landry also rescheduled a day of mourning and flag-lowering for Edward Pettifer, one of the victims of the New Orleans terror attack. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered flags at the U.S. Capitol to be raised to full height on Inauguration Day, interrupting a 30-day flag-lowering order after the death of former President Jimmy Carter last month. Other governors, mostly Republicans, have announced they will also raise flags on Inauguration Day.",

The Republican president-elect says the weather forecast for Washington, D.C., with the windchill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. Trump says there's an Arctic blast sweeping the country and he doesn't want to see people hurt. The Rotunda is prepared as an alternative for each inauguration in the event of inclement weather. The swearing-in was last moved indoors in 1985, when President Ronald Reagan began his second term. Monday\u2019s forecast calls for the lowest inauguration day temperatures since that day.",

The court held Friday the risk to national security posed by TikTok's ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the U.S. A sale does not appear imminent. The court\u2019s decision means new users won\u2019t be able to download the app and updates won\u2019t be available, but it won\u2019t disappear from users\u2019 phones. Trump had called on the court to keep the ban on hold until after he takes office Monday.",

The conversation comes ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday. The U.S.-China relationship is expected to be one of the main focuses of Trump\u2019s second term, with tensions between the two superpowers looming in the areas of trade, technology and the self-ruled island of Taiwan, among other things. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% on all Chinese imports into the U.S. But he has also in the past praised his relationship with Xi and has suggested China could help mediate international crises such as the war in Ukraine.",

But the most significant diplomatic breakthrough in over a year of brutal war between Israel and Hamas is rife with risks, and seems to raise more questions than it answers. The deal presented Friday to the Israeli Cabinet after months of negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar appears ridden with diplomatic ambiguity. It leaves the issues that most inflame tensions between Israel and Hamas up for further negotiation. That is stirring fears that, failing a second agreement, the war could resume within weeks.",

Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser were jailed on Friday from 3 1/2 to five years. They were arrested in October 2023 on charges of involvement with extremist groups, as Navalny\u2019s networks were deemed by authorities. The case was widely seen as a way to increase pressure on the opposition to discourage defense lawyers from taking political cases. At the time, Navalny was serving a 19-year sentence on several criminal convictions, including extremism. He died last year in a penal colony.",

The bill would also give states new power to legally challenge federal immigration policies.

It's named after a Georgia student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man and may become the first bill Trump signs as president in his second term.
