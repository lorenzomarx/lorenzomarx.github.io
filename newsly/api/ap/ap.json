      "description": "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected. Wednesday\u2019s consumer price index report showed that Trump could end up facing the same challenges that dragged down his predecessor, President Joe Biden. The annual inflation rate has risen over the three months since the November election to 3%. Gasoline prices in particular have climbed despite Trump\u2019s claims that his return to the presidency would signal increased oil production that would lower energy costs. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that even U.S. presidents are subject to the invisible hand of supply and demand, rather than the masters of it.",

      "description": "Egg prices have reached a record high in the U.S. The consumer price index released on Wednesday confirmed what consumers, bakers and food companies already knew: an ongoing bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 are making eggs terribly expensive right now. The average price of a dozen Grade A eggs in U.S. cities reached $4.95 in January, eclipsing the previous record of $4.82 set in January 2023. Of course, that is only the nationwide average. A carton of eggs can cost $10 or more in some places. And specialized varieties, such as organic and cage-free eggs, are even more expensive.",

Musk has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with President Donald Trump\u2019s blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That\u2019s included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.

Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla, also joked that he was the \u201cWhite House\u2019s tech support,\u201d borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",

Instead of entering the U.S. illegally, they are ditching, or at least pausing, their ambitions of reaching the U.S. and instead looking to build a life in Mexico. Migrants trying to apply for asylum in Mexico in January more than tripled compared to the monthly average from the previous year, according to an international official with knowledge of the numbers who was not authorized to discuss them publicly.",
