      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office thrashing of Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy has laid bare the limits of a full-court press by America\u2019s allies aimed at reshaping Trump\u2019s determination to end Russia\u2019s invasion even if the terms are not to Ukraine\u2019s liking. It also shows the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect U.S. foreign policy priorities toward his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term. The episode has left in doubt the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia.",

The summit on Sunday will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania, as well as the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council.",

      "description": "Key Republicans and Democrats have been stalwart supporters of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But a blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to sign a deal Friday that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Instead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance further splintered American political support for Ukraine. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has backed Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster.\"",

The argument, broadcast globally on Friday, was perhaps unique in American history. It led to the rest of Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit being canceled and called into question how much the U.S. will still support Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.",

Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy during an Oval Office meeting on Friday for what they saw as a lack of gratitude for past U.S. aid, a confrontation that pleased Moscow. The friction cast doubt on future U.S. support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia. But despite the diplomatic fallout, many Ukrainians supported Zelenskyy\u2019s firm stance. Officials across Ukraine praised their leader's resilience, while some cautioned against losing crucial U.S. backing.",

The northern New Mexico city has a reputation of being a refuge for actors and authors seeking to escape the spotlight. Nestled among pi\u00f1on- and juniper-scented foothills, it's far from the glitz of Los Angeles or New York City. The normally laid back city was in collective shock this week as news spread that Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, had been found dead inside their home. Other acclaimed artists who live in Santa Fe include the actors Shirley MacLaine and Ali MacGraw, and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",

He's undertaken a purge at the FBI and Department of Justice. He's forced out federal officials who are responsible for overseeing ethics and protecting whistleblowers. He's declared control over independent agencies such as the Federal Elections Commission. And he's gone after the arts and the media. Trump says he's the one who's saving American democracy. Yet his actions have raised alarms that the country's 240-year-old form of democratic government is under threat.",

The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.",
