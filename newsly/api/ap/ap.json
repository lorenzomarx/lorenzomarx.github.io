Sunday's ceremony in St. Peter's Square blends ancient ritual, evocative symbols and a nod to modern-day celebrity. Leo will start the day by taking his first tour through the piazza in the popemobile. The open-topped vehicle has become synonymous with the papacy\u2019s global reach and mediatic draw. Leo will receive the two potent symbols of the papacy during the Mass. They are the lambswool stole known as a pallium. And the fisherman\u2019s ring.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Saturday ripped into the retailer Walmart, saying on social media that it should eat the additional costs created by his import taxes. As the U.S. president has jacked up tariffs, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for the taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses. Most economic analyses are deeply skeptical of those claims and have warned that the tariffs would worsen inflation, but Walmart warned on Thursday that everything from bananas to children\u2019s car seats could increase in price.",

      "description": "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d There are variations. Some are expansive family dramas (\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\u201d). Some are more intimate (\u201cRushmore\u201d). Some are more densely layered (\u201cAsteroid City\u201d). \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a leaner tale which Focus Features will release May 30, is Anderson working in high comic gear. A playful and poignant kind of thriller, it stars Benicio Del Toro as the tycoon Zsa-Zsa Korda, who decides to name his daughter heir to his dubiously accrued fortune.",
