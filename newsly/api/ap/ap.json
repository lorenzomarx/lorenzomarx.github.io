      "description": "President Donald Trump has rolled out his plan to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports. The Republican is possibly triggering a broader economic confrontation with allies and rivals alike as he hopes to eliminate any trade imbalances. Trump said Thursday: \u201cTODAY IS THE BIG ONE: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!\u201d The prospect of a dramatic hike on tariffs could send shockwaves through the world economy, possibly depressing growth while also causing inflation to intensify. Most economists say the tariffs would effectively be a tax increase on U.S. consumers. Trump says he's decided \u201cfor purposes of fairness\" he'll charge reciprocal tariffs.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is intensifying its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce by ordering agencies to lay off all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection. Hundreds of thousands of workers could be affected. In addition, workers at some agencies have been warned that large workplace cuts are coming. The Office of Personnel Management told agencies on Thursday to lay off all probationary employees. It\u2019s expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs throughout the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week that told agencies to plan for \u201clarge-scale reductions in force.\u201d",

Judge Amir Ali issued the order Thursday in a lawsuit brought by companies that receive U.S. funding for programs abroad. In his order, Ali noted that the Trump administration argued it had to shut down funding for the thousands of U.S. Agency for International Development aid programs abroad to conduct a thorough review of each program and whether it should be eliminated. The ruling was the first to temporarily roll back a Trump administration funding freeze on foreign assistance that has forced USAID and State Department contractors around the world to stop providing humanitarian aid and lay off staff.",

It's a stunning escalation in a dayslong standoff over the Trump administration prioritizing political aims over criminal culpability. Sassoon is a Republican who was interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. She accused the department of acceding to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 namely, dropping the case to ensure Adams\u2019 help with Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. And she said she was \u201cconfident\u201d the Democratic mayor committed the crimes spelled out in his indictment, and even more.",
