      "description": "Democratic officials and protesters on the streets are demanding that federal immigration officers leave Minnesota after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis. Saturday's shooting drew hundreds of demonstrators into the frigid cold in a city already shaken by another killing weeks earlier. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara says information about what led up to the latest shooting is limited. The man has been identified by his parents as Alex Pretti. He was a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse. The Minnesota National Guard assisted local police in monitoring the crowds.",

Cheers erupted from a street-level crowd as he reached the top of the spire of the 1,667-foot tower about 90 minutes after he started on Sunday. Wearing a red short-sleeve shirt, he waved his arms back and forth over his head. Honnold's free solo climb of the iconic building in Taiwan's capital was being broadcast live on Netflix. The ascent was delayed for 24 hours due to rain.",

The landslide on Saturday buried 34 houses in Pasir Langu village. Seventy-two people remain missing, feared buried under mud and debris. About 230 residents have been evacuated to shelters. A 250-member search team collected victims' remains in 14 body bags, bringing the total found to 25. Loose ground prevents heavy equipment from being used. Indonesian Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka visited the area and urged local authorities to address land conversion in disaster-prone areas to prevent similar incidents.",

      "description": "European leaders are finding a way to speak with one voice against President Donald Trump and they're increasingly willing to say \u201cno\u201d to his demands. Trump's insistence on U.S. control over Greenland has sparked strong opposition from European leaders. During a showdown in Davos, Switzerland, last week, the prime ministers of Britain and Norway issued sharp warnings against Trump's threats. That European unity marks a shift from appeasing Trump to defying him, and Denmark's prime minister emphasized the importance of standing together. Trump's transactional approach to diplomacy has created a disconnect with European leaders.",

That is a striking aspect of a new case against anti-ICE protesters in St. Paul, Minnesota. The group disrupted a service last Sunday at Cities Church, a Southern Baptist congregation. One of its pastors works for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Three protesters have been arrested. They are charged under a federal law criminalizing any conspiracy against someone\u2019s constitutional rights, in this case attending a worship service.",

Some 12% of employed adults say they use AI daily in their job, while nearly half say they've used it at least a few times a year. That compares with 21% who were using AI at least occasionally a few years ago. The findings point to the impact of the widespread commercial boom that ChatGPT sparked for generative AI tools that can write emails and computer code, summarize long documents or help answer questions. The Gallup Workforce survey of more than 22,000 U.S. workers was conducted last fall.",

      "description": "Millions of people rely on wearable devices to monitor how well they're sleeping. Sleep trackers don\u2019t necessarily measure sleep directly but instead infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement. Experts say it's therefore important to understand what the devices can and cannot measure. A University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables says the algorithms used by major brands are highly accurate in determining when someone is asleep and somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages. But a neurologist at the Morehouse School of Medicine says some wearers become fixated on their sleep scores. There's even a medical term for an unhealthy obsession with ideal sleep: orthosomnia.",
