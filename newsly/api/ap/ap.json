      "description": "Israeli airstrikes have hit Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, just days after the Iran-backed rebels fired cluster munitions toward Israel. That's according to the rebel-run media office and a local television station, which reported the strikes on Sunday. The attack was the first to hit the rebel-held Sanaa since a week ago, when Israel said targeted energy infrastructure it believed was used by the rebels. Israel has not confirmed Sunday\u2019s attack. The Houthis have launched missiles and drones toward Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea for more than 22 months. They say they are carrying out the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the war in the Gaza Strip.",
