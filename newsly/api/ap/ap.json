      "description": "Israel\u2019s military warned people Thursday to evacuate the area around Iran\u2019s Arak heavy water reactor. The warning came in a social media post on X. It included a satellite image of the plant in a red circle like other warnings that proceeded strikes. The Arak heavy water reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",

      "description": "Celebrations are planned around the country to commemorate the Juneteenth holiday marking the day in 1865 when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Texas. The observances on Thursday come even as the Trump administration has been removing content about African American history from federal websites. Nevertheless, the day remains a federal holiday. The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire has been holding events for the last two weeks, though the state itself hasn't made the holiday a permanent paid and legal one. Organizers say they want participants to think about how the story of America would change if told by the descendants of enslaved people.",

He even claimed once to have made Juneteenth \u201cvery famous.\u201d But on this year's Juneteenth holiday on Thursday, Trump kept silent about a day important to Black Americans for marking the end of slavery in the country he leads again. The president had been expected to issue a proclamation about Juneteenth but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters she wasn't tracking that. She declined to say whether Trump would recognize the occasion another way or on another day.",

      "description": "An appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids. Thursday\u2019s decision halts a ruling from a lower court judge who found Trump acted illegally by activating the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The deployment was the first by a president of a state National Guard without the governor\u2019s permission since 1965 and the court case could have wider implications on the president\u2019s power to deploy soldiers within the United States. Trump argued the troops were necessary to restore order, but Newsom said the move inflamed tensions and usurped local authority.",

The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.",

They say it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid. The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president\u2019s spending bill. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible. For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday.",
