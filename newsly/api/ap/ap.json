There\u2019s still no word on whether Nancy Guthrie is alive, and authorities say they have no suspects connected to the case. Her purported abductors sent ransom notes with a Monday deadline demanding money for her return. Savannah Guthrie says the family is prepared to pay. Investigators say they believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home against her will on Jan. 31, and there are growing concerns about her health because she needs daily medication.",

      "description": "House lawmakers tried to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, but the former girlfriend and confidant of Jeffrey Epstein invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be incriminating. An attorney for Maxwell also told lawmakers that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she would be willing to testify that neither Trump nor former President Bill Clinton were culpable for wrongdoing in their relationships with Epstein, according to both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who exited the closed-door meeting. The House Oversight Committee had wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she\u2019s serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking",

The statement came after police said they were examining reports that the former prince, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, sent trade reports to Epstein in 2010. Thames Valley Police, which serves areas west of London, including the ex-royal\u2019s former home in Windsor, launched the inquiry after news organizations reported on emails that suggest the then-prince sent Epstein reports from a 2010 tour of Southeast Asia he took as Britain\u2019s envoy for international trade.",

Adm. Daryl Caudle\u2019s strategy aims to create more flexible and tailored groups of ships and equipment. It comes as the Trump administration has moved aircraft carriers to crisis regions, often disrupting deployment plans and putting increasing strain on vessels and equipment that are already facing mounting maintenance issues. Caudle tells The Associated Press that the Navy's presence in regions like the Caribbean can be leaner and better tailored to actual threats, using smaller combat ships, helicopters and drones instead of destroyers and aircraft carriers.",

The tentative agreement announced Monday involves Montefiore and Mount Sinai hospital systems. Nurses remain on strike at NewYork Presbyterian. The walkout began Jan. 12. The hospitals scrambled to hire legions of temporary nurses to fill in during a demanding flu season. Mount Sinai alone hired 1,400 temporary nurses. The three-year deal, which still needs to be approved by union members, affects roughly 10,500 of the some 15,000 nurses on strike at some of the city\u2019s biggest private, nonprofit hospitals.",
