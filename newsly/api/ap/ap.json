      "description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi says a woman who led an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church has been arrested. Bondi announced the arrest of Nekima Levy Armstrong in a post on X on Thursday. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement serves as a pastor. The group interrupted services by chanting \u201cICE out\u201d and \u201cJustice for Renee Good,\u201d referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month. Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and prominent local activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign.",

      "description": "Federal agents have detained a 5-year-old boy and his father in Minnesota, taking them to a detention facility in Texas. School officials and the family's lawyer say this is part of the ongoing immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities. Zena Stenvik, the school superintendent in the Minneapolis suburb of Columbia Heights, says the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, was \u201cessentially\u201d used \u201cas bait\u201d to apprehend his father, who is pursuing an asylum claim in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security says the operation targeted the father, not the child. It's not clear if the father asked for his son to be taken into custody with him. Liam is the district's fourth student who has been detained recently.",

      "description": "Former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith's congressional hearing is underway. Thursday's hearing is expected to focus fresh attention on Smith's two criminal investigations that shadowed Donald Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. Smith testified behind closed doors last month but returns to the House Judiciary Committee for a public hearing. The hearing is likely to divide along partisan lines between Republican lawmakers looking to undermine Smith and Democrats hoping to elicit new and damaging testimony about Trump\u2019s conduct in the Washington, D.C., and Florida cases. The hearing unfolds against the backdrop of an ongoing Trump administration retribution campaign targeting the investigators who scrutinized the Republican president.",

Meteorologists say ice may linger on roads and sidewalks because temperatures will be slow to warm in many areas. Ice could also weigh down trees and power lines, triggering widespread outages. Forecasters say the storm will hit much of the nation\u2019s midsection starting Friday and then head toward the East Coast through Sunday. The National Weather Service said the coldest windchills may fall below minus 50 Fahrenheit across the Northern Plains.",

It's an idea that was initially envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the Gaza ceasefire. But it has morphed into something far more ambitious. The rollout of the board has been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s pressure campaign over acquiring Greenland. Some European leaders have said they'll take a pass on the new panel that Trump has suggested could eventually make the United Nations obsolete. Trump wants to spotlight the proposed board on Thursday.",

He alleges the bank closed his accounts for political reasons after he left office in January 2021. The lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade County court, claims JPMorgan abruptly closed multiple accounts in February 2021, giving 60 days' notice without explanation. Trump says this cut him off from millions and disrupted his businesses. JPMorgan, in a statement, expressed regret over the lawsuit but denied political motives. A spokesperson said the suit lacks merit, emphasizing accounts are closed for legal or regulatory risks, not political reasons.",

Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump, calling the talks productive. He urges Europe to become a global force, contrasting its response to Washington's actions in Venezuela and Iran. Despite European support, internal disagreements and slow responses frustrate Kyiv.

The government has funded research involving fetal tissue for decades, under both Republicans and Democrats. The tissue has been critical for research involving HIV, cancer and other diseases. Opponents say there are alternatives, although scientists say there aren't always adequate substitutes. The policy announced Thursday expands restrictions issued in the first Trump administration to cover all NIH-funded research. In 2024, the $47 billion agency counted just 77 funded projects that included fetal tissue.",
