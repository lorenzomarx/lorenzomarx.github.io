      "description": "Ukrainian officials and analysts say Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has few options but to draw U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s ire against Vladimir Putin, while depending on Europe\u2019s support. Ukraine\u2019s strategy since U.S.-brokered peace talks were launched is to convince the Trump administration the Russian leader is unreliable and that only Kyiv is serious about peace. It\u2019s a rhetorical game of pingpong in which both Kyiv and Moscow are trying to outmaneuver the other vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. But the political theatrics underscore stark realities on the ground. In this war of attrition against Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s position is poised to grow weaker as time goes on.",

      "description": "The crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, as Israel blocks all food and supplies from entering the territory and continues an intensifying bombardment campaign. Humanitarian officials caution that famine threatens to engulf the strip. Doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions. Israeli officials vow even more vigorous attacks. The military is preparing for a new organization with U.S. backing to take over aid delivery, despite alarms raised from humanitarian groups. Bushra Khalidi of the humanitarian nonprofit Oxfam calls it the deadliest and most destructive phase of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.",

Over two dissenting votes, the justices acted Friday on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men who have been accused of being gang members. The administration says that designation makes them eligible for rapid removal from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The high court had already called a temporary halt to the deportations from a north Texas detention facility in a middle-of-the-night order issued last month. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.",

Hundreds of homeless individuals are estimated to be sleeping in Madrid's airport, but that could soon change. Spain's airport authority this week said that it would start limiting who could enter the airport during periods of low-travel to prevent the homelessness problem from getting worse. A political blame game between Spanish authorities at different levels of government has meant that the issue has largely gone unaddressed.",

A lawyer for the Bad Boy Records founder conceded Combs was a jerk and a swinger prone to violence, but argued he wasn't a sex trafficker.",
