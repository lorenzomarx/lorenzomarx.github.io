      "description": "President Donald Trump unleashed an unprecedented barrage of executive orders after taking office this week. It's a sign that he's breaching the traditional boundaries of executive power as he returns to the White House. Although he tried to follow a similar playbook during his first term, there are fewer guardrails this time. His administration is stocked with loyalists, there's a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court and Republicans are in full control of Washington. Legal battles could eventually slow Trump down, but in the meantime he's drafting a blunt force blueprint for the presidency.",

      "description": "An AP-NORC poll finds many U.S. adults support the idea of beefing up security at the southern border and undertaking some deportations. But as President Donald Trump begins his second term with sweeping executive orders on immigration, the survey's findings suggest his actions may quickly push the country beyond the limited consensus that exists on the issue. The vast majority of U.S. adults favor deporting immigrants convicted of violent crimes, and the Republican administration\u2019s deportation efforts may begin there. But Trump's initial executive orders have gone far beyond that \u2014 including pushes to keep asylum-seekers in Mexico and end automatic citizenship.",

The website now gives users an \u201cError 404\u201d message and a \u201cGo To Home Page\u201d button that directs them to a page featuring a video montage of Trump in his first term and on the campaign trail. The Spanish profile of the White House\u2019 X account and the government page on reproductive freedom also were disbanded. Hispanic advocates and others expressed frustration at the change. Asked about it, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said Tuesday the administration is committed to bringing back the Spanish section of the site.",

      "description": "The Justice Department is directing its federal prosecutors to investigate any state or local officials who stand in the way of beefed-up enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration. That's according to a memo to the entire workforce obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday. The memo was written by Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general. The memo says the department will return to the principle of charging defendants with the most serious crime it can prove, a staple position of Republican-led departments meant to remove a prosecutor\u2019s discretion to charge a lower-level offense. The three-page memo signals an immediate and sharp turnabout in priorities from the prior administration.",

Warning areas included big cities like Jacksonville, where snow, sleet and ice could accumulate Wednesday. Blowing and drifting snow was expected in eastern North Carolina with near-blizzard conditions in the state\u2019s Outer Banks, where up to 8 inches of snow was predicted to fall. The National Weather Service says New Orleans set a record for snowfall on Tuesday, with nearly 10 inches. A blast of Arctic air has also plunged much of the Midwest and the eastern U.S. into a deep freeze.",
