      "description": "A federal judge says he's found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg said Wedneday that the administration must try to \u201cpurge\u201d itself of a contempt finding or he'll launch hearings and potentially refer the matter for prosecution. The move by Boasberg marks an escalation in a battle between the judicial and executives branches of government over a president\u2019s powers to carry out key White House priorities.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s defense minister says that troops will remain in so-called security zones in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely. Israeli forces have taken over large areas of Gaza in recent weeks in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law.",

Israel says it needs to hold on to the zones to prevent similar attacks, but the takeovers amount to military occupation. The acquisition of territory by force is universally seen as a violation of international law. Israel, which has captured territory during wars with its Arab neighbors going back to its establishment in 1948, says this is a special case.",

The Republican president says in a post on his social media platform he'll attend the meeting Wednesday alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Trump recently announced a round of global tariffs but then quickly put them on hold for 90 days after the markets tanked. Japan's 24% across-the-board tariff is on hold. But a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. remain in place.",

The lawsuit follows weeks of feuding between the Republican administration and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills that has led to threats to cut off crucial federal funding.
