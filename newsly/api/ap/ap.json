      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken executive action to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico. The move fulfills campaign promises but also sparked retaliatory moves that could signal an extended trade war with key trading partners and, in the case of Mexico and Canada, the closest U.S. neighbors and allies. Unlike during the 2024 campaign, when Trump billed his economic agenda as a sure-fire way to reduce the cost of living for American workers, the president now is acknowledging what many economists have long forecasted: the levies could yield higher prices and lower supplies across the market.",

      "description": "Canada\u2019s prime minister and Mexico\u2019s president have ordered retaliatory tariffs against Americans, following through with their threats after U.S. Donald Trump sparked a trade war by imposing sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. Canada had been very proactive for months saying it will retaliate, while Mexico kept a more cautious approach on recent weeks, but in the end both did what they had promised: retaliate. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum spoke in a telephone call before Trudeau announced Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs but there is no indication the two countries are coordinating responses.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. He's also claiming that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States. The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort are causing a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty. And they're threatening to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year\u2019s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. The tariffs are set to launch on Tuesday.",

His tariffs against Canada and Mexico in order to stop illegal immigration and the illicit fentanyl trade have led to retaliatory taxes by both countries on U.S. imports. He's placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. He's done so without congressional approval and by his own acknowledgement at the chance of \u201csome pain\u201d in the form of higher inflation, job losses and worse growth for Americans.",

      "description": "Even in war, branding applies. Israel and Hamas are engaged in a parallel battle of optics despite a ceasefire that took effect Jan. 19 after more than a year of devastating war. Throughout, each side has released highly choreographed photos and video of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that started the war and the relentless Israeli bombing of Gaza that came after. The propaganda is designed to make each side look virtuous and strong, and each other as monstrous and weak. This week's hostage releases also told the truth: On Thursday, images of chaotic crowds surrounding hostage Arbel Yehoud raised concerns about whether Hamas was really in control. Israel, meanwhile, airs footage of joyful reunions of the hostage families.",
