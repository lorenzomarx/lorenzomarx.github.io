      "description": "The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation\u2019s highest court upholding a law that\u2019s set to officially cut the cord and halt new downloads off the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced in the coming days, remain. That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",

      "description": "With President-elect Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple. The two companies are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days. But it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday. Under the law, mobile app stores and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could face fines of up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, which means the penalties could total a large sum.",

      "description": "The supremely popular TikTok could be banned on Jan. 19 under a federal law that forces the video sharing platform to divest itself from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or shut down its U.S. operations. Several parties have expressed interest in buying the platform, but ByteDance has repeatedly said it does not plan to sell. On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the law following a legal challenge by the two companies and some TikTok users. Experts have also noted the Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale that includes TikTok\u2019s coveted algorithm. But until the deadline passes, the possibility of a purchase is still possible.",

The ACLU of Vermont and Pregnancy Justice, a national advocacy group, filed a lawsuit this week on behalf of a woman who says the Vermont Department for Children and Families relied on baseless allegations about her mental health to secretly investigate her while she was pregnant and win custody of her daughter before the baby was born in February 2022. The lawsuit, which also names a counseling center and the hospital where the woman gave birth, seeks both an end to what it calls an illegal surveillance program and unspecified monetary damages for the woman.",

Blinken said that \u201cif past is prologue,\u201d there's reason to be concerned that the new administration might not follow through on initiatives that Biden\u2019s national security team put into place to end the war in Gaza, keep Ukraine free of Russian interference and maintain strengthened alliances with key partners.",

The court held Friday the risk to national security posed by TikTok's ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the U.S. A sale does not appear imminent. The court\u2019s decision means new users won\u2019t be able to download the app and updates won\u2019t be available, but it won\u2019t disappear from users\u2019 phones. Trump had called on the court to keep the ban on hold until after he takes office Monday.",

The conversation comes ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday. The U.S.-China relationship is expected to be one of the main focuses of Trump\u2019s second term, with tensions between the two superpowers looming in the areas of trade, technology and the self-ruled island of Taiwan, among other things. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% on all Chinese imports into the U.S. But he has also in the past praised his relationship with Xi and has suggested China could help mediate international crises such as the war in Ukraine.",

The Republican president-elect says the weather forecast for Washington, D.C., with the windchill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows.

The swearing-in was last moved indoors in 1985, when President Ronald Reagan began his second term. Monday\u2019s forecast calls for the lowest inauguration day temperatures since that day.",
