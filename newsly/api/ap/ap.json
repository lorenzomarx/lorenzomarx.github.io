That impasse has led to a pause in funding for the Department of Homeland Security. A partial government shutdown began Saturday after congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump\u2019s team failed to reach a deal on legislation to fund the department through September. Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration operations are conducted after the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by federal officers in Minneapolis last month.

The Pentagon said in a statement Sunday that U.S. forces boarded the Veronica III after tracking it from the Caribbean Sea.

The Defense Department says U.S. forces boarded the Veronica III overnight. The Pentagon\u2019s social media post doesn't say whether the ship was formally seized.",

      "description": "As the definition of autism has widened, there\u2019s been a growing push to separate profound autism into its own diagnosis. Proponents seek to ensure that autistic people who need lifelong care get the support and services they need. Judith Ursitti, president of the Profound Autism Alliance, said people in this category now lack appropriate treatments, support and enough providers trained to handle their level of care. And the vast majority of clinical research doesn\u2019t include them. But some in the autism community worry that creating a separate diagnosis of profound autism would reduce attention on the broader spectrum and the individual needs of everyone on it.",
