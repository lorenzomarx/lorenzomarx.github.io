      "description": "The House is expected to approve President Donald Trump\u2019s request to claw back about $9 billion for public broadcasting and foreign aid. A final vote to approve the spending cuts package is scheduled for Thursday evening. Republicans are targeting institutions and programs they view as bloated or out of step with their agenda. The White House has described the package as a test case and says if Congress goes along, more requests will come. The House\u2019s approval would mark the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a request to Congress.",

Druze leaders and Syrian government officials announced a renewed ceasefire late Wednesday that was mediated by the U.S., Turkey and Arab countries. Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said in an address early Thursday that some Druze factions and clerics were appointed to maintain internal security in Sweida. Israeli strikes targeting government troops did not immediately stop. The dayslong fighting has threatened to unravel Syria\u2019s postwar political transition and brought in further military intervention by Israel.",

      "description": "Just 1 in 4 U.S. adults say President Donald Trump\u2019s policies have helped them. That's according to a new AP-NORC poll that finds underwhelming marks for the Republican president on key issues, including the economy, immigration, government spending and health care. Overall, Trump fails to earn majority approval on any of the issues included in the poll. A majority of Americans see Trump as at least somewhat capable of getting things done following the passage of his sprawling budget bill. The mixed reviews come six months into Trump's term as he struggles to follow through on some campaign promises, including lowering costs for working-class Americans, preserving programs like Medicaid and lowering government spending.",

Her death was announced Thursday by her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, who didn't immediately provide additional details. Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \u201cWho\u2019s Sorry Now?\u201d and including the No. 1 songs \u201cDon\u2019t Break the Heart That Loves You\u201d and \u201cThe Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\u201d",

The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that Juul's benefits as a less harmful alternative for adult smokers outweigh the risks of teen use. It's a major win for a company that has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend. Parents, politicians and antitobacco advocates wanted a ban on the devices that many blame for the recent spike in underage vaping. The FDA decision applies to both tobacco and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product.",
