      "description": "President Donald Trump has celebrated the 100th day of his second term \u2014 yet spent much of his rally marking it in campaign mode, fixated on past grudges and grievances. He repeatedly mocked his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, at Tuesday's rally \u2014 attacking Biden's mental acuity and even how he appears in a bathing suit. He again uttered the lie that he won the 2020 presidential election. And he attacked polling and news coverage not favorable to him. And the rally just outside Detroit, which marked Trump\u2019s largest political event since returning to the White House, glossed over two forces that had rocked the state: his steep trade tariffs and combative attitude toward Canada.",

      "description": "American businesses are cancelling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down to see what trade policy surprises President Donald Trump plans to spring on them next. The president\u2019s massive and unpredictable taxes on imports seems likely to mean emptier shelves and higher prices for American shoppers, perhaps within weeks. And the higher costs and paralyzing uncertainty are likely to exact an economic toll: U.S. consumers are in the biggest funk since COVID-19 hit five years ago, and economists say recession risks are climbing. An early sign of the damage is expected to emerge on Wednesday when the government is expected to report that the economy expanded at an annual pace of just 0.8% from January through March.",

Officials, meanwhile, said that a nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city of Kharkiv wounded at least 45 civilians. The United Nations reported that the number of Ukrainian civilian casualties in the more than three-year war has surged in recent weeks. Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin backs calls for a ceasefire \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances.\u201d",

The country won't know until later Tuesday whether the party of new Prime Minister Mark Carney will have an outright majority or need help in Parliament. And the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation projects that populist Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre will lose his Parliament seat. That caps a stunning turnaround in fortunes fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s annexation threats and trade war. Poilievre a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.",
