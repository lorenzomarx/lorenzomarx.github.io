      "description": "President Donald Trump is touting tens of billions of dollars of energy and tech investments at a new summit focusing on energy and innovation. At the event Tuesday in Pittsburgh helmed by Republican Sen. David McCormick, Trump boasted of a \u201ctrue golden age for America\u201d in energy policy and artificial intelligence. Pennsylvania is a swing state critical to Trump's wins in 2016 and 2024, and is at the forefront of his energy agenda. In a panel discussion, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Trump administration won't let the U.S. lose the artificial intelligence race. Participating companies at the conference included Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services and ExxonMobil.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is downplaying the possibility of sending Ukraine long-range weapons as Kyiv awaits an injection of U.S. weaponry that it hopes will help it beat back an intensifying Russian air offensive. Trump on Tuesday offered a more cautious tone on what to expect after he threatened Russia a day earlier with steep tariffs if President Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t soon end the three-year conflict. Trump also told the BBC in an interview published Tuesday that he trusts \u201calmost nobody\u201d when asked whether he trusts Putin. It was further evidence of a break with Putin, whom he has long spoken admiringly of.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he plans to place tariffs of over 10% on smaller countries, including nations in Africa and the Caribbean. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably set one tariff for all of them,\u201d Trump said Tuesday, adding that it could be \u201ca little over 10% tariff\u201d on goods from at least 100 nations. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick interjected that the nations with goods being taxed at these rates would be in Africa and the Caribbean, places that generally do relatively modest levels of trade with the U.S. and would be relatively insignificant for addressing Trump\u2019s goals of reducing trade imbalances with the rest of the world.",

      "description": "Major League Baseball faces a potential lockout in December 2026. Players and management have long clashed over salary cap proposals, a format that union head Tony Clark criticizes as harmful to competition and player salary guarantees. Commissioner Rob Manfred argues the cap could address payroll disparities as MLB also tries to deal with declining revenue from regional sports networks. Teams like the Dodgers and Mets have pushed payrolls to record levels, highlighting disparity. Baseball\u2019s collective bargaining agreement expires in December 2026, and past negotiations have led to nine work stoppages.",

Last week, the Justice Department and the FBI abruptly walked back the notion there's an Epstein client list of elites who participated in the wealthy New York financier\u2019s trafficking of underage girls. The Republican president quickly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi, but the online backlash was swift.",

The changes are designed to build momentum for the package before two key test votes on Tuesday evening. The amended package will remove proposed cuts to a program known as PEPFAR that is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush to combat HIV/AIDS. Trump is looking to claw back money for foreign aid programs targeted by his Department of Government Efficiency and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The change to save the PEPFAR funding will preserve about $400 million that the administration had sought to cancel.",
