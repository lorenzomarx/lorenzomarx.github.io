      "description": "The Kremlin has declared a 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine next week as Russia marks Victory Day in World War II. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the truce will run from the start of May 8 and last through the end of May 10 to mark Moscow\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Kyiv insisted on a longer and immediate truce. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump scaled up efforts to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. Until now, Putin had refused to accept a complete unconditional ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies to Ukraine and Kyiv\u2019s mobilization effort.",

      "description": "A conclave to elect a successor to Pope Francis will begin on Wednesday, May 7, the Vatican announced Monday. The date of the conclave was chief on the agenda of cardinals holding informal meetings to hash out church business following the April 21 death of Pope Francis. They held off on announcing the opening of the conclave until after his funeral on Saturday. The Vatican said more than 180 participated in the fifth informal meeting in Rome on Monday. A smaller group of 135, known as the College of Cardinals, is eligible to elect a new pope.",

      "description": "The weeks since President Donald Trump returned to office have been a whirlwind of activity to show Americans his administration is relentlessly pursuing his promises. As Trump hits his 100th day in office Tuesday, his imprint is everywhere. But the long-term impact is often unclear. Some of Trump's executive orders are statements of intent or groundwork to achieve what has yet to be done. The Republican president\u2019s goals occasionally conflict with each other. Some are languishing. Very much unsettled is whether Trump has run up his scorecard lawfully. Trump has faced lawsuits, meaning much of what he\u2019s done could be undone as cases play out.",

Hundreds attended vigils Sunday across the city for the victims and the Canadian prime minister visited the site on the eve of a federal election. Prosecutors have charged a 30-year-old man with eight counts of second degree murder and say more charges are possible. Investigators have ruled out terrorism and say he has a history of mental health issues. Those killed were between the ages of 5 and 65. Dozens were injured when a man driving an SUV struck people attending the Lapu Lapu Day festival on Saturday.",

      "description": "Canadians are set to decide whether to extend the Liberal Party\u2019s decade in power or instead hand control to the Conservatives. They\u2019ll pick either Prime Minister Mark Carney or opposition leader Pierre Poilievre to lead the way forward, but Monday's election is also a referendum of sorts on a non-Canadian: Donald Trump. Until the American president won a second term and began threatening Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty, even suggesting the country should become the 51st state, the Liberals looked headed for defeat. But Trump\u2019s truculence has infuriated many Canadians and led to a tightening of the race. Whichever candidate becomes prime minister will face big challenges, including a trade war and resetting of Canada's relationship with the United States.",

Spanish power distributor Red El\u00e9ctrica says restoring power to large parts of the country could take 6-10 hours. The company declined to speculate on the causes of the blackout Monday. The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center says there was no sign of a cyberattack. The outage hit across Spain and Portugal, including their capitals. Later Monday, Spain\u2019s electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.",

There was no immediate independent confirmation of the death toll and the U.S. military has not acknowledged conducting the strike in Yemen\u2019s Saada governorate, a stronghold of the Houthis. Some 115 prisoners were held at the site. Graphic footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded there.",

They\u2019re more likely to miss school, and those who end up transferring are suspended more often. That\u2019s according to a groundbreaking analysis from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, published in Sociology of Education. Researchers paired court filings and student records from the Houston Independent School District. The researchers found students missed school more often even when they didn\u2019t have to change schools. Students who were threatened with eviction missed four more days in the following school year than their peers.",
