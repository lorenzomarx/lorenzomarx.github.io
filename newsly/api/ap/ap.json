      "description": "The deadline for the start of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip has passed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Hamas had not lived up to its commitment to provide the names of the three hostages it was set to release later on Sunday in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the top Israeli military spokesman, said the army \u201ccontinues to attack\u201d and would until Hamas complies with the agreement. Hamas blamed the delay in handing over the names on \u201ctechnical field reasons.\u201d An Israeli official said mediators have provided assurances that the list will be delivered and the deal is still expected to go forward, though the timing remains in question.",

      "description": "The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is set to begin on Sunday, pausing the devastating 15-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group in the Gaza Strip. The deal is the most significant breakthrough in the war, but its implementation is complex and fragile. It requires cooperation between Palestinian militant groups, the International Red Cross, the Israeli military, mediators from multiple countries and an Israeli government whose coalition is starting to fray as hard-line ministers express their disapproval.",

His youngest son, Barron, was in fifth grade when Trump's first administration began. He's now a college freshman. One of Trump's granddaughters is an aspiring social media influencer. Trump has tapped the fathers of his two sons-in-law for administration jobs. The president-elect has five children from his marriages to Ivana Trump, Marla Maples and current wife Melania Trump.

Experts say these survivors are victims themselves. The fires that swept through the Los Angeles area this month were fast-moving and fierce and there just wasn't more they could do. But that doesn\u2019t ease the pain or the questions for the families of the more than two dozen killed, some unable to escape, others unaware of what was coming, having survived other blazes unscathed. Despite reassurances, they can't help but second-guess if they could have done more.",

But many leaders, including King\u2019s own family, see the juxtaposition as an opportunity to reflect and refocus the work of advancing civil rights in a new political era.",
