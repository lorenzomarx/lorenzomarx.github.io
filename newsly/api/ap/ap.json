      "description": "Texas Democrats are leaving the state in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. The dramatic move Sunday could expose Democrats to fines and other penalties. Democrats have cast the decision to leave the state as a last-ditch effort to stop Republicans from pushing through a rare mid-decade redrawing of the congressional map. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature that started last month to take up the redistricting effort that President Donald Trump has urged.",

      "description": "Texas Democrats have fled the state in an effort to keep Republicans from approving a new U.S. House map that could boost their slim congressional majority next year. The Sunday walkout is the minority party\u2019s way of preventing Republicans in charge from having enough votes for maps that would add five new Republican-leaning congressional districts. Though such theatrics are uncommon, both parties have used walkouts to deny quorum in state legislatures from Oregon to New Hampshire. In some places, walking off the job, whether for a day or weeks at a time, has led to punishments including fines, civil arrest warrants or being booted from the ballot.",

About 3,200 workers at facilities in St. Louis and other locations voted to reject a modified four-year labor agreement with Boeing. That is according to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union. The union says its workers deserve nothing less than a contract that keeps their families secure and recognizes their unmatched expertise. Boeing says the company is disappointed its employees rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth and resolved issues about work schedules.",

      "description": "The Justice Department is ramping up an effort to get election data from the states. According to an Associated Press tally, the department's voting section has requested copies of voter registration lists from state election administrators in at least 15 states. And department lawyers have contacted officials in at least seven states to propose a meeting about forging an information-sharing agreement related to instances of voting or election fraud. The unusually expansive outreach has raised alarm among some election officials. That's because states have the constitutional authority to run elections and because federal law protects the sharing of individual data with the government.",
