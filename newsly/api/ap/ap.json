      "description": "The Israeli security cabinet is meeting Thursday evening to discuss expanding military operations in Gaza. An Israeli official says the cabinet is expected to approve a plan to gradually increase pressure on Hamas. Israel\u2019s Chief of Staff warns this could endanger hostages and exhaust troops. Demonstrations are planned across Israel to protest the expansion. Meanwhile, Israeli authorities have returned the body of a Palestinian activist allegedly killed by an Israeli settler last week, following a hunger strike by his relatives, and aid organizations denounce Israeli policies in Gaza.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has started imposing higher import taxes on goods from over 60 countries, including the European Union, Japan and South Korea. These tariffs, which began Thursday, are part of Trump's strategy to reduce the trade deficit and encourage foreign investment in the U.S. However, the economic impact is already visible, with signs of stalled hiring, rising inflation and declining home values. Despite the uncertainty, Trump remains optimistic about economic growth, while many experts warn of potential long-term damage.",

The Republican president said Thursday the census' data collections will be based on \u201cmodern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.\u201d It's an indication Trump might try to inject his politics into survey work measuring everything from child poverty to business operations. Trump stresses that as part of the changes people in the U.S. illegally will be excluded from census counts. Census changes could play into Trump's efforts to urge several Republican-led states to redraw congressional maps.",

Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the two sides are working on setting it up, and that a venue for the meeting has been agreed on and will be announced later.

      "description": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he wants to rework the U.S. program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines. The plan has long been a target of anti-vaccine groups and changing it could have far-reaching consequences for vaccine availibility. Government officials set up the program in the 1980s to limit the legal risks for vaccine makers. At the time many companies were leaving the business due to class action lawsuits. Kennedy and other critics have complained that the program shields vaccine makers from litigation and is too stingy in compensating injured patients.",

Overall, about 55% of calories consumed by Americans older than age 1 came from ultra-processed foods during August 2021 to August 2023. The top sources include burgers and sandwiches, sweet baked goods, savory snacks, pizza and sweetened drinks. Ultra-processed foods have been linked to chronic health problems. One surprising finding: Consumption of ultra-processed foods appeared to dip slightly over the past decade. One nutritionist says there may be greater awareness of the foods' potential harms.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 330 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.4%. Worries are still high that Trump\u2019s tariffs are damaging the economy, particularly after last week\u2019s U.S. jobs report. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates and a torrent of stronger-than-expected profit reports have helped overshadow the concerns, at least for now. Stock indexes also rose across much of Asia and Europe. Treasury yields were steady in the bond market.",
