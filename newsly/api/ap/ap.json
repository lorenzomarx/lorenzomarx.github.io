      "description": "Insiders have speculated about a potential falling-out between Donald Trump and Elon Musk for months. It never seemed to happen \u2014 until Thursday. The world\u2019s most powerful man and its wealthiest began attacking each other in a spectacle that left Washington breathless. The feud began with Musk\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, which would increase the deficit while eliminating tax incentives that have helped his electric automaker Tesla. Trump responded by threatening to cut government subsidies and contracts for Musk\u2019s companies, and things only escalated from there.",

      "description": "Elon Musk is threatening to decommission a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA. The threat came as President Donald Trump and Musk argued on social media on Thursday. Trump said he could cut government contracts given to Musk\u2019s SpaceX company. Musk responded by saying SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. It\u2019s unclear how serious he was. But SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. NASA\u2019s other immediate option is paying Russia to take U.S. astronauts up.",

Trump\u2019s proclamation, issued Wednesday, marked his administration\u2019s latest attempt to cut off Harvard from a quarter of its student body, which accounts for much of the elite university\u2019s research and scholarship. Hours earlier, Harvard had filed a legal challenge asking the federal judge to block Trump\u2019s order, calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard\u2019s rejection of White House demands. In an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order.",

The justices\u2019 decision Thursday affects lawsuits in 20 states and the District of Columbia where, until now, courts had set a higher bar when members of a majority group, including those who are white and heterosexual, sue for discrimination under federal law. The court ruled in an appeal from Marlean Ames, who's worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for years. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson says federal civil rights law draws no distinction between members of majority and minority groups.",

      "description": "North Korea says it righted a capsized destroyer and moored it at a pier in the northeastern port of Chongjin as it continues to repair a new warship leader Kim Jong Un has described as a significant asset for his nuclear-armed military. The report by North Korean state media aligned with South Korean military assessments and recent commercial satellite images, which indicated that the ship was in an upright position and floating in the harbor. Outside experts say it remains unclear how severely the 5,000-ton-class destroyer was damaged during a botched launching ceremony in late May, which triggered a furious response from Kim, who called the failure a \u201ccriminal act.\"",
