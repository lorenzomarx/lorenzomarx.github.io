      "description": "Hamas says it will delay the further release of hostages in the Gaza Strip after accusing Israel of violating a fragile ceasefire that now faces its most serious crisis since it began three weeks ago. Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas has committed to freeing dozens of the hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Three more Israeli hostages had been scheduled for release on Saturday, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. In a bid to improve relations with the U.S., the Palestinian president has ended a controversial system that paid stipends to the families of Palestinian prisoners, including those convicted of deadly attacks against Israel.",

The New Orleans police said Monday the performer would face no charges. In the Gaza Strip, much of the territory has been obliterated in an Israeli offensive triggered by a Hamas-led attack in 2023 that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local authorities. In Sudan, a civil war since April 2023 has killed more than 28,000 people. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll.",

In a nearly hour-long speech on the House floor, Mace accused her ex-fianc\u00e9 of physically abusing her and recording sex acts with her and others without their consent. She said she also has evidence of him conspiring with business associates in acts of rape and sexual misconduct. The former fianc\u00e9, Patrick Bryant, categorically denied all the allegations. Mace said she was speaking out because South Carolina's top prosecutor didn\u2019t take action.

Kim Jiyeon, a KDI economist, said the \u201cdeterioration of the trade environment\u201d following Trump\u2019s inauguration was a major factor. South Korea is also grappling with political instability caused by the impeachment and criminal indictment of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he briefly imposed martial law in December.",
