      "description": "More than 8,000 flights have been canceled across the U.S. as a major storm expected to wreak havoc across much of the country bears down. The storm threatens to knock out power for days and snarl major roadways. Roughly 140 million people were under a winter storm warning from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecast warns of widespread heavy snow and a band of catastrophic ice stretching from east Texas to North Carolina. The edge of the storm was sending freezing rain and sleet into parts of Texas on Friday night, while snow and sleet were falling in Oklahoma.",

      "description": "Russian attacks on Ukraine killed one person and wounded 18 overnight, as negotiators from Ukraine, Russia and the United States were set to met in Abu Dhabi for a second day of talks aimed at ending Moscow\u2019s nearly four-year invasion. One person died and four were wounded in Kyiv, while 14 were wounded in Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials said Saturday. The UAE-hosted talks mark the first known instance of Trump administration officials meeting with both countries. The White House called the first day productive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a peace deal was \u201cnearly ready,\u201d though territorial disputes remain unresolved.",

The attack on Friday took place at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government elder, in Dera Ismail Khan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who have carried out numerous attacks in the country in recent years. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban.",

ICE has released details on only a small number of arrests and provided limited information about the rest. State and local officials, attorneys and judges say the lack of context has made it difficult to assess who is being detained and why.",

School officials claim agents told the boy to knock on a door to lure out his mother. The Department of Homeland Security denies this, calling it a \"horrific smear.\" The father and son are now at a family detention center in Texas. School officials say other adults offered to care for the boy, but agents refused. The family's lawyer is exploring legal options. The Trump administration's policy on detained parents states ICE should not take custody of children, but exceptions exist.",

In the documents, the U.S. expresses \u201cappreciation\u201d to South Sudan for accepting the deportees and details the names, nationalities and crimes for which each individual was convicted. In July, South Sudan became the first African country to receive migrants deported from the U.S. Rwanda, Eswatini, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea have since received deportees.",

The document released late Friday is highly political for a military blueprint, criticizing partners from Europe to Asia for relying on previous U.S. administrations to subsidize their defense. It calls for \u201ca sharp shift \u2014 in approach, focus, and tone.\u201d That translates to a blunt assessment that allies must take on more of the burden countering nations from Russia to North Korea. It caps off a week of animosity between President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and traditional allies like Europe.",

Activists warn it shows Iran is engaging in the same tactics it has used for decades, just at an unprecedented scale. That includes firing down from rooftops on demonstrators, shooting birdshot into crowds and sending motorcycle-riding volunteer members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in to beat and detain those who can\u2019t escape. Meanwhile, a crackdown targeting protesters continues, with state media reporting dozens to hundreds of people detained daily.",

If winter weather is expected, airlines might also allow you to postpone your trip without fees. If your flight is canceled, airlines usually rebook for free, but availability can be limited during peak times. You're entitled to a full refund if you choose not to travel or find a different way to get to your destination, but airlines aren\u2019t required to cover lodging or meals for stranded passengers. Booking a backup flight if forecasts look bad is another option because some airlines offer full refunds as long as a passenger cancels within 24 hours of booking.",
