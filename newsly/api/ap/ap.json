The Trump administration has not publicly said how many immigrant detention beds it needs to achieve its goals, or what the cost will be. However, an estimated 11.7 million people are living in the U.S. illegally. Immigration and Customs Enforcement currently has the budget to detain only about 41,000 people. Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico leverages the U.S. military to shore up mass deportations and provide \u201cappropriate detention space.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union estimates that ICE is considering an expansion of immigrant detention space across at least eight states.",

They worry that the indiscriminate release of everyone charged in the riots could embolden extremists to commit more violence on the president\u2019s behalf \u2013 including during future elections. Some already have mimicked the president's call for retribution against perceived enemies. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader who was convicted of seditious conspiracy, said \u201cthe people who did this\u201d need to \u201cfeel the heat.\u201d",
