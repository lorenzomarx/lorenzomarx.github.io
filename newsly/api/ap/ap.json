      "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron has called leaders from key European Union nations and the United Kingdom to his ornate Elysee Palace for an emergency meeting Monday. He wants to discuss how to deal with the Trump administration and step up plans to increase defense spending. The European leaders have been stunned by a weeklong diplomatic blitz on Ukraine from the Trump administration that seemed to embrace the Kremlin while it cold-shouldered many of its age-old European allies. There were belligerent warnings ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s reelection as U.S. president. But EU leaders publicly ignored the ominous forebodings and somehow hoped Trump would stand side by side with Europe.",

U.S. President Donald Trump last week suggested he would be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, long has been floated as a possible site for peace talks as well given the large population of Russian and Ukrainian expatriates who have flooded the country since the war began, and due to the Emirates\u2019 work on prisoner exchanges in the past.",

Daily battles unfold along a front line 40 kilometers away as the Zaporizhstal Iron and Steelworks churns out materials for military equipment and for foreign manufacturers to use in cars, appliances, and construction. Last week, a second war came to the doorstep of the hulking factory: the possible trade war that U.S. President Donald Trump has provoked since returning to office. Trump's decision to impose tariffs of at least 25% on all imported steel and aluminum could hurt an essential sector of Ukraine\u2019s battered economy.",

The move comes ahead of Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia. Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow\u2019s Vnukovo airport after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by Byers\u2019 parents, that he has been released and was awaiting a flight home in the U.S. embassy in Moscow. A U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press that Byers was released late on Sunday evening. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive matters.",

But the current phase of the truce is set to expire in early March and it is unclear if the sides will extend it, begin negotiations for a more lasting ceasefire or resume fighting. The scale of death and devastation is seen in the numbers. Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel on that date and 251 hostages were taken. Around half of the 73 still captive there are believed to be dead. Over 48,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza.",

The country had expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars for most of this century. So what happened? A combination of domestic and geopolitical factors. German businesses complain about lagging public investments, too much red tape and a lack of skilled workers at home. New manufacturing competition from China and Russia's decision to stop supplying Germany with natural gas due to opposing views of the war in Ukraine compounded the situation.",

The federal holiday is officially Washington\u2019s Birthday to honor George, the first president, and 34 states use his name in some way. But 19 use some form of Presidents Day. That name took hold after the holiday became fixed in 1971 on the third Monday in February. The result is a jumble of names, dates and ideas about how to celebrate. Most states are honoring Washington and other figures Monday, but some don't stop with that. Civil War President Abraham Lincoln has his own holidays, and other presidents have days, too.",

      "description": "An anti-settlement watchdog says Israel has issued tenders for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler homes in the occupied West Bank. Peace Now said Monday the development would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Construction could begin as soon as next year. Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support.",
