      "description": "Israel\u2019s air campaign on Iran\u2019s capital appeared to broaden on the fourth day of an intensifying conflict as U.S. President Donald Trump posted an ominous message warning residents of the city to evacuate. Earlier, the Israeli military called for the some 330,000 residents of a neighborhood in the city center to evacuate. Israel says its sweeping assault on Iran\u2019s top military leaders, uranium enrichment sites and nuclear scientists, is necessary to prevent its longtime adversary from getting any closer to building an atomic weapon. The strikes have killed at least 224 people since Friday. Iran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel and more than 500 injured.",

      "description": "At least 51 Palestinians were killed and over 200 wounded in the Gaza Strip while waiting for U.N. and commercial trucks to enter the territory with desperately needed food, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and a local hospital. Palestinian witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli forces had fired on the crowds. The military said it was looking into reports that its forces had fired toward the crowd, causing several casualties. It did not appear to be related to a new Israeli- and U.S.-supported aid delivery network that rolled out last month and has been marred by controversy and violence.",

      "description": "Officials say a Russian missile and drone bombardment has killed at least 15 people and injured 156 others in Ukraine overnight, with the main barrage demolishing a nine-story apartment building in Kyiv. It was the deadliest attack on the Ukrainian capital this year and came as two rounds of direct peace talks have failed to make progress on ending the war, now in its fourth year. The city's military administration says 14 people were killed and 138 others were injured in the capital as explosions echoed for hours. Russia has repeatedly hit civilian areas of Ukraine with missiles and drones, and the United Nations says the attacks have killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians.",

The House of Commons voted 379-137 on Tuesday on an amendment to a broader crime bill that would bar the prosecution of women who take steps to end their pregnancies at any stage. Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour member of Parliament who introduced the amendment, said the change was needed because police have investigated more than 100 women for suspected illegal abortions over the past five years, including some who suffered natural miscarriages and stillbirths.",
