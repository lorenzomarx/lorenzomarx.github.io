      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed gratitude for U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to send more weapons to Ukraine, particularly Patriot air defense missile systems. But Ukrainians remain skeptical about the impact on the war of Washington's decision. Trump delayed \u201cvery severe\u201d sanctions on Russia for 50 days, sparking criticism from Ukrainians and European leaders who see the delay as too long. Moscow saw the postponement as a reprieve.",

      "description": "Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used for artificial intelligence to China. The company shared the news in a blog post late Monday and Huang also spoke about it on China's state-run CGTN television network. The White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China. Nvidia said the tighter export controls would cost it an extra $5.5 billion. Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying President Donald Trump to reverse the restrictions, arguing they hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in a major technology market.",

This follows deadly clashes between local Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze armed factions, which escalated when security forces intervened. The conflict began with kidnappings and attacks, raising fears of sectarian violence.

President Donald Trump has nominated him to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and he's set to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing Tuesday.

Waltz took responsibility for the episode. He faces lawmakers after months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous U.N. nominee.",

Prosecutors allege James Craig used cyanide and another chemical to kill Angela Craig two years ago in suburban Denver. They claim he searched online for ways to disguise a murder and bought arsenic and potassium cyanide.

Craig denies all charges, including first-degree murder, and his attorneys question the evidence and police bias. The trial is set to begin Tuesday.",

The British government disclosed the existence of the resettlement program on Tuesday. A dataset containing the personal information of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to come to Britain after the Taliban takeover of their country was released in error in 2022, and extracts were later published online. That prompted the then-Conservative government to set up a secret program to resettle the Afghans.",

The decision destabilizes Netanyahu's leadership amid the ongoing war in Gaza. The party, United Torah Judaism, cites disagreements over a bill granting military draft exemptions for its constituents. The issue has long divided Israelis and intensified as military demands grew during the war in Gaza. The departure, which goes into effect in 48 hours, leaves Netanyahu with a slim majority, increasing his reliance on far-right parties in his coalition. The political development comes as Israel and Hamas continue to discuss terms for a ceasefire.",
