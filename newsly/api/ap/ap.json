      "description": "Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have little more than 48 hours to explain what they accomplished over the last week. The order is part of billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s crusade to slash what he describes as \u201cwaste everywhere\" in the federal government. Musk, who serves as President Donald Trump\u2019s cost-cutting chief, shared the extraordinary request on his social media network on Saturday. He said that \u201cfailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\u201d Shortly afterward, federal employees received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\u201d Thousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce during the first month of Trump\u2019s administration.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is moving with light speed and brute force to reshape America at home and abroad. In his first month back in office, he's performed a pirouette in foreign policy as he pulls the U.S. back from historic alliances, reaches out to Russia and chokes foreign aid. At home, he's fired thousands of federal workers and mandated an about-face in the missions of department after department. How much of this sticks will largely depend on courts, which appear to be the only check on Trump's expansive use of executive power. Congress has so far been compliant as Trump pursues his ends by edict instead of legislation.",

Dan Caine, endeared himself to the commander in chief through his military call sign, \u201cRazin,\u201d during a meeting in Iraq years ago.

But doctors have warned that the main threat facing the 88-year-old Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur with pneumonia.
