      "description": "An Israeli official says Cabinet ministers have approved plans to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. The official said the plan was gradual and involved claiming more territory in the Palestinian enclave. The approval comes a day after Israel announced it was calling up tens of thousands of reservist for the expanded operations in Gaza, which Israel says are meant to increase pressure on the militant Hamas group to negotiate a ceasefire that better aligns with Israel\u2019s terms. An eight-week ceasefire with the Hamas militant group collapsed in March when Israel resumed strikes in Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians, many of them women and children.",

Abbas Araghchi's visit was the first to Pakistan by a foreign dignitary since tensions flared in the wake of a deadly attack on tourists in the disputed Kashmir region. It comes just days after Tehran offered to help ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Araghchi was welcomed by senior Pakistani officials after landing at an airport near Islamabad early on Monday. He is to meet his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar, as well as President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.",

      "description": "Cardinals hailing from 71 different countries will begin electing a pope this week in the most geographically diverse conclave in history. There is no rule that cardinals vote a certain way according to their nationality or region. But understanding their makeup in geographic terms can help explain some of their priorities. There are currently 135 cardinals who are under age 80 and eligible to vote in the conclave. Already two have formally told the Holy See that they cannot attend for health reasons, bringing the number of men who will enter the Sistine Chapel down to 133. A two-thirds majority is needed to be elected pope, meaning the winner must secure 89 votes.",

      "description": "Central Berlin was in ruins after the Red Army completed the Allied victory over the Nazis in an intense fight for the German capital in May 1945. After decades of division and its revival as the capital of a reunited, democratic Germany, the city is now transformed, blending painstakingly restored buildings with modern architecture. But the scars of the past remain visible in many places: facades riddled with bullet holes, or gaps in rows of houses sometimes plugged by new buildings. Berlin, the epicenter of Adolf Hitler\u2019s power, was the ultimate prize as the Allies closed in from east and west on the disintegrating German defenses in the final stage of World War II.",
