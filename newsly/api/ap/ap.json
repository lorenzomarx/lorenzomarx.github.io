      "description": "The House is heading towards a final vote on a bill to require the detainment of unauthorized migrants accused of theft and violent crimes. It marks the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration. The Laken Riley Act is named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man. Its passage would show just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump\u2019s election victory.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to deport \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of immigrants will hinge on securing money for detention centers. The Trump administration has not publicly said how many immigrant detention beds it needs to achieve its goals, or what the cost will be. However, an estimated 11.7 million people are living in the U.S. illegally. Immigration and Customs Enforcement currently has the budget to detain only about 41,000 people. Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico leverages the U.S. military to shore up mass deportations and provide \u201cappropriate detention space.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union estimates that ICE is considering an expansion of immigrant detention space across at least eight states.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump began his second administration with a blitz of policy actions to reorient U.S. government priorities. He has covered issues from trade, immigration and U.S. foreign aid to demographic diversity, civil rights and the hiring of federal workers. Some have an immediate policy impact. Others are more symbolic. Some already are being challenged by federal lawsuits. In total, the Republican president\u2019s sweeping actions reflect many of his campaign promises and determination to concentrate executive branch power in the West Wing, while moving the country sharply rightward.",
