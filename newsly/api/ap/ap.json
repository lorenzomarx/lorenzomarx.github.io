      "description": "On the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on dueling resolutions. One is Ukraine\u2019s European-backed proposal demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the country. The other is a U.S. resolution for a swift end to the war that never mentions Moscow\u2019s aggression. The Monday votes are a reflection of the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. General Assembly resolutions aren't legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",

The aspirations of the state\u2019s first lady have long been the subject of Tallahassee parlor talk.

The two sides were supposed to start negotiating a second phase weeks ago in which Hamas would release all the remaining hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. But those talks have hardly begun, and the first phase has been jolted by one dispute after another.",

The high court turned down the appeals in orders handed down Monday, though two conservative justices disagreed. Activists argued the laws barring people from protesting or trying to dissuade women from abortions should be struck down after the justices overturned Roe v. Wade. The cities defending the laws in Illinois and New Jersey said they were passed to address disturbing behavior from protesters outside of health care clinics.",

Trump welcomed Macron to the White House on Monday at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations. The Republican meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Trump has transformed American foreign policy and effectively tuned out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war. The \u201cAmerica First\u201d president has cast a shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and ex-government officials had regarded as America\u2019s calming presence of global stability.",

The AP is appearing in federal court in Washington over its emergency motion. It wants the court to undo the administration\u2019s move to shut its journalists out of the Oval Office, Air Force One and other areas. The dispute stems from the news agency\u2019s refusal to conform to Trump\u2019s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP says it is adhering to the \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d terminology because its audience is global and the waters are not only in U.S. territory, but it is acknowledging Trump\u2019s rechristening as well.",
