      "description": "A judge has rejected a Trump administration request to unseal transcripts from grand jury investigations of Jeffrey Epstein years ago in Florida. A similar records request is pending in New York. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said Wednesday the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public.",

      "description": "A judge is expected to order Bryan Kohberger to serve four life sentences without parole this week for brutally stabbing four University of Idaho students to death nearly three years ago. Wednesday\u2019s sentencing hearing will be an opportunity for the families of Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Kaylee Goncalves to tell the court and Kohberger about the anguish they\u2019ve felt since he broke into a home and killed their loved ones in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022. Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary in a deal that avoids the death penalty. He waived his right to appeal.",

The plan, disclosed Wednesday, focuses on boosting artificial intelligence technology exports, streamlining permits for energy-intensive data centers and exporting American AI around the world. Trump gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden\u2019s AI guardrails on his first day in office. Opponents of the Republican president's AI agenda argue it prioritizes the needs of Big Tech over people. More than 100 groups have come together to sign a resolution calling for a \u201cPeople's AI Action Plan\u201d that would preserve safeguards for the American public.",
