      "description": "The Trump administration is signaling a willingness to renew talks with Iran and avoid a prolonged war. That's in the aftermath of a surprise attack on three of Iran's nuclear sites as U.S. officials assess Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and the threat of retaliation against American interests. President Donald Trump's national security team spoke for him on Sunday. The coordinated messaging suggested a confidence that any fallout from the attack would be manageable and that Iran\u2019s lack of military capabilities would ultimately force it back to the bargaining table.",

The report, also carried by other Iranian media, offered no word on damage, nor who launched the assault on Monday. However, Israel has been conducted airstrikes throughout the day in Iran. The United States launched a major attack Sunday on three Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordo, which required the use of sophisticated bunker-buster bombs.",

The surprise assault caused his public support to plummet. Now, as Israel faces another unprecedented crisis in a war with Iran, Netanyahu appears rejuvenated. With the U.S. lending its support against a threat he has devoted his life to confronting, Netanyahu is demonstrating a resurgent confidence that could signal a new turning point in his lengthy political career. A veteran Israeli journalist said \"Netanyahu has proven that he is a phoenix.\u201d",

Just a week ago, things had seemed rosy. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was optimistic for an agreement to dedicate 5% of GDP to defense spending. Then Spain rejected the new target, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d The following day, Trump said that America should not have to respect the goal. On Sunday, he ordered the bombing of nuclear installations in Iran, which could dominate the summit. Questions also remain over Ukraine\u2019s place at the meeting.",

The attack Sunday on the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox church during a Divine Liturgy in Dweil\u2019a near Damascus was the first of its kind in Syria in years, and comes as Damascus under its de facto Islamist rule is trying to win the support of minorities. Father Fadi Ghattas told The Associated Press after the attack that some 350 people were praying at the church. No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the Syrian Interior Minister has blamed the extremist Islamic State group.",
