      "description": "President Donald Trump is holding off on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada for 30 days after the two U.S. neighbors agreed to boost border security efforts. Trump on Saturday had directed that 25% tariffs on most imports from the two American partners \u2014 and 10% on Canadian energy products \u2014 go into effect at midnight Tuesday. The two nations threatened retaliation of their own, raising the prospects of a broader regional trade war. In a statement on X, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that on a call with Trump he pledged additional cooperation on border security. It follows similar moves by Mexico earlier Monday. \u201cProposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together,\u201d Trudeau said.",

The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency fell to about $92,000 Sunday night before rebounding back over $100,000 Monday afternoon following Trump announcement of a pause on the tariffs on Mexican goods.",

      "description": "One of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances is broken. Canadians are absorbing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state. Canadians are feeling a sense of betrayal after Trump declared a trade war against America\u2019s northern neighbor and longtime ally. Trump keeps threatening Canada\u2019s sovereignty and vowing to put sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian products. The ties between the two countries are without parallel. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian, or US$2.5 billion, worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states and 77% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the United States.",

The emails sharply undercut assurances the Saints provided five years ago when they asserted they had provided only \u201cminimal\u201d assistance to the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Survivors of clergy abuse say they're disgusted by the team's involvement. The Saints said in a statement Saturday that the team does not condone sex abuse. They also criticized the media for using leaked emails to misconstrue what they called \u201ca well-intended effort.\u201d",

      "description": "A shortage of infantry troops and supply routes under Russian drone attacks have dealt a blow to Ukrainian forces around the strategic eastern city of Pokrovsk. The crucial supply hub lies at the confluence of highways leading to key cities in the Donetsk region. Ukrainian commanders say they do not have enough reserves to sustain defense lines and new recruits are unprepared and sometimes abandon positions. Heavy fog in recent days prevented Ukrainians from effectively using surveillance drones, allowing Russian troops to control dominant heights and take more territory.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. He's also claiming that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States. The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort are causing a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty. And they're threatening to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year\u2019s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. The tariffs are set to launch on Tuesday.",
