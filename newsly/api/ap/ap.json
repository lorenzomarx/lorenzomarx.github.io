      "description": "A federal judge has largely blocked sweeping executive orders from President Donald Trump that sought to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore found they likely violate free-speech rights and granted an injunction blocking them as a lawsuit plays out. Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts. The city of Baltimore and higher education groups sued, arguing the executive orders are unconstitutional and an overreach of presidential authority. The Trump administration has argued that the president was targeting only DEI programs that violate federal civil rights laws.",

It's citing freedom of speech in asking a federal judge to stop the 10-day blocking of its journalists. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

The move Friday sidelines a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a targeted campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks.

But Brown\u2019s future was called into question during the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s confirmation hearing for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",

Janet Mills told the Republican president, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court,\u201d over his push to deny federal funding to the state over allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports. Trump told the governor he looked forward to it, and predicted the end of her political career for opposing his order. Their exchange Friday came after Mills and Trump traded statements over the past 24 hours over his push to bar transgender athletes and evolved into an unusual breach of the typically courteous interactions that public officials, even of opposing parties, have historically shared at the White House.",
