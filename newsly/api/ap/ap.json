      "description": "Pope Francis has died. He was history\u2019s first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change. He was 88. The Vatican camerlengo made the announcement Monday. Francis suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man. He was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there. From his first greeting as pope of a simple \u201cGood evening\u201d to his embrace of refugees and the downtrodden, Francis signaled a very different tone for the papacy, stressing humility over hubris for a Catholic Church beset by scandal and accusations of indifference.",

      "description": "Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. Francis' death was announced by Cardinal Kevin Farrell. The Irish-born Vatican camerlengo's position will be important in the election of the next pope. Francis made his final public appearance a day earlier on Easter Sunday. Francis\u2019 death now sets off the process of allowing the faithful to pay their final respects. That will be followed by a funeral to be celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals and a conclave to elect a new pope.",

      "description": "Pope Francis understood the power of a simple touch. Some of the most iconic moments of his papacy were those when he interacted with the poor, the homeless and those seeking refuge from oppression. Francis died Monday at age 88 following a respiratory illness. History\u2019s first Latin American pope and the first to name himself after St. Francis of Assisi charmed the world with poignant acts of love, humility and informality. That began with his very first words as pontiff, emerging on the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and greeting the throngs with the words, \u201cGood evening.\u201d Francis eventually ran into troubles, with conservatives who were increasingly upset with his progressive leanings.",

A New York jury returned its verdict Monday in the trial of Nadine Menendez. Prosecutors say she was a key figure in a bribery scheme in which the powerful senator sold his clout to three New Jersey men looking for help with their business dealings or legal troubles. Nadine Menendez says she is innocent. Last year a different jury convicted Bob Menendez of many of the same charges. He is supposed to begin serving an 11-year prison term in June.",
