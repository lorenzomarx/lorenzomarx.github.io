      "description": "Russia said it intercepted more than 100 Ukrainian drones fired at almost a dozen of its regions in an attack that forced all four airports around Moscow to temporarily suspend flights. The overnight assault came two days ahead of a unilateral 72-hour ceasefire in the more than three-year war announced by President Vladimir Putin to coincide with celebrations in Moscow marking Victory Day in World War II. The day celebrating Moscow\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 is Russia\u2019s biggest secular holiday when foreign dignitaries will gather in the Russian capital.",

      "description": "Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out as a peculiar case. That's not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the U.S. but also for its complicated and uneasy history with its neighboring Asian giant, particularly the war history from the 20th century that overshadows politics of today. Its senior officials are visiting Washington and Beijing as Tokyo seeks a delicate balance, while its prime minister recently traveled to Vietnam and the Philippines in a rivalry with Beijing.",

      "description": "Conservative leader Friedrich Merz\u2019s bid to become Germany\u2019s 10th chancellor has failed in the first round of voting in parliament. Merz had been expected to win smoothly in the vote on Tuesday. A candidate for chancellor has never failed to win on the first ballot in post-World War II Germany. Merz needed a majority of 316 out of 630 votes in a secret ballot but only received 310 votes. The lower house of parliament has 14 days to elect a candidate with an absolute majority. Merz can run again, but other lawmakers can also throw their hat in the ring.",

Palestinians are exhausted and hopeless, pummeled by 19 months of heavy bombing. Families of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza are terrified that the possibility of a ceasefire is slipping further away. Israeli officials said Monday that Cabinet ministers approved the plan to seize Gaza and remain in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time. Details of the plan were not formally announced. It may be another measure by Israel to try to pressure Hamas into making concessions in ceasefire negotiations.",

The deep cuts are part of what the Trump administration says is an effort to promote efficiency but that critics worry could result in a more politicized force.

In a memo dated Monday, he said the cuts will remove \u201credundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership.\u201d The Pentagon is under pressure to slash spending and personnel as part of the broader federal government cuts pushed by President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",

The South Asian country has been under a government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in a students-led mass uprising in August last year. Zia, Hasina\u2019s archrival, and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party have been pushing Yunu\u2019s government to hold a national election in December to return the country to democratic rule.

      "description": "Cardinals electing a new pope have some fundamental questions to weigh, beyond whether to give the Catholic Church its first Asian or African pope. Despite hailing from 70 different countries, the 133 cardinals seem fundamentally united in finding a pope who will be able to make the 2,000-year-old church credible and relevant today, especially to young people. That's a tall task, given the sexual abuse and financials scandals that have sullied the church\u2019s reputation. Add to that the Holy See\u2019s dire financial state and often-dysfunctional bureaucracy, and the job of being pope in the 21st century seems almost impossible.

The German War Graves Commission works to exhume and rebury the dead with dignity \u2014 regardless of the army they served. There are more than 2 million German soldiers still unaccounted for. The effort continues across former battlefields, including in Ukraine. The Volksbund sees the work as a moral obligation, even as most families are no longer actively searching for lost relatives.
