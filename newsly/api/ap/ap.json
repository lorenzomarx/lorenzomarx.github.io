U.S.-led ceasefire efforts appear to be gaining momentum after nearly 21 months of war as Israel's prime minister visits the White House on Monday. Weary Palestinians expressed cautious hope Saturday after Hamas gave a \u201cpositive\u201d response to the latest U.S. proposal for a 60-day truce. But the militant group said further talks are needed on implementation.

At least 23 people were injured, and multiple residential buildings in the capital were damaged. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 270 targets and another 208 targets were lost from radar and presumed jammed, but dozens still struck or caused damage across the city.

The attack came hours after President Donald Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and made his first public comments on the U.S. decision to pause some shipments of weapons to Ukraine.",

      "description": "Donald Trump has made tax cuts a central part of his political legacy. There were his first-term cuts. And now the Republican has pushed through an extension of those cuts and added new tax breaks. But the bill he signed into law Friday also comes with significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, contradicting promises to protect such programs. Democrats plan to make that expected fallout a campaign focus, while Republicans argue the bill will boost the economy. Historically, major legislation that's been backed mostly by just one party has rarely translated into political rewards. So the long-term effects of Trump\u2019s tax policy are unclear.",
