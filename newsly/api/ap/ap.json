      "description": "U.S. and Chinese officials say they have reached a deal to roll back most of their recent tariffs and call a 90 day pause so they can keep talking to resolve their trade disputes. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Monday the U.S. has agreed to drop its 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods by 115 percentage points to 30%, while China has agreed to lower its rate on U.S. goods by the same amount to 10%. Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the tariff reductions at a news conference in Geneva. They say the two sides have set up consultations to continue discussing their trade issues. The announcement by the U.S. and China sent shares surging.",

In a statement, Hamas did not immediately disclose further details about the release expected on Monday. Hamas had announced on Sunday that it would free Edan Alexander as a good will gesture for the Trump administration. Alexander, an Israeli soldier, was taken captive on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli authorities earlier acknowledged Alexander's planned release, without saying when it would happen. It would be the first hostage release since Israel shattered an 8-week ceasefire with Hamas.",

The savings are needed to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. But it's setting off the biggest political fight over health care since Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, during Trump\u2019s first term in 2017 \u2014 which ended in failure. While Republicans insist they are simply rooting out \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d to generate health care savings, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.",
