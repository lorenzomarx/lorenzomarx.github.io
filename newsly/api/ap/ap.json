      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests. The proposal, which was at the center of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks. Zelenskyy\u2019s decision to reject a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",

      "description": "Ukraine boasts vast reserves of ilmenite, a key element used to produce titanium, in the heavy mineral sands that stretch for miles along the country\u2019s embattled east. Much of it is underdeveloped because of war as well as onerous state policies. That is poised to change if U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration agrees to a deal with Ukraine to exchange critical minerals for continued American military aid. But many unknowns stand in the way of turning these riches into profit: cost, licensing terms and whether such a deal will be underpinned by security guarantees.",

Hundreds of protesters held placards Saturday that read \u201cThank God for President Trump\u201d and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority. Many were from the white Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the South African government.",

Officials have offered few details about their cross-country investigation, but police and court records, interviews and online postings point to a small group of young computer scientists portrayed as highly intelligent and increasingly violent. Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence. The dead include Border Patrol Agent David Maland, two members of the group, the parents of another member and a California landlord who tried to evict some of them.",

Water has submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides have blocked roads in Virginia. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service has warned residents to stay off the roads. Forecasters also have predicted weekend snowstorms in the Northeast and the threat of tornadoes for the Mississippi Valley. Heavy snow is expected to blanket much of New England.
