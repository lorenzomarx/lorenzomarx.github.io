      "description": "President Donald Trump has blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives. His comments caused outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger Russian military. Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator without elections\u201d and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from Russia, and some of what Trump has said does echo Russia\u2019s own narrative of the conflict.",

      "description": "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says U.S. President Donald Trump is living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space\u201d as a result of his administration\u2019s discussions with Kremlin officials. Trump suggested Tuesday that Ukraine was to blame for the war on its territory, which enters its fourth year next week. Zelenskyy spoke as Trump's envoy, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv for talks. Talks between top American and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday sidelined Ukraine and its European supporters. Trump\u2019s comments marked a major shift in U.S. policy after years of efforts to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and are likely to vex Ukrainian officials.",

      "description": "NATO members are continuing their largest combat exercises of 2025 amid concern within the 32-nation alliance over its most powerful member, the United States. The drills in Romania come as a shaken Europe grapples with a new U.S. course under President Donald Trump. His defense secretary has demanded that allies dramatically ramp up military spending and said U.S. security priorities lie elsewhere. That cast doubts on Washington\u2019s longstanding security guarantees provided to Europe. The NATO exercises also come days before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

The rhetoric from Trump toward Ukraine comes amid an escalating back-and-forth between the two presidents and rising tensions between the United States and much of Europe over Trump\u2019s approach to settling the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II. Trump\u2019s broadside came not long after Zelenskyy\u2019s comment that Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he tries to bring the fighting to a close on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow.",

      "description": "Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Elizabeth Clement says she will step down from the court by April 30. Wednesday's announcement of the upcoming resignation opens the door for Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to make an appointment that would leave Democratic-backed justices holding a 6-1 court majority. Clement did not give a reason for her decision. She was originally appointed to the court in 2017 by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. While Supreme Court positions are nonpartisan in Michigan, nominations go through the political parties. Currently, Democratic-nominated justices hold a 5-2 majority on the court after they picked up one seat in the November election.",

But Trump and Musk weren't always friends. And it's often those once closest to Trump often end up as his fiercest critics.",

Video images of the plane landing hard on the runway, catching fire and flipping upside down raised questions about how anyone could have survived. But experts say advances in aviation technology have resulted in design features such as wings that can easily detach, which is important in a crash since fuel tanks are stored there. The seats, too, are built to withstand intense pressure and flight crews train repeatedly for scenarios similar to what happened Monday at Toronto Pearson International Airport.",
