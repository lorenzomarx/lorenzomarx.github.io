      "description": "Yemen's Houthi rebels say U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port have killed 20 people and wounded 50 others. The strikes were confirmed by the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which did not acknowledge any casualties. The airstrikes represent one of the highest death tolls so far in the campaign launched under President Donald Trump that has involved hundreds of strikes since March 15. Central Command said U.S. forces acted to eliminate fuel for the Houthis and deprive them of illegal revenue.",

      "description": "The world's largest immigration detention system is on the cusp of explosive growth as President Donald Trump pursues his signature campaign promise of mass deportations. The deportations represent a potential bonanza for private prison companies and a challenge to the government agencies responsible for the orderly expulsion of immigrants. Some critics say the administration\u2019s plans also include a deliberate attempt to isolate detainees by locking them up and holding court proceedings far from their attorneys and support systems. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is starting to scale up from its current budget for about 41,000 beds to 100,000 beds.",

      "description": "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals. The mine in California can\u2019t meet the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is pushing for new mines. Rare earth elements are ingredients in electric vehicles, advanced fighter jets, smartphones and many other products. They aren\u2019t actually rare, but it\u2019s hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment. Experts say prices are likely to increase quickly if China extends its import controls but there is likely enough of a stockpile to keep factories operating for now.",

Investigators say the son of a sheriff\u2019s deputy opened fire with his mother\u2019s former service weapon.

Trump\u2019s executive order to end birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally has been halted nationwide by three district courts around the country. The Republican administration had sought to narrow those orders to allow for the policy to take effect in parts or most of the country. That is expected to be the focus of the high court arguments under the court's order Thursday.",

That's according to officials in Belize and the U.S. After the plane carrying 14 passengers and two crew members landed safely on Thursday, police in Belize identified the man as Akinyela Taylor. Chester Williams, Belize police commissioner, said that Taylor wielded a knife and stabbed three people on the plane. The three were later taken to a hospital. A passenger licensed to carry firearms shot the hijacker. A U.S. Embassy spokesperson confirmed Taylor was a U.S. citizen but U.S. officials could not confirm a Belize commissioner's statement that he was a military veteran. The hijacker's motive was not immediately known.",
