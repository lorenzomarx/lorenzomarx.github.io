      "description": "The Trump administration is asking federal agencies to cancel remaining contracts with Harvard University worth about $100 million. That's according to a senior administration official Tuesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations. The government already has canceled more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants for the Ivy League school, which has pushed back on the administration\u2019s demands for changes to several of its policies. Cuts to contracts could take away millions more from Harvard\u2019s budget.",

The emergency appeal Tuesday came after a judge found the White House violated a court order with a deportation flight to the chaotic African nation carrying people from other countries who had been convicted of crimes in the U.S. Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston found that the White House had \u201cunquestionably\u201d violated his earlier order that people must be given a chance to raise objections before being sent to another country that would put them in danger, even if they\u2019ve otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.",

Palestinians overwhelmed a center distributing food on Tuesday, breaking through fences. An AP journalist heard tank and gunfire from nearby Israeli troops and saw a military helicopter firing flares. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the center to bring the situation under control. At least three injured Palestinians were seen being brought from the scene. The distribution hub outside Rafah had been opened the day before by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been slated by Israel to take over aid operations despite opposition from the U.N. and other humanitarian organizations.",

In a 58-second video posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed COVID-19 shots from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video. U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. A CDC scientific advisory panel is set to meets in June and will consider recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot. But Kennedy decided not to wait.",
