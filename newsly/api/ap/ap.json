      "description": "Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s ability to carry out President Donald Trump's \u201cplay call\u201d for funding the government is being put to the test. The House is holding a procedural vote Tuesday on a bill that would end the partial government shutdown. Johnson will need near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed. The legislation funds most of the federal government through Sept. 30 and the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks as lawmakers negotiate potential changes for the agency that enforces the nation\u2019s immigration laws, often referred to as ICE. Trump urged lawmakers to back the bill in a social media post.",

      "description": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have finalized an agreement with House Republicans to testify this month in a House investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. They bowed to the threat of a contempt of Congress vote against them. Hillary Clinton will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 26. Bill Clinton will appear on Feb. 27. It will mark the first time that lawmakers have compelled a former president to testify.

The British government says newly released Epstein files include documents that suggest Mandelson may have shared market-sensitive information with the convicted sex offender while Mandelson was a member of the British government a decade and a half ago. The Metropolitan Police force said detectives had reviewed reports of misconduct and decided they met the threshold for a full investigation. Misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.",

It's a sign tensions have not eased since the departure of a high-profile commander. At least one person wearing an anti-ICE message was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests. There was no immediate response from the Department of Homeland Security. A federal judge ordered officers not to arrest motorists who are following but not obstructing their operations, but an appeals court set the order aside. Meanwhile, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to welcome Colombian President Gustavo Petro to the White House for talks. Tuesday's meeting comes weeks after Trump accused the Colombian leader of pumping cocaine into the United States and threatened military action against his South American country. U.S. administration officials say the meeting will focus on regional security cooperation and counternarcotics efforts. Bad blood between the leaders looms large ahead of the sit-down. Trump, on the heels of an operation to capture Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, warned Petro last month that he could be next. The conservative Trump and leftist Petro are ideologically far apart, but both leaders share a tendency for verbal bombast and unpredictability. That's giving the visit an anything-could-happen vibe.",
