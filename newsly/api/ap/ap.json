      "description": "The National Governors Association is pulling out of an annual meeting at the White House after President Donald Trump declined to invite two Democratic governors. The Republican president is still expected to meet with governors at the White House on Friday but the event won't be facilitated by the governors' group. Trump had refused to include Democratic Jared Polis of Colorado and Wes Moore of Maryland and he recently blasted them on social media as \u201cnot worthy of being there.\u201d The episode underscores the confrontational approach Trump has taken during his second term toward state leaders he doesn't like.",

      "description": "Iran held annual military drills with Russia as a second American aircraft carrier drew closer to the Middle East. Both the United States and Iran are signaling they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program fizzle out. President Donald Trump said Thursday he believes 10 to 15 days is enough time for Iran to reach a deal. But talks on its nuclear program have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups. Indirect talks held in recent weeks made little visible progress, and one or both sides could be buying time for final war preparations.",

The buildup is happening as President Donald Trump warns of possible military action against Iran if talks over its nuclear program fall apart. Trump likely will have a host of military options. They could include surgical attacks on Iran\u2019s air defenses or strikes focused on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But experts warn that Iran could retaliate in ways it hadn\u2019t following attacks last year by the U.S. or Israel. They say military actions against Iran could potentially risk American lives and spark a regional war.",

Because of the turmoil, 12-time convicted felon Cory Allen McKay caught a break. He was scheduled to stand trial next month on methamphetamine trafficking charges that could have locked him up for 25 years. Instead, he walked free after the prosecutor on his case retired. The diminished U.S. attorney's office has been forced to dismiss some cases, kill others before charges are filed and seek plea agreements and delays. Local officials worry the office will be unable to bring charges against some of the state\u2019s most serious offenders.",

Principal Alonna McMullen says it was heartbreaking telling 5 and 6 year old students in Linda Davis' special needs classes of her death. The crash happened Monday less than a half mile from the school where Davis taught in Savannah's southern suburbs. Authorities say the driver was a Guatemalan man who crashed after running a stoplight to evade immigration officers seeking to detain him on a judge's deportation order. McMullen said Davis had an upbeat personality and a determination to ensure all of her students thrived.",

Colbert's pulled interview with Talarico put more of a spotlight on their race. Crockett rallied supporters at multiple stops around the Dallas area on Thursday.",
