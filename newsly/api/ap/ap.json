      "description": "Hope of finding survivors of the catastrophic flooding in Texas is dimming a day after the death toll surpassed 100. But crews have kept up the search for people missing in the aftermath. The search efforts benefited Tuesday from improving weather. The storms that battered the Hill Country for the past four days began to lighten up, although isolated pockets of heavy rain were still possible. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott planned to make another visit Tuesday to Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died during the flash floods. Officials said Monday that 10 campers and one counselor have still not been found.",

      "description": "Intense rainstorms are becoming more frequent in most of the U.S. \u2014 though experts say where they occur and whether they cause catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance. More than 100 people died in Texas Hill Country over the weekend after 12 inches of rain fell in just hours. Last year, Hurricane Helene dumped more than 30 inches of rain on western North Carolina, where flooding killed 108. Experts say human-caused climate change is setting the stage because a hotter atmosphere holds more water. But it\u2019s impossible to predict where flooding will occur in any given year.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday set a 25% tax on goods imported from Japan and South Korea, as well as new tariff rates on a dozen other countries. Trump provided notice of the tariffs to begin on Aug. 1 by posting letters on Truth Social that were addressed to the leaders of the various countries. The letters warned them to not retaliate by increasing their own import taxes, or else the Trump administration would further increase import taxes. The higher tariffs could hinder economic growth, if not increase recession risks.",

      "description": "The Israeli military says five soldiers were killed in an attack in northern Gaza, while health officials in the Palestinian territory say 18 people were killed in Israeli strikes. The bloodshed came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting the White House for talks with President Donald Trump about a ceasefire plan to pause the Gaza fighting. While there was no announcement of a breakthrough from that meeting, there were signs of progress toward a deal. The killings of the soldiers could add to the pressure on Netanyahu to strike a deal in Israel, where polls have shown widespread support for ending the war.",

On Tuesday, authorities reported an ongoing assault on the Liberian-flagged ship Eternity C, leaving two crew members injured and two missing. The attack followed a similar strike on Sunday, where the rebels sank another vessel, Magic Seas, forcing its crew to abandon ship. These incidents mark a return to Houthi aggression against shipping after a pause since March. The attacks threaten trade routes and could escalate tensions involving U.S. and Western forces in the region.",

That's according to two senior officials and a cable sent last week to all embassies and consulates.

The recipients of the scam messages, which were sent by text, Signal and voice mail, were not identified in the cable. A copy was shared with The Associated Press.",

      "description": "Filmmaker Peter Jackson's fascination with a large extinct New Zealand bird has led to an unusual partnership with a biotech company known for its grand and controversial plans to bring back lost species. Colossal Biosciences on Tuesday announced an effort to genetically engineer living birds to resemble the extinct South Island giant moa with $15 million in funding from Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh. Outside scientists say the idea of bringing back extinct species onto the modern landscape is likely impossible, although it may be feasible to tweak the genes of living animals to have similar physical traits.",

The Transportation Security Administration is looking to abandon the requirement, according to media reports.
