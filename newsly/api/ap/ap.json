      "description": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met with Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz ahead of his meeting with President Donald Trump. Modi also met Thursday with Trump administration official Elon Musk. Modi has heaped praise on Trump and hopes to avoid additional tariffs the new Republican administration has slapped on other countries. But that didn't stop Trump from signing an order increasing U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports. That move affects American trading partners around the world, including India. Trump also has decried U.S. trade deficits internationally \u2014 and the U.S. has a large one with India.",

      "description": "Tariffs are in the news at the moment. But what are they? Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs.",

      "description": "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected. Wednesday\u2019s consumer price index report showed that Trump could end up facing the same challenges that dragged down his predecessor, President Joe Biden. The annual inflation rate has risen over the three months since the November election to 3%. Gasoline prices in particular have climbed despite Trump\u2019s claims that his return to the presidency would signal increased oil production that would lower energy costs. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that even U.S. presidents are subject to the invisible hand of supply and demand, rather than the masters of it.",
