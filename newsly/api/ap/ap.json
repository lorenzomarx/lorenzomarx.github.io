      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to meet with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland to discuss trade. Both sides are seeking an agreement on tariff rates. Trump played golf Saturday at his course in Turnberry and plans to visit another one in Aberdeen, where his family is opening a new Trump course. The meeting Sunday with von der Leyen is expected to be private. Trump mentioned a 50-50 chance of reaching a deal with the EU. The U.S. had threatened a 30% tariff rate on the EU and Trump has set a deadline for Friday. Without a deal, the EU could retaliate with tariffs on American products.",

      "description": "The Israeli military has intercepted a Gaza-bound aid ship, detaining 21 international activists and journalists and seizing all cargo, including baby formula, food, and medicine, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. The coalition says the military \"violently intercepted\" the ship in international waters about 40 nautical miles from Gaza just before midnight Saturday.

The ship's interception comes as Israel faces mounting international criticism over the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.
