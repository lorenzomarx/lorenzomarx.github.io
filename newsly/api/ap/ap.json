      "description": "The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving improper Social Security payments. Over the past few days, President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits. Musk called it a \u201cHUGE problem,\u201d as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste, fraud and abuse. It is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",

      "description": "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new health secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, favor stripping such treats from the program previously known as food stamps. The $113 billion SNAP program helps about 42 million low-income Americans pay for nutritious food. Such changes have been proposed many times in past decades, but never approved. But policy experts say this moment could be different. Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to win waivers.",

While orders were sometimes softened or even ignored during his first term, this time he's unwilling to let things slide. The White House summarizes Trump\u2019s approach with the mantra \u201cpromises made, promises kept.\u201d Administration officials also say Trump is entitled to impose his vision on the government that he was elected to lead.

The 36-year-old Rocky could\u2019ve legally gotten up to 24 years in prison with guilty verdicts. He took a major gamble when he turned down a plea deal that could have meant just six months in jail.

Trump\u2019s comments marked a major shift in U.S. policy after years of efforts to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and are likely to vex Ukrainian officials.",

They have traveled by car and on foot, through muddy olive groves and snipers\u2019 sight lines, in the occupied territory's largest displacement since the 1967 Mideast war. After announcing a widespread crackdown against West Bank militants on Jan. 21, Israeli forces descended on the city of Jenin, as they have dozens of times since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Soldiers then pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby towns, scattering families and stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over Israel\u2019s creation. During that war, 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what Palestinians call the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d",
