      "description": "Iran and the United States are poised Friday to hold negotiations in Oman at least over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. The talks follow a chaotic week that initially saw plans for regional countries to take part in talks in Turkey. Previous rounds of meetings turned to ash following Israel\u2019s launch of a 12-day war against Iran back in June. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war. Meanwhile, nationwide protests have shaken Iran's theocracy. It responded with a bloody crackdown that killed thousands and reportedly saw tens of thousands arrested. President Donald Trump has threatened to strike the country in the time since, spurring the talks.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump claims his tariffs have revived the U.S. economy, calling it an \u201cAmerican economic miracle.\u201d He argues that tariffs have boosted growth and reduced inflation. However, the facts tell a different story. The U.S. economy was already growing before his second term. During the first three quarters of the year, Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 delivered mixed results for the American economy. Inflation figures are skewed by data disruptions, and tariffs have actually increased core goods prices. Trump also claims foreign producers bear most tariff costs, but studies show U.S. consumers and firms are affected.",

Thousands of children are staying home, often for lack of door-to-door transportation \u2014 or simply trust that they'll make it to school. For some families, the fear has turned into reality. Many parents and at least some children have been detained. Schools, parents and community groups have mobilized to help students get to class so they can learn, socialize and have consistent access to two meals.",

The filmmaker, his wife and Epstein were neighbors in New York City. Records show the three dined together often. They also commiserated with each other about being accused of sexual misconduct. One year, Epstein used his connections to a former member of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration to help Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, get a White House tour. A message sent to an assistant for Allen and Previn via email seeking comment wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
