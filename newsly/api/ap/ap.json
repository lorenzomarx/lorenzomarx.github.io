      "description": "Recent aviation disasters and close calls definitely have people worried about the safety of flying. The midair collision that killed 67 near Washington and the fiery plane crash in Philadelphia and now a missing plane in Alaska are only the most high-profile disasters. There was also a plane that clipped a parked plane while taxiing at the Seattle airport earlier this week and a United Airlines plane that caught fire during takeoff at the Houston airport. But even with all these incidents the statistics show that flying remains the safest form of transportation compared with driving or even riding on a train.",

The Trump administration is seeking to ensure Adams' cooperation with its immigration crackdown. The bargain has raised new questions about the mayor\u2019s political independence and ability to lead the city. In a statement Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker.",

Shortly before the meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump, but Macron\u2019s office would not disclose details about the 20-minute discussion. European leaders have been stunned by a weeklong diplomatic blitz on Ukraine from the Trump administration that seemed to embrace the Kremlin while it cold-shouldered many of its age-old European allies. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, underlined Monday that Europe has no place at the negotiating table.",

It would be the most significant meeting between the sides since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor nearly three years ago. The talks are scheduled for Tuesday in Saudi Arabia. They mark another consequential step by the Trump administration to reverse U.S. policy on isolating Russia, and are meant to pave the way for a meeting between U.S. and Russian presidents. The moves have sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won\u2019t be favorable to them. France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K.",
