      "description": "The risk of life-threatening flooding is still high in central Texas with more rain on the way. The urgent search for the missing continues following a holiday weekend deluge that killed at least 82 people including children at summer camps. Officials say the death toll is sure to rise. Gov. Greg Abbott says more than 40 people are unaccounted for. Searchers now have found 68 bodies in Kerr County, where a wall of water came down the Guadalupe River. Sheriff Larry Leitha says the dead include 28 children. Abbott warned Sunday that additional rounds of heavy rains lasting into Tuesday could produce more flash flooding.",

      "description": "Former federal officials and outside experts have warned for months that President Donald Trump\u2019s staffing cuts to the National Weather Service could endanger lives. After torrential rains and flash flooding struck Friday in the Texas Hill Country, the weather service came under fire from local officials who criticized what they described as inadequate forecasts. Democrats wasted little time linking staff reductions to the disaster, which is being blamed for the deaths of at least 80 people. Former federal officials and experts have said Trump\u2019s indiscriminate job reductions at NWS and other weather-related agencies will result in brain drain that threatens the government\u2019s ability to issue timely and accurate forecasts. Trump said job cuts did not hamper weather forecasts.",

      "description": "Flash floods in Texas have killed nearly 70 people, many of them children. An unknown number of people are missing. Heavy rains fell quickly in the predawn hours Friday in the Texas Hill Country, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Among the missing are 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp. Officials are resisting estimating the total number of missing. The July Fourth holiday weekend likely brought an influx of visitors to the area outside San Antonio, making it difficult to track all the people who may have been in the area.",

The attacks came after a suspected Houthi attack targeting a ship in the Red Sea that caught fire and took on water, later forcing its crew to abandon the vessel. The Israeli military said it struck Houthi-held ports at Hodeida, Ras Isa and Salif. The Houthis then responded with an apparent missile attack on Israel. The Israeli military said it attempted to intercept the missile, but it appeared to make impact, though there were no immediate reports of injuries from the attack.",

The Chapel Hill Fire Department and neighboring agencies completed more than 50 water rescues, many of them in areas where floodwaters entered or threatened to enter apartments. Chapel Hill officials said Monday that more than 60 people were displaced Sunday and Monday. In Orange County, the possibility of the failure of the Lake Michael Dam prompted officials to issue a voluntary evacuation for areas downstream. In Chatham County, Sheriff Mike Roberson warned residents that water may have subsided in some areas, but it was still dangerous to travel. He says officials were searching for some missing persons.",
