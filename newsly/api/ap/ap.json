      "description": "Many U.S. adults believe the federal government is overspending. But polling also shows many Americans, including Republicans, think the country is spending too little on major government programs like Social Security. The polls from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research come as President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk push for extensive cuts throughout the federal government, slashing funding for humanitarian aid and turning their attention to the Department of Education and the military. The polls suggest Americans may not agree with where the Republican administration\u2019s cuts should fall. A January AP-NORC poll shows about two-thirds of Americans say the government is spending \u201ctoo little\u201d on Social Security and education.",

      "description": "A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift a funding freeze shutting down U.S. humanitarian aid and development worldwide. Judge Amir Ali's order Thursday gives the Republican administration five days to show it\u2019s complying. The judge cites the financial devastation that the sudden funding cutoff has caused suppliers and nonprofits that help the U.S. carry out aid programs overseas. Contractors, farmers and suppliers in the U.S. and around the world say the Trump administration\u2019s funding freeze has stiffed them on hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump says the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, and much of foreign assistance overall is out of line with his agenda.",

Now home in Israel, they are confronting a flood of information about loved ones and destroyed communities, and are still figuring out their place in a changed world. Their families are grappling with how to fill them in on what they missed without potentially deepening their trauma. One hostage forced to speak at a staged Hamas ceremony before his release told a crowd of masked militants and journalists that he was looking forward to seeing his wife and two teenage daughters. It wasn't until he arrived back in Israel that he learned the crushing reality: all three had been killed during the Oct. 7 attack.",
