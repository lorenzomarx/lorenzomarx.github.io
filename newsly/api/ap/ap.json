      "description": "A federal judge is set to hear arguments Monday on whether to pause an immigration crackdown in Minnesota. This follows the fatal shootings of two people by government officers. The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security two weeks ago. They want to restore conditions before the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge began in December. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison plans to attend the hearing. Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit legally frivolous. The case could have implications for other states facing similar immigration enforcement operations like that underway in Minnesota.",

      "description": "The fatal shooting of Minneapolis man Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers has sparked calls for an independent investigation. The Trump administration has launched three federal probes, but details remain unclear. Tensions are high in Minneapolis, with conflicting narratives about the incident. The FBI is assisting in processing evidence, but there\u2019s no indication their Civil Rights Division intends to investigate Pretti\u2019s case. The incident highlights mistrust between state officials and the Trump administration over the investigation. Minnesota's governor, in a call with President Donald Trump, said he called for impartial investigations.",

      "description": "The Northeastern U.S. is getting the last brunt of a massive winter storm that dumped snow, sleet and ice across much of the southern and eastern U.S. over the weekend. The colossal storm halted air and road traffic in many areas and sent temperatures plunging. As the work week began, the heaviest snow was falling from New York northward into New England. That's after heavy ice snapped branches and power lines in the South, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without electricity. In the meantime, arctic air was spreading in behind the storm and some communities in New York saw record-breaking subzero temperatures.",

The Bombardier Challenger 600 crashed around 7:45 p.m. Sunday. There was no immediate word on the conditions of those aboard and an airport statement said the airport was closed and emergency crews were at the site. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The crash occurred as New England and much of the country grappled with a massive winter storm. Bangor had steady snowfall Sunday like much of the northeastern United States.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he is increasing tariffs on South Korean goods because the country\u2019s national assembly has yet to approve the trade framework announced last year. Trump said on social media Monday that import taxes would be raised on autos, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs from South Korea with the rate on other goods going from 15% to 25%. The U.S. president previously imposed the tariffs by declaring an economic emergency and bypassing Congress, while South Korea needed legislative approval for the framework announced in July and affirmed during Trump\u2019s October visit to the country. The threat was a reminder that the tariff drama unleashed last year by Trump is likely to be repeated again and again this year.",

Instead, the investigators on Tuesday will detail all the things they found that played a role in the crash near Washington, D.C., and the board will recommend changes that should be made to help prevent a similar event from happening again. Family members of the victims hope those suggestions won\u2019t be ignored the same way many past NTSB recommendations have been after other crashes.",

The scrutiny from Brussels comes after Grok sparked backlash by using AI to undress people, including children, in images. Sme governments have banned the service or issued warnings. The EU's executive is examining whether X has met its obligations under the Digital Services Act to contain illegal content. An X spokeswoman said the platform remains committed to safety and has zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity.",
