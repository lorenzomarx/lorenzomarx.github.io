      "description": "The Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to strip legal protections from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The court\u2019s order Monday, with only one noted dissent, puts on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept in place Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans that would have otherwise expired last month. The status allows people already in the United States to live and work legally because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that his decision to resume aid to Gaza came from pressure from allies. In a video statement posted to social media, Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel\u2019s allies had voiced concern about \u201cimages of hunger\u201d and said they told the country that \u201cwith that, we will not be able to support you.\u201d Netanyahu said the aid that would be let in would be \u201cminimal,\u201d without specifying precisely when it would resume. Israel on Sunday said it would resume aid deliveries into the war-battered territory after a complete halt on imports since early March.",

      "description": "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease. One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease. Now the former president is facing his own diagnosis. Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. Biden wrote on social media that \u201ccancer touches us all.\u201d He had made increasing cancer research a priority for his administration.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is hoping separate phone calls with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will make progress toward a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. Trump expressed his hopes for a \u201cproductive day\u201d Monday \u2014 and a ceasefire \u2014 in a social media post over the weekend. His effort will also include calls to NATO leaders. Trump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022. That makes these conversations a serious test of his reputation as a dealmaker after having claimed he'd quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, or even before he took office.",

Trump will attend the GOP\u2019s weekly conference meeting on Tuesday. That's according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans not yet made public. Republicans can afford only a few defections to get the bill through the House, and differences remain. Some deficit hawks are insisting on quicker cuts to Medicaid and green energy programs before giving their full support. Others are seeking a large increase in the state and local tax deduction.",

There will be a new topic as well when NFL owners gather Tuesday and Wednesday at the headquarters of the Minnesota Vikings. The league has proposed allowing its players to participate in flag football when the sport makes its Olympic debut in Los Angeles in 2028. Owners were set to vote on Philadelphia's famous tush push last month, but tabled the issue. The league also is discussing using records for playoff seeding rather than guaranteeing higher seeds for division champions.",
