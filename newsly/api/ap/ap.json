      "description": "South Korea\u2019s new President Lee Jae-myung says he\u2019ll pursue dialogue with North Korea while bolstering a trilateral partnership with the U.S. and Japan. He said in his inaugural address after taking office Wednesday that his government will deal with potential North Korean aggressions with \u201ca strong deterrence\u201d based on the solid South Korea-U.S. military alliance. But he would also leave the door open for dialogue with North Korea and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula. He said he\u2019ll pursue pragmatic diplomacy and boost a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation based on the South Korea-U.S. alliance. Lee won a snap election Tuesday for a five-year term.",

      "description": "Members of the Boulder community are reeling from a firebombing attack that injured 12 people demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages. Residents are preparing to come together for a vigil Wednesday evening to support those impacted. Authorities say Mohamed Sabry Soliman had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday\u2019s attack in which he yelled \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d Officials say he had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in the demonstration. Soliman is an Egyptian national who has been living in the U.S. illegally. He faces federal hate crime and state attempted murder charges. Federal officials say his wife and five children have been taken into custody and could be quickly deported.",

The army said it fired \u201cnear a few individual suspects\u201d who left the designated route, approached its forces and ignored warning shots. The near-daily shootings have come after an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation established aid distribution points inside Israeli military zones, a system it says is designed to circumvent Hamas. The United Nations has rejected the new system, saying it doesn\u2019t address Gaza\u2019s mounting hunger crisis and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of casualties on Tuesday.",

And that led to a police raid that failed to recapture him. A senior law enforcement official says authorities were so convinced about the authenticity of the videos that they carried out a search late Monday of a New Orleans home in which they believe they were filmed. The official said Massey was not at the home, but authorities did locate some clothing they believe he wore during the filming. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.",

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington said Tuesday a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications the bureau's own medical staff deems appropriate. The judge says the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s order are trying to lessen the anguish caused by their gender dysphoria. The Republican president\u2019s order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so federal funds aren\u2019t spent for \"conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
