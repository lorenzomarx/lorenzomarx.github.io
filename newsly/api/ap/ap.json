The service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta was one of many planned across the country on Monday's holiday in King's honor. the Rev. Bernice King, King's daughter, said anti-woke rhetoric is being used to divide and distract people from real issues of injustice. The U.S. was also set to inaugurate President-elect Donald Trump back into office Monday. The juxtaposition was uneasy for civil rights leaders who have opposed Trump\u2019s rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights.",

      "description": "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app\u2019s savior. The developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",

Both Israelis and Palestinians are torn between celebration and trepidation as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took hold Sunday. The skies above Gaza and Israel were silent for the first time in over a year, and Palestinians began returning to what was left of the homes. After months of tight Israeli restrictions, more than 600 trucks carrying humanitarian aid rolled into the devastated territory. The ceasefire has stirred modest hopes for ending the Israel-Hamas war. But many questions and more challenging negotiations are ahead.",

Trump made mass deportations a signature issue of his campaign and has promised a raft of orders to remake immigration policy when he takes office Monday. Plans for deportation arrests appear to be in flux after news leaked of an operation in Chicago this week. Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan said on Fox News Sunday that Chicago was not off the table, but officials were reconsidering when and how to conduct enforcement. So-called sanctuary cities such as Chicago, which limit how local police cooperate with federal immigration authorities, have been a favorite Trump target.",
