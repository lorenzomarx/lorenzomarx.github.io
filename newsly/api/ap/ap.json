      "description": "A senior cardinal has urged the cardinals voting in a conclave to elect a pope who prizes unity in diversity, and puts personal interests aside.Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the dean of the College of Cardinals, outlined the marching orders for the 133 men who will enter the Sistine Chapel later Wednesday to begin voting to elect a new pope. In his sermon at the final pre-conclave Mass, Re reminded the cardinals that a conclave represented the highest human and church responsibility, and that they must set aside \u201cevery personal consideration.\u201d He said the new pope must foster communion and unity within the church.",

      "description": "Three former Memphis officers have been acquitted of state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop in 2023. A jury took about 8 1/2 hours over two days to find Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith not guilty on all charges after a trial in Mempis state court. The three defendants still face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges last year. Nichols fled a 2023 traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and fatally beat him.",

The order from U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy in Massachusetts comes after attorneys said immigration authorities informed migrants of plans to deport them to Libya, a country with a history of human rights violations. Murphy previously found that any migrants deported to countries other than their homelands must first be allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety.

Officials from the Al-Aqsa Hospital said on Wednesday that the strikes included one attack on a school sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians, which killed 27 people, including nine women and three children. It was the fifth time since the war began that the school has been struck. Strikes on targets in multiple other areas killed at least 21. The Israeli military had no immediate comment Wednesday on the strikes. Israel blames Hamas for the death toll because it operates from civilian infrastructure, including schools.",

India said it was striking infrastructure used by militants. The strikes came amid soaring tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors over last month\u2019s militant attack on tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the militant attack, which Islamabad has denied. The missiles early Wednesday struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country\u2019s eastern Punjab province, according to three Pakistani security officials.",

The Fed is nearly certain to keep its rate unchanged when it concludes its latest policy meeting Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the Fed wants to see how the duties impact consumer prices and the economy. A big issue is how tariffs will impact inflation. Nearly all economists expect the import taxes will lift prices, but it\u2019s not clear by how much or for how long.",

The proposal prompted outrage from Democrats and environmental groups who called the plan a betrayal that could lead to increased drilling, mining and logging in the West. The plan would sell thousands of acres of public lands in the two states, and calls for some of the parcels to be considered for affordable housing projects. It's now part of Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that is moving through Congress.",

Trump says the U.S. doesn\u2019t have to sign any deals, but he also says the U.S. could sign 25 of them right now. He says he's looking for fair deals on all sides, but also that he doesn\u2019t care about other countries\u2019 markets. He says his team can sit down to negotiate the terms of a deal, and that he might just impose a set of tariffs on his own.",
