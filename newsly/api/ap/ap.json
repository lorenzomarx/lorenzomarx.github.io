      "description": "Two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in Washington were fatally shot while leaving an event at a Jewish museum, and the suspect yelled, \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d after he was arrested. That's according to Washington police and federal authorities. The attack occurred Wednesday evening. The violence was seen by officials in Israel and the U.S. as the latest in a growing wave of antisemitism as Israel ramps up its offensive in the Gaza Strip, and as food security experts have warned that Gaza risks falling into famine unless Israel\u2019s blockade ends. The suspect has been identified as Elias Rodriguez, a 30-year-old from Chicago.",

Speaker Mike Johnson defied the skeptics within his ranks and muscled President Donald Trump\u2019s priority bill to approval Thursday. Last-minute concessions and a stern warning from Trump appeared to win over the hold outs to salvage what he calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d The outcome caps an intense time on Capitol Hill, with days of private negotiations and public committee hearings. Democrats, without the votes to stop Trump\u2019s package, tried to stall it. The Congressional Budget Office says the tax provisions would add $3.8 trillion to federal deficits.",

The Trump administration says it expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes in the United States but refused to reveal where they would end up. Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. He ordered a new set of interviews with the migrants, either back in the U.S. or abroad. Before Wednesday's hearing, administration officials accused \u201cactivist judges\u201d of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.",

State media reported the ship slid off the ramp and became stuck after the flatcar failed to move alongside it, throwing off its balance and crushing parts of the ship\u2019s bottom. The accident at Wednesday\u2019s ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin was an embarrassing setback for Kim, who has emphasized naval advancement as key to his nuclear-armed military. The report said Kim blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for the accident. The damaged vessel was likely in the same class as the country\u2019s first destroyer unveiled in April.",

      "description": "Whether its No Mow May or Let It Bloom June or Leave The Leaves, homeowners are finding more ways to adopt a low mow lifestyle instead of keeping up with short, manicured lawns. Supporters say the taller grass and flowers provide a habitat for pollinators and insects during crucial spring months, while also improving water retention in the soil. The No Mow May trend also has its detractors who say its a temporary help if done only once a year and invasive weeds are likely to take over if not pruned back. In Nashville, homeowner Brandon Griffith said he was just tired of mowing when he stopped and waited to see what came up in his yard. Now his wild yard is full of insects, lizards, birds and butterflies, along with flowers and grasses.",
