      "description": "Hope of finding survivors of the catastrophic flooding in Texas is dimming a day after the death toll surpassed 100. But crews have kept up the search for people missing in the aftermath. The search efforts benefited Tuesday from improving weather. The storms that battered the Hill Country for the past four days began to lighten up, although isolated pockets of heavy rain were still possible. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott planned to make another visit Tuesday to Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died during the flash floods. Officials said Monday that 10 campers and one counselor have still not been found.",

      "description": "Texas inspectors approved Camp Mystic\u2019s emergency plan just two days before devastating floods killed over 27 people, mostly children, at the Texas summer camp. Records released Tuesday show the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but details of the plan remain unclear. On July 4, torrential rain caused the Guadalupe River to rise rapidly, overwhelming the camp. Survivors clung to trees as cabins and tents were swept away. Despite warnings and nearby camps evacuating, Camp Mystic did not relocate its 557 campers and 100 staff. Questions remain about the camp\u2019s preparedness and response during the disaster.",

      "description": "The last time President Donald Trump rolled out tariffs this high, financial markets quaked, consumer confidence crashed and his popularity plunged. Only three months later, he\u2019s betting this time is different. In his new round of tariffs being announced this week, Trump is essentially tethering the entire world economy to his instinctual belief that import taxes will deliver factory jobs and stronger growth in the U.S., rather than the inflation and slowdown predicted by many economists. There are three possible outcomes. Trump could prove most economic experts wrong and the tariffs could deliver growth as promised. Or he could retreat again on tariffs before their Aug. 1 start. Or he could damage the economy.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine came after he privately expressed frustration with Pentagon officials for announcing a pause last week in the delivery of some critical weapons to Ukraine. It was a move that Trump felt wasn\u2019t properly coordinated with the White House. That's according to three people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. The Pentagon announced that it would hold back delivering to Ukraine some weapons because of what U.S. officials said were concerns that stockpiles were in short supply. Trump later effectively reversed the move. One of the people described Trump as being caught \u201cflat footed\u201d by the announcement.",

      "description": "The Israeli military says five soldiers were killed in an attack in northern Gaza, while health officials in the Palestinian territory say 18 people were killed in Israeli strikes. The bloodshed came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting the White House for talks with President Donald Trump about a ceasefire plan to pause the Gaza fighting. While there was no announcement of a breakthrough from that meeting, there were signs of progress toward a deal. The killings of the soldiers could add to the pressure on Netanyahu to strike a deal in Israel, where polls have shown widespread support for ending the war.",

Derrick Groves crawled through a hole behind a toilet along with nine other inmates in May. Once captured, Groves faces life in prison following convictions last year for second-degree murder. Experts say more than 90% of escapees are recaptured within a year. However, law enforcement believes family or friends have likely helped Groves in a city that has a history of widespread distrust of law enforcement and the criminal justice system.",

That's according to two senior officials and a cable sent last week to all embassies and consulates.

The recipients of the scam messages, which were sent by text, Signal and voice mail, were not identified in the cable. A copy was shared with The Associated Press.",

The Transportation Security Administration is looking to abandon the requirement, according to media reports.
