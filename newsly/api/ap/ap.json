      "description": "Forced leaves have begun in Washington and worldwide for most employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Under a Trump administration plan, the agency is to be left with fewer than 300 workers out of many thousands. The leaves at USAID started Friday. Federal workers associations have turned to the courts to try to roll back orders dismantling most of the agency and U.S.- funded aid programs around the world. It's not clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what Trump administration says is a review of the aid and development programs it wants to resume.",

      "description": "A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to push out federal employees by offering them financial incentives. The decision Thursday comes hours before the midnight deadline for workers to apply for the program. U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. in Boston sided with several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan orchestrated by Trump adviser Elon Musk. The Republican president is trying to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. The judge didn't express an opinion on the legality of the program. He scheduled a hearing for Monday and directed administration officials to extend the deadline to apply for the program until after the hearing.",

      "description": "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks. A day after his press secretary cited some $8 million in spending for Politico subscriptions, Trump dubbed it a \u201cscandal\u201d and online sleuths started looking for evidence of payments to other organizations like the New York Times and Associated Press. Said one Trump aide online: \u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions.\u201d But it's actually a long-running tradition, depended upon by governments around the world to help them keep up with what is going on. And, the AP noted, has been a staple of Democratic and Republican administrations.",

Thirteen attorneys general, including New York\u2019s Letitia James, said in a statement issued Thursday that they were taking action in defense of the Constitution, people's right to privacy and essential funding that individuals and communities are counting on. Government officials and labor unions have been among those raising concerns about DOGE\u2019s involvement with the payment system for the federal government.

The NATO-nation military officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the fire and radio transmission that Russian authorities haven\u2019t publicly reported. The officials said a NATO-nation ship recorded the radio exchanges involving the Russian eavesdropping vessel Kildin. The audio provides an unusual peek inside Russia\u2019s fleet of spy ships that NATO nations are watching closely. A retired French vice admiral said the blaze highlights logistical difficulties for Russia of maintaining naval forces in the Mediterranean.",

Now the world\u2019s richest man has brought the same slash-and-burn strategy to the federal government. Some people who experienced Musk\u2019s takeover at Twitter have a warning: Expect chaos, cuts driven by ideology as much as by cost concerns, intimidation and plenty of lawsuits. Since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has consolidated control over large swaths of the government, sidelined career officials, gained access to sensitive databases and invited a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
