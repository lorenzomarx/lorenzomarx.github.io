      "description": "The United States has attacked three sites in Iran, inserting itself into Israel\u2019s war aimed at destroying the country\u2019s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe that prompted fears of a wider regional conflict. Addressing the nation from the White House, President Donald Trump asserted that Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites were \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d There was no independent damage assessment. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran confirmed that attacks took place on its Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz sites, but it insisted that its nuclear program will not be stopped.",

      "description": "The United States has inserted itself into Israel\u2019s war against Iran, bombing three of the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear sites overnight. U.S. President Donald Trump asserted Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites were \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated,\u201d and warned there would be additional strikes if Iran retaliates. The U.S. attacks came after a week of open conflict between Israel and Iran, sparked by Israel\u2019s sudden barrage of attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear and military structure. Iran insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. But Israel views Iran\u2019s nuclear program as an existential threat, and has said its military campaign is necessary to prevent Iran from building an atomic weapon.",

      "description": "The U.S. strike on Iran has fueled fears that Israel\u2019s war with Tehran could escalate to a wider regional conflict and other countries began reacting with calls for diplomacy and words of caution. U.S. President Donald Trump had said Thursday that he would decide within \u201ctwo weeks\u201d whether to get involved. In the end, it took just days to decide, and Washington inserted itself into Israel\u2019s campaign with its early Sunday attack. It remained unclear early how much damage had been inflicted, but Iran had pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault.",

In 2023, a NATO-Ukraine Council was set up, and Kyiv\u2019s membership path fast-tracked. The summit in the Netherlands starting Tuesday will be different. NATO\u2019s most powerful member, the United States, is vetoing Ukraine\u2019s membership. Zelenskyy is invited again, but he won't be seated at NATO's table. Ukraine is only likely to get a brief mention in this year's summit statement.",

Greeting supporters at New Jersey's Newark International Airport on Saturday, Khalil pushed his infant son's stroller with one hand and pumped his fist in the air with the other. He told reporters he will continue to speak up for Palestine even if threatened with death. Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, wasn't accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. But the government has said noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled for what it deems antisemitic views.",
