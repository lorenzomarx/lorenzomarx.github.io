      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is calling for a deal on the war in Gaza. In between posts about a Senate vote on his tax cuts and spending bill, Trump pleaded early Sunday on his social media platform Truth Social for a deal and the release of hostages.

      "description": "Russia has launched its biggest aerial attack against Ukraine overnight. The escalating bombing campaign has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the 3-year-old war. Ukraine\u2019s air force says the assault involved 537 aerial weapons including drones and missiles, of which 249 were intercepted and 226 were likely jammed. The strikes targeted several regions, including western Ukraine, far from the front lines. Officials confirmed two deaths, one in Kherson and another in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine\u2019s air force said one of its F-16 warplanes supplied by its Western partners crashed after sustaining damage while shooting down air targets. The pilot died.",

      "description": "Thousands of protesters in Serbia have rallied against President Aleksandar Vucic, demanding early parliamentary elections. The demonstration, led by university students, marked nearly eight months of anti-government protests fueled by allegations of corruption and negligence. Clashes erupted in Belgrade between protesters and riot police, resulting in dozens of arrests and injuries on both sides. Protesters accused Vucic\u2019s government of stifling democracy and cracking down on dissent. Meanwhile, Vucic dismissed the protests, accusing opponents of inciting violence. Despite government pressure, the large turnout highlighted ongoing public discontent with Vucic\u2019s administration, which has ruled Serbia for over a decade.",

Leo celebrated Mass at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Sunday, marking the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, typically used for a special collection for Peter's Pence, a key fundraising initiative. The Vatican\u2019s promotional efforts this year include videos, posters, and online donation options.

Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they've run into a series of setbacks. Senators are expected to take a procedural vote Saturday to begin debate on the bill, but the timing is uncertain and there's a long path ahead after that. Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for more votes before it could reach the White House.",

And the country\u2019s Taliban government is more than happy to welcome them. Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries. Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage largely because of the Taliban's restrictions on women and girls has left much of its population mired in poverty. As the country struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government. Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week.",
