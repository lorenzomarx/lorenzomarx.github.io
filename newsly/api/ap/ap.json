      "description": "Detailed Army plans for a potential military parade on President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday in June call for more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands and potentially a couple thousand civilians. The Associated Press obtained the planning documents, which are dated April 29 and 30. They represent the Army\u2019s most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th birthday festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Trump has long wanted but is still being discussed. The slides don't include any price estimates. But it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars to put on an event of that size.",

      "description": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been thrown into two top national security roles at once after President Donald Trump appointed him to temporarily replace Mike Waltz as national security adviser. Just 100 days into his tenure as America\u2019s top diplomat, the former Florida senator now becomes just the second person to hold both roles, following only the late Henry Kissinger. Rubio is a one-time Trump rival and hawkish conservative who the president derided as \u201cLittle Marco\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign. He's proven adept at aligning himself with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy positions and turning away from previously held priorities.",

      "description": "What\u2019s emerged from the Washington-led effort to end the war in Ukraine suggests a deal that seems likely to be favorable to Russia. President Donald Trump has sharply rebuked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, echoed Kremlin talking points, and indicated Kyiv would have to surrender territory and forego NATO membership. What\u2019s more, he has engaged in a rapprochement with Moscow that was unthinkable months ago. More recently, Trump has offered mixed signals \u2013 social media posts that perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin is stringing him along \u2013 and a deal has yet to materialize. While the optics so far have been in the Kremlin\u2019s favor, no proposals that were put forth have been cemented.",

The strike came after days of clashes between pro-Syrian government gunmen and fighters who belong to the Druze minority sect near the capital, Damascus. The clashes left dozens of people dead or wounded. The Israeli army said in a statement that fighter jets struck adjacent to the area of the Palace of President Hussein al-Sharaa in Damascus. It gave no further details. Pro-government Syrian media outlets said the strike hit close to the People\u2019s Palace on a hill overlooking the city.",

But with Trump now leading negotiations with Iran, Netanyahu's cries have fallen silent. Netanyahu and his nationalist supporters hoped Trump\u2019s ascent to the White House would be advantageous because of Trump\u2019s history of support for Israel. They thought they might find in him long elusive U.S. backing for a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. But Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has shown the relationship is more complicated.",

However, in a ministry statement it said one-sided tariffs of up to 145% imposed by President Donald Trump remain an obstacle and undermine trust. The statement reiterated China\u2019s stance that is open to talks, but also that Beijing is determined to fight if it must. The statement cited an unnamed ministry spokesperson as saying that Beijing had taken note of various statements by senior U.S. officials indicating a willingness to negotiate over tariffs. But it emphasized that China would regard overtures without a change in President Donald Trump\u2019s sharp tariff hikes as insincere.",

It will be closely watched as a gauge of public confidence in Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\u2019s leadership. The People\u2019s Action Party has won every election since the Asian financial hub gained independence in 1965. Wong, who took office last year, hopes to clinch a stronger mandate after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls over voters\u2019 rising discontent with the government. The PAP kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, but it ceded more seats to the opposition, which won 10 seats, the most ever. The opposition has acknowledged it cannot unseat the PAP but is appealing to voters for a stronger voice in Parliament.",
