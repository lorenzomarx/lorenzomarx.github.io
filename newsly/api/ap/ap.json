In the interview, Trump also said he has not seen enough action from Canada and Mexico to stave off the tariffs he has threatened to impose. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he said of the United States' two largest trading partners. \u201cSomething has to happen.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire on Monday came after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week. An American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit contends Trump\u2019s order attempts to upend a fundamental American constitutional value. Trump\u2019s Republican administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not entitled to citizenship and is appealing the Seattle judge\u2019s block on his order.",

Russell Vought is the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought directed the CFPB in a Saturday night email to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama created it following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.",

But even a conservative majority with a robust view of presidential power might balk at some of what the president wants to do. The court gave Trump major victories last year that helped clear away potential obstacles to his reelection, postponing his criminal trial in Washington, D.C., then affording immunity from prosecution for official actions. But Trump\u2019s first term was marked by significant defeats \u2014 as well as some wins \u2014 at the court.",
