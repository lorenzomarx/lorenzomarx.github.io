The authorization followed mostly peaceful protests Monday. The 2,000 Guard members are an addition to the 2,100 Guard troops the president previously mobilized for the protests Sunday morning. Trump also deployed 700 Marines to help them Monday. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the deployments reckless and \u201cdisrespectful to our troops.\" Trump said Monday that the city would have been \u201ccompletely obliterated\u201d if he had not deployed the Guard.",

He's gone as far as ordering the California National Guard over the objections of the state's governor, the first time in 60 years that has happened.

The attack early Tuesday struck the capital, Kyiv, and the southern port city of Odesa. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \u201cone of the biggest\u201d in the more than three-year-old war. Explosions and the buzzing of drones were heard for hours in Kyiv. The fresh Russian attacks followed Russia's biggest overnight drone bombardment of Ukraine in the three-year war. Russia has been launching a record-breaking number of drones and missiles targeting Ukraine while the two countries continue to swap prisoners of war, the only tangible outcome of direct peace talks. A ceasefire, long sought by Kyiv, remains elusive.",

The presummer rite was more subdued than the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in 2023 when Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset and last year when the company hyped AI features that didn't pan out as envisioned. Although Apple announced helpful AI tools and the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade, it's still facing questions about its ability to innovate and navigate a gauntlet of other challenges.",
