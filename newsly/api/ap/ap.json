      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 2026 budget plan would slash non-defense domestic spending by $163 billion, while increasing expenditures on national security. That's according to statements released by the White House on Friday. The budget showed a desire to crack down on diversity programs and initiatives to address climate change. But the administration has yet to release detailed tables on what it wants income taxes, tariffs or the budget deficit to be. This budget is engineered by Trump budget director Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025. It comes as Congress is already deep into drafting the Republican president's big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered money for deportations and border security.",

The vessel belonging to the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was trying to get food and supplies to people in Gaza, said the statement. Malta\u2019s government said 12 crew members and four civilians were on board and no casualties were reported. For two months Israel has blocked any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, throwing Gaza into what is believed to be the worst humanitarian crisis in nearly 19 months of war. Israel\u2019s army didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",

The S&P 500 climbed 0.8% in morning trading Friday, putting the index on track for a ninth straight day of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 316 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.8%. Employers added 177,000 jobs in April, more than forecast. However the latest job figures don't yet reflect the effects on the economy of President Donald Trump\u2019s across-the-board tariffs against America's trading partners. Treasury yields rose in the bond market.",

Trump signed the order Thursday, alleging \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting. Trump's order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies to \u201ccease Federal funding\u201d for Arlington, Virginia-based PBS and Washington, D.C.-based National Public Radio. The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump\u2019s election.",

He's escalating a showdown with the first major college that has defied his efforts to crack down on campus activism. Trump wrote on his social media site Friday: \u201cWe are going to be taking away Harvard\u2019s Tax Exempt Status.\" The president has questioned that status since the school refused to comply with the administration\u2019s demands for broad government and leadership changes, revisions to its admissions policy, and audits of how diversity is viewed on the campus. That prompted the administration to block more than $2 billion in federal grants to the institution.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday said 216 pediatric deaths already have been reported. That eclipses the 207 reported the previous flu season, and is the most since the 2009-2010 H1N1 global flu pandemic. There are likely several contributors to this season\u2019s severity, but one pediatric infectious diseases specialist says a big one is that fewer children are getting flu shots. Flu vaccinations may not prevent people from getting sick, but research shows they do prevent hospitalizations and deaths.",

Tim Friede has injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades and has been bitten by black mamas, water cobras and more. In a new study published Friday in the journal Cell, scientists created one antivenom to treat snakebites from several different species in mice \u2014 using antibodies from Friede\u2019s blood. A more universal antivenom for humans is still many years away. The group hopes to test their concoction in dogs next before eventually moving to human trials.",
