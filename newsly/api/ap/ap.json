      "description": "U.S. Treasury nominee Scott Bessent is facing sharp questions from both Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the future of an IRS tax filing system that Republicans have called to be cut. Bessent sat in front of the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing. He told lawmakers that President-elect Donald Trump has an opportunity to unleash \u201ca new economic golden age.\u201d Bessent pledged to maintain a free IRS tax filing system at least for the 2025 tax season, while studying whether it should continue after that. Republican lawmakers have branded that program a waste of money and want it cut.",

      "description": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for interior secretary told a Senate panel Thursday that the U.S. can leverage development of fossil fuels and other energy sources to promote world peace and lower costs. Former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum voiced concerns about incentives for renewable energy under the Biden administration during the the hearing. Democratic lawmakers challenged the Republican\u2019s claims about national security and raised concerns about fossil fuels that are driving global warming. The Interior Department oversees a half-billion acres of federal land and vast areas offshore. Those areas produce about one-quarter of U.S. oil annually.",

The Republican said during his presidential campaign he'll issue first-day pardons for some of the rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump says he'll launch the largest deportation in U.S. history, declare a national emergency to spur the approval of energy projects and end birthright citizenship.

Forecasters predict another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration the coldest in 40 years.

For as many as 280 million Americans, it will mean a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska. Monday's inauguration will see single-digit wind chills, though it shouldn't be as cold as Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in 1985.",

Zhi-feng Zhao's remains were discovered last week by his son, Shaw Zhao, who flew from Portland, Oregon, to Los Angeles to see his father, and was worried to see the neighborhood was in an evacuation zone. Zhao said he had trouble getting to his father's house and had to walk an hour on foot. There was little left of the house, but he saw a coyote sniffing around and was horrified to see his father's remains. Zhi-feng Zhao was among at least 25 people killed in one of the most destructive natural disasters in Southern California\u2019s history,",

U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced the deal on Wednesday, which is aimed at releasing scores of hostages held in Gaza and winding down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.",
