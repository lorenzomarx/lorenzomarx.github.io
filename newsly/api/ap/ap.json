      "description": "Iran held annual military drills with Russia as a second American aircraft carrier drew closer to the Middle East. Both the United States and Iran are signaling they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program fizzle out. President Donald Trump said Thursday he believes 10 to 15 days is enough time for Iran to reach a deal. But talks on its nuclear program have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups. Indirect talks held in recent weeks made little visible progress, and one or both sides could be buying time for final war preparations.",

He also says five countries have agreed to deploy troops as part of an international stabilization force for the war-battered Palestinian territory. While lauding the pledges, Trump faces the unresolved challenge of disarming Hamas, a sticking point that threatens to delay or even derail the Gaza ceasefire plan that his administration notched as a major foreign policy win. The dollars pledged on Thursday, while significant, represent a small fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of war between Israel and Hamas.",

Liu delivered a near-flawless free skate at the Milan Cortina Games to beat out Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai of Japan on Thursday night. Liu had returned to the sport after stepping away following the Beijing Games. She posted a career-best 226.79 points, while Sakamoto took silver after a mistake. Nakai earned bronze after a slip as well. American teammate Amber Glenn celebrated in the kiss-and-cry area with Liu after Nakai\u2019s score was read.

Megan Keller backhanded in a shot 4:07 into overtime, and the Americans beat Canada 2-1 at the Milan Cortina Games on Thursday night to close another thrilling chapter of one of sports\u2019 most heated rivalries. American captain Hilary Knight forced overtime by tipping in Laila Edwards\u2019 shot from the blue line with 2:04 remaining. The goal was the 15th of her Olympic career and 33rd point to break the U.S. record in both categories. The U.S. previously won gold at the 1998 Nagano Games, the first to feature women\u2019s hockey, and in 2018 in Pyeongchang.",

By the end of the Milan Cortina Olympic Games, there will have been a total of 147 curling matches crammed into 18 days. In Cortina, curling began on Feb. 4, a full two days before the Opening Ceremonies. It ends Feb. 22, the last day of competition at the Games. Athletes coming off the ice say that this Olympics has left them worn out, physically and mentally. That reflects the near-constant competition schedule that has led to curling\u2019s popular reputation as the Olympic sport that\u2019s always on.",

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was detained on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, in an investigation stemming from his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He was born in 1960, the third child of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip. He spent 22 years in the Royal Navy, serving as a helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands War. Named Britain\u2019s special representative for international trade in 2001, he was forced to step down from that role in 2011 amid growing concern about his friendship with Epstein. Last year that friendship cost him his royal title and honors.",
