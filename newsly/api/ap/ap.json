      "description": "Trump administration officials are moving to fire FBI agents involved in politically sensitive investigations involving President Donald Trump. That's according to two people familiar with the plans. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, but officials acting at the direction of the administration were working to identify individual agents who could be terminated, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. Among the politically explosive investigations involving Trump over the last four years were inquiries into his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents, as well as hundreds of criminal cases against rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",

The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to have staff remove pronouns from their government emails, disband employee resource groups, and terminate grants and contracts related to the issue. The directive was sent Wednesday and ordered the changes instituted by 5 p.m. Friday. It also asked agencies to remove the term \u201cgender\u201d from government forms and swap it out with \u201csex.\u201d",

      "description": "A New York doctor has been indicted by a Lousiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country. Dr. Margaret Carpenter and her company, Nightingale Medical were charged on Friday with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",

That was the word from authorities Thursday as they scrutinized the actions of the military pilot after the country\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the jet late Wednesday while it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.",

The two aircraft went into the Potomac River Wednesday night, killing all 67 aboard. D.C.'s fire chief said Friday that 41 bodies have been recovered. The passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip. The cause is under investigation and first responders continue searching the river. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says a key question is how high the helicopter was flying.",
