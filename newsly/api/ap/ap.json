An Associated Press journalist has confirmed the damage in a rare visit to the war-torn area allowed by the country\u2019s military government. The town has changed hands twice since the army seized power in 2021. An ethnic minority guerrilla group captured the town in August last year, but it fell back into the hands of the military government on Oct. 1. The recapture of the town is a major victory for the government, coming after the resistance was widely believed to have won control of most of the country.",

A federal judge has blocked the deployment of Guard members to Chicago for at least two weeks, citing no significant evidence of a \u201cdanger of rebellion\u201d to justify the deployment. Trump insists that crime is rampant in Democrat-led cities including Chicago and Portland, Oregon, where a separate court battle is keeping troops from being deployed.",
