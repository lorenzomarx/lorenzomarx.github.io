      "description": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia has surrendered to immigration authorities in Baltimore and faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him to Uganda. The Maryland construction worker became the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous. A judge in Tennessee determined that Abrego Garcia wasn\u2019t a danger or flight risk. He was released from jail on Friday. The Trump administration has said it will try to deport him before his trial.",

It was among several crime-related orders the Republican president signed Monday. The executive order says that flag burning done in a way that incites violence isn't protected by the Constitution. The order calls on the attorney general to prioritize enforcement \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d of criminal and civil laws against flag burning that cause harm unrelated to the First Amendment.",

The letter coincides with the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, highlighting concerns about management and capacity at FEMA. It warns that current practices echo conditions the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act aimed to prevent. The letter criticizes policies like expenditure approval and reassignment of staff to ICE. It calls for FEMA to be an independent Cabinet-level agency. Thirty-five signatories included their names, while 141 remained anonymous due to fear of suppression.",

The sixth-seeded Keys, who was the runner-up at Flushing Meadows in 2017, made so many mistakes Monday, including 14 double-faults, that Zarazua needed to produce just eight winners to earn the biggest victory of her career. The 82nd-ranked Zarazua had lost in either the first or second round in all eight of her previous Grand Slam appearances. Keys earned her first major championship at Melbourne Park in January, defeating No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final.",
