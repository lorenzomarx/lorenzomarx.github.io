      "description": "Ukrainian activists are calling for more protests against a law they say weakens the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies. Thousands of people gathered in the capital and other cities across Ukraine on Tuesday to urge President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to veto a controversial bill passed by Ukraine\u2019s Parliament. After Zelenskyy approved it, activists called on social media for another demonstration Wednesday in the center of Kyiv. Critics, including EU officials and rights groups, say the law undermines the agencies' independence and threatens Ukraine's democratic reforms. Zelenskyy defends the law, claiming it removes Russian influence and accelerates stalled corruption cases.",

      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a flurry of trade deals that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on imports from Japan and a handful of other Asian countries. A deal with China is pending. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says an Aug. 12 deadline might be postponed again to allow more time for talks. The deals offer as little as a 1% reduction in Trump's originally proposed tariffs for the Philippines and keep higher tariffs on key exports of steel and aluminum. Economists say the tariffs inevitably will dent growth in Asia and the world.",

      "description": "Judges at the UN\u2019s highest court are set to issue a decision Wednesday that could set a legal benchmark for action on the climate crisis. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion, a non-binding but important basis for international obligations. The court has two questions to answer: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from greenhouse gas emissions, and what are the legal consequences for governments when their action or inaction has significantly harmed the climate and environment?",

      "description": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is rebuffing pressure to act on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The speaker is sending members of the House home early for a month-long break from Washington amid calls for a vote on the Epstein matter. Johnson said Tuesday morning that he wants to give the White House \u201cspace\u201d to release the Epstein information on its own. The speaker\u2019s stance seemed unlikely to satisfy many Republicans who are threatening to support a bipartisan bill to pry information from the Justice Department. Even before Johnson spoke, a Republican-controlled committee was advancing a resolution to subpoena Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, for a deposition.",

      "description": "The gloomy, demon-invoking lead singer of the pioneering band Black Sabbath who became the throaty, growling voice of heavy metal, Ozzy Osbourne has died. A family statement said he died Tuesday, just weeks after his farewell show. He was 76. The statement did not include a cause but in 2020, Osbourne revealed he had Parkinson's disease. Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents\u2019 groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",

Dr. Salvador Plasencia is charged with illegally distributing ketamine to the \u201cFriends\u201d star in the weeks leading up to his overdose in October 2023. Prosecutors say Plasencia provided Perry with vials, lozenges, and syringes of the drug. He initially pleaded not guilty but agreed to change his plea in exchange some charges being dropped. Perry had struggled with addiction for years. The medical examiner ruled ketamine as the primary cause of his death. Another defendant faces trial next month.",

That she needed surgery for uterine fibroids. And when asked Tuesday night after beating her 23-year-old opponent, Peyton Stearns, 6-3, 6-4 at the DC Open what message others might take away from that performance and that result, Williams was quick to provide an answer about there being no limits for excellence.",
