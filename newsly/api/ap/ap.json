      "description": "Iran has launched retaliatory missile strikes on Israel into Saturday morning after a series of blistering Israeli attacks on the heart of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its armed forces, killing at least three people and wounding dozens. Israel\u2019s assault involved warplanes as well as drones previously smuggled into the country to assault key facilities and kill top generals and scientists. Israel asserted the barrage was necessary before Iran got any closer to building an atomic weapon, although experts and the U.S. government have assessed that Tehran was actively working on such a weapon before the strikes. It also put further talks between the United States and Iran over reaching an atomic accord into doubt.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is urging Iran to make a nuclear deal now that Israel has launched strikes against the country. Trump says on social media Iran should make a deal \u201cbefore there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.\u201d Trump is holding onto hope the long-simmering dispute over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program can be resolved. But with the Israeli military operation now underway and likely to continue for some time, Trump will be tested anew on his ability to deliver on a campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts. The Republican president is already struggling to find an endgame to the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.",

      "description": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is promising to move forward with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles despite the waves of unrest. Noem spoke Thursday, hours before a judge directed the president to return control to California over National Guard troops he deployed after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals quickly put the brakes on that and temporarily blocked the judge's order, which was to go into effect on Friday. The judge\u2019s order said the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded President Donald Trump\u2019s statutory authority.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s sweeping attack across Iran struck at the heart of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, delivering a blow to the country\u2019s ability to enrich uranium and potentially setting its nuclear ambitions back by months or years. As well as killing key military figures and nuclear scientists, the Israeli strikes destroyed part of a plant that was enriching uranium to levels far beyond the requirements for nuclear-fueled power stations. The attacks also destroyed backup power for the underground section of the plant, potentially damaging more sensitive equipment. Iran\u2019s nuclear program has progressed rapidly since 2018, when the U.S. withdrew from a deal to limit Tehran\u2019s capacity to enrich uranium.",

      "description": "The massive military parade that President Donald Trump has long wanted is set to step off from the Lincoln Memorial with tanks, bands and thousands of troops. And the biggest question marks are whether it will be overshadowed or delayed Saturday by either the weather in Washington or planned protests elsewhere around the country. Falling on Trump\u2019s 79th birthday, the parade was added just a few weeks ago to the Army\u2019s long-planned 250th anniversary celebration. It has triggered criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. Trump so far has shrugged off concerns about the parade cost, the rainy forecast and the potential for protests.",
