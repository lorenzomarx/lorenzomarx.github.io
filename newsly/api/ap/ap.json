      "description": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been charged by the Trump administration with transporting people who were in the country illegally. The federal charges unsealed Friday stem from a traffic stop in 2022. The charges allege that Abrego Garcia conspired to bring undocumented immigrants to the U.S. from Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries. The indictment also states that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 gang member. Abrego Garcia has never been charged with being in MS-13 and has denied membership in the gang. His lawyer previously stated that he saw no wrongdoing in footage released from the 2022 traffic stop. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to pause a court order to reinstate Education Department employees who were fired in mass layoffs as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the agency. The Justice Department\u2019s emergency appeal to the high court Friday said U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston exceeded his authority last month when he issued a preliminary injunction reversing the layoffs of nearly 1,400 people and putting the broader plan on hold. Joun\u2019s order has blocked one of Trump\u2019s biggest campaign promises and effectively stalled the effort to wind down the department. A federal appeals court refused to put the order on hold while the administration appealed.",
