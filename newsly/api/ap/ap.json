      "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Washington for a high-stakes meeting with President Donald Trump. Carney will have lunch with Trump before a bilateral meeting Tuesday. The new Canadian prime minster hopes to ease tensions in the trade war, which has created economic uncertainty on both sides of the border. Carney\u2019s Liberal Party scored a stunning comeback victory last month in a vote widely seen as a rebuke of Trump. The Republican president has shattered a decades-old alliance by saying he wants to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and levying steep tariffs. Carney has stressed Canada is \u201cin a once-in-a-lifetime crisis.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump told reporters he wasn\u2019t quite sure why Carney was visiting.",

      "description": "Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said that Israeli strikes had hit the capital, Sanaa, shortly after Israel\u2019s military issued a warning for people to evacuate the area of Yemen\u2019s international airport. There was no immediate information on any casualties Tuesday. The strikes come a day after Israel launched airstrikes in retaliation for Sunday\u2019s rebel-launched missile strike on Israel\u2019s international airport. That was the first time a missile struck the grounds of Israel\u2019s main airport, Ben Gurion, since the October 2023 start of the war in Gaza. The Houthis have targeted Israel throughout the war in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.",

      "description": "An Israeli plan to seize the Gaza Strip and expand the military operation has alarmed many in the region. Palestinians are exhausted and hopeless, pummeled by 19 months of heavy bombing. Families of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza are terrified that the possibility of a ceasefire is slipping further away. Israeli officials said Monday that Cabinet ministers approved the plan to seize Gaza and remain in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time. Details of the plan were not formally announced. It may be another measure by Israel to try to pressure Hamas into making concessions in ceasefire negotiations.",

      "description": "As Congress looks to slash spending and raise revenue for President Donald Trump\u2019s tax bill, Republicans have turned attention to the huge endowments amassed by the country\u2019s wealthiest colleges. Varying proposals have called for raising the rate to 14% or 21%, treating traditionally tax-free universities like major corporations. Trump previously said he wants to see Harvard stripped of its tax-exempt status as he presses for reforms at colleges he accuses of \u201cindoctrinating\u201d students with \u201cradical left\u201d ideas. Republicans appear to be chipping away at the long-held notion that colleges provide the kind of public benefit that deserves to be protected from heavy taxation.",

Merz had been expected to win smoothly in the vote on Tuesday. A candidate for chancellor has never failed to win on the first ballot in post-World War II Germany. Merz needed a majority of 316 out of 630 votes in a secret ballot but only received 310 votes. The lower house of parliament has 14 days to elect a candidate with an absolute majority.

      "description": "Cardinals electing a new pope have some fundamental questions to weigh, beyond whether to give the Catholic Church its first Asian or African pope. Despite hailing from 70 different countries, the 133 cardinals seem fundamentally united in finding a pope who will be able to make the 2,000-year-old church credible and relevant today, especially to young people. That's a tall task, given the sexual abuse and financials scandals that have sullied the church\u2019s reputation. Add to that the Holy See\u2019s dire financial state and often-dysfunctional bureaucracy, and the job of being pope in the 21st century seems almost impossible. As Cardinal William Seng Chye Goh of Singapore put it: \u201cWe need a superman!\u201d",

      "description": "Baseball players from major leaguers to Little Leaguers are using sliding mitts as a form of self-expression, even it at some levels, they're not needed at all. The padded gloves are designed to protect a player's hand when they slide head-first to reach for a base. The equipment was first introduced by former major leaguer Scott Podsednik in the late 2000s. The market has exploded in the last 16 years, with millions of them being sold each season to players at all levels in a wide array of colors and designs. At the youth levels, it's all about fashion over function. Most leagues ban or limit head-first slides for players 12 and under. That hasn't stopped them from being in heavy demand anyway.",
