      "description": "Republican skepticism in the Senate of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees has been worn down. And that's put his unconventional choices for some of the most powerful positions in the federal government on the verge of confirmation. Floor votes are expected this week on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's in line to be the nation\u2019s health secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, the choice for director of national intelligence. One by one, Republicans have acquiesced to Trump\u2019s picks, even those whose personal history, lack of experience and unorthodox views would have once made them hardly imaginable for a Cabinet.",

      "description": "Nearly three years after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, his troops are making steady progress on the battlefield. Kyiv is grappling with shortages of men and weapons. And a new U.S. president could soon halt Ukraine\u2019s massive supply of military aid. Russian and Western analysts say Putin is closer than ever to achieving his objectives in the battle-weary country, with little incentive to come to the negotiating table, no matter how much U.S. President Donald Trump might cajole or threaten him. Both are signaling their readiness for discussions on Ukraine -\u2013 by phone or in person -\u2013 using a combination of flattery and threats.",

      "description": "Talks on a spending bill for the current budget year have bogged down in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to slash federal spending and its workforce. Republican leaders say Democrats have walked away from negotiations. Not so, say Democrats. The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. The two sides also disagree about following an agreement made in mid-2023 with then-President Joe Biden that would increase spending this budget year by 1% for both defense and nondefense. Democrats want to follow that agreement. Republicans don't.",

That's because of President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration. It's the latest setback for this group of American allies. They've already gained strong backing over the years from veteran groups and members of Congress. Yet they continue to face hurdles in rebuilding their lives after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Many are now left stranded in Albania, Pakistan and Qatar. That's where they're awaiting transfer to the U.S. Others are in hiding from the Taliban in Afghanistan.",

      "description": "This year\u2019s Super Bowl commercials are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that viewers need a diversion from weighty matters. As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit the airwaves on Sunday. A Northwestern University marketing professor says most Super Bowl ads were in development during last fall\u2019s U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority. Many advertisers put their ads online ahead of the game, but some big brands held out to maintain an element of surprise. Marketing experts say the overall lineup features a lot of simple humor and nostalgia but few creative risks.",

      "description": "If you\u2019re throwing a watch party for the Super Bowl, you couldn\u2019t ask for a better backdrop and inspiration than host city New Orleans. It's known for enticing food, and one that's fun to make and enjoy is the po'boy sandwich. Experts say that what makes the po'boy different from other sandwiches is the bread. It's got a crisp, thin crust and an airy, malty interior. You use two big pieces of it. If you're not in New Orleans, you might have to use a baguette or Italian loaf instead of the traditional New Orleans French bread. A fully dressed po'boy means shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced pickles and mayonnaise. But any combination is fine. Popular fillings include roast beef, fried oysters and fried shrimp.",

As visitors flood New Orleans this week and millions tune into the Super Bowl on Sunday, Williams will be celebrating her personal achievements and her culture. The 26-year-old artist is the first person to handcraft both the Super Bowl logo and theme art. Her intricate beadwork reflects the spirit of her city, and celebrates Black Masking culture, which she was introduced to during childhood.",

      "description": "Israeli officials say Israeli forces have withdrawn from a key Gaza corridor, part of Israel\u2019s commitments under a tenuous ceasefire deal with Hamas. The deal is moving ahead but faces a major test over whether the sides can negotiate its planned extension. Israel agreed as part of the truce to remove its forces from the 4-mile Netzarim corridor, a strip of land that bisects northern Gaza from the south. While the development Sunday signals the agreement is moving ahead, the sides appear to have made little progress on negotiating the deal\u2019s second phase, which is meant to extend the truce and lead to the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.",
