      "description": "President Donald Trump is heading to Capitol Hill to seal the deal on his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d Using his power of political persuasion, Trump will try to unify divided House Republicans on the multitrillion-dollar package that is at risk of collapsing ahead of planned votes this week. The president has implored GOP holdouts to \u201cSTOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE.\u201d But negotiations are slogging along. It\u2019s not at all clear the package, with its sweeping tax breaks and cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs, has the support needed. With all Democrats opposed, the Republicans can handle only a few defections from their slim House majority.",

It would cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and take years to make a reality. Golden Dome for the first time will put U.S. weapons in space, which could be fired to destroy an incoming missile during flight. Pentagon planners have been developing options for the system, which a U.S. official described as medium, high and \u201cextra high\u201d choices based on their cost. The official says the administration picked the \u201chigh\u201d version, with an initial cost ranging between $30 billion and $100 billion.",

Taku Eto said at a party seminar Sunday that he never had to buy rice thanks to his supporters\u2019 gifts, triggering an uproar while there's a rice shortage and skyrocketing prices. He apologized Wednesday and said Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted his resignation. Officials have blamed the supply shortage on poor harvests due to hot weather in 2023, and higher production costs. The government made an unprecedented release from its emergency stockpile in recent weeks, but agricultural ministry statistics show the release has hardly helped to ease the shortage or lower prices.",
