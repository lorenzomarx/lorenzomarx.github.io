      "description": "After nearly 500 days in captivity in Gaza, with little access to media, recently freed hostages have many questions. Now home in Israel, they are confronting a flood of information about loved ones and destroyed communities, and are still figuring out their place in a changed world. Their families are grappling with how to fill them in on what they missed without potentially deepening their trauma. One hostage forced to speak at a staged Hamas ceremony before his release told a crowd of masked militants and journalists that he was looking forward to seeing his wife and two teenage daughters. It wasn't until he arrived back in Israel that he learned the crushing reality: all three had been killed during the Oct. 7 attack.",

Those released are Sagui Dekel Chen, Iair Horn and Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov \u2014 all Israeli civilians with dual nationality taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during Hamas\u2019 deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Their release Saturday came roughly four weeks into a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. It is part of a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. In the ceasefire\u2019s first phase, 33 hostages in Gaza are supposed to be released in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",

That includes avoiding going to the homes of advocates who help them to prepare for the worst-case scenario in which they are separated from their children. Trump has terminated programs that had allowed immigrants a legal entrance to the U.S. and has said all immigrants without authorization should leave. A South Florida advocate says she has gone into at least 15 houses in the past few weeks to fill out paperwork to become a legal guardian of immigrant parents\u2019 children.",

Officials have offered few details about their cross-country investigation, but police and court records, interviews and online postings point to a small group of young computer scientists portrayed as highly intelligent and increasingly violent. Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence. The dead include Border Patrol Agent David Maland, two members of the group, the parents of another member and a California landlord who tried to evict some of them.",

The arrest comes days after a Moscow-Washington prisoner swap that the White House called a diplomatic thaw and a step toward ending the fighting in Ukraine. Russian police said the 28-year-old American had attempted to smuggle a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of drugs into the country. The Interfax news agency said he was detained at Moscow\u2019s Vnukovo airport after flying in from Istanbul last Friday. Mash, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, said the U.S. citizen, identified only as K. Byers, faced up to seven years in prison if convicted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department.",
