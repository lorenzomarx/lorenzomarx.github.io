      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s senior aides and allies are lashing out at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Their criticism from Washington came as he attended a European summit Sunday in London to rally international support for his military\u2019s fight against the Russian invasion. Following Trump\u2019s lead, White House officials and Republicans in Congress are demanding that Zelenskyy display more gratitude for U.S. support and an openness to potential war-ending concessions to Russia. Some suggested Zelenskyy should consider resigning. But they offered little clarity as to what Zelenskyy and Ukraine could do after Friday\u2019s Oval Office meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated him.",

      "description": "Britain is hosting a summit of European leaders to shore up support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump that left many uncertain where the once staunch allies stood. The London meeting on Sunday has now taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally and boosting the continent\u2019s defenses. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will welcome leaders of more than a dozen countries and other officials to the gathering, embraced Zelenskyy on his arrival in London, saying he is determined to find an end to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",

      "description": "Key Republicans and Democrats have been stalwart supporters of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But a blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to sign a deal Friday that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Instead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance further splintered American political support for Ukraine. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has backed Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster.\"",

The United Nations and other humanitarian aid providers are sharply criticizing the decision and calling it a violation of international law.

Communities on either side of the line that divides the United States and Canada are closely intertwined. Residents of Skagway, Alaska, shop in the capital of the Yukon because it's easier to get there than Juneau. Auto parts sometimes travel multiple times between Detroit and Ontario. Craft beer makers in Buffalo, New York, use Canadian aluminum cans. The director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University says a trade dispute will produce far-reaching effects, from price increases to longer waits at border crossings.",

It was a sign that his respiratory function was improving as he continues his recovery from double pneumonia and a respiratory crisis. The 88-year-old pope did continue to receive high flow supplemental oxygen after Friday\u2019s coughing episode, which sparked fears of a new infection. Doctors again said his prognosis remained guarded, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger. Francis, who earlier Sunday had a visit from the Vatican No. 2 and No. 3 official, also attended Mass, rested and prayed, the Vatican said in its evening bulletin.",
