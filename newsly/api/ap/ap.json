      "description": "The Trump administration has released records of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate\u2019s family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination. The release involves an estimated 200,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977. King\u2019s family, including his two living children, Martin III and Bernice, were given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure. The release is part of President Donald Trump\u2019s order to publicly disclose government files on King and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.",

      "description": "The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland. Russia now batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024. Analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record. Some experts say that could soon reach 1,000 a day. This comes amid a U.S. ultimatum for Russia to reach a ceasefire by Sept. 2 or face tough sanctions -\u2013 a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible.",

Local media reported on Tuesday that 75 prisoners escaped during the strike, but 48 have been recaptured or returned voluntarily. Authorities are working to detain the remaining escapees. The airstrike was part of Israel's 12-day bombardment of Iran, which killed about 1,100 people. Iranian officials say 71 people, including prison staff, soldiers, inmates, and visitors, died in the prison attack, but local media reported a higher death toll of 80.

Brett Hankison, who fired 10 shots during the raid but didn\u2019t hit anyone, was the only officer on the scene charged in the Black woman's death. He is the first person sentenced to prison in the case that rocked the city of Louisville and spawned weeks of street protests over police brutality five years ago.

Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped slightly after an initial surge, following the ruling coalition's loss of its upper house majority in Sunday's election. Analysts say political uncertainty is growing despite Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's vow to remain in office.

On Monday, U.S. stocks saw modest gains, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching record highs. Verizon and Cleveland-Cliffs posted strong performances, while Sarepta Therapeutics faced setbacks.",

Once a thriving coal hub, the county now struggles with poverty, with over one-third of residents living below the poverty line. Many rely on federal programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and housing assistance, which are being reduced under recent policies. Nonprofits, already operating on slim margins, are laying off staff or dipping into reserves to survive. Cuts to rural water and internet programs further strain the community, leaving basic needs unmet. Advocates warn these reductions could devastate the region, where federal support is a critical lifeline.",
