On the other side is the Trump administration, determined to go farther than any other White House to reshape American higher education. Both sides are digging in for a clash that could test the limits of the government\u2019s power and the independence that has made U.S. universities a destination for scholars around the world. On Monday, Harvard become the first university to openly defy the Trump administration as it demands sweeping changes to limit activism on campus.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump keeps talking about sending U.S. citizens who commit violent crimes to prison in El Salvador. But that's likely illegal. The whole purpose of sending people to the Central American country's prisons is that they're harsher than ones in the United States and federal courts would have no way of ensuring prisoners' rights were respected. That violates several constitutional guarantees. Additionally, only immigrants, not U.S. citizens, can be deported from the United States. Trump has said his administration is trying to find ways to make such incarceration legal anyway.",

      "description": "A federal judge has put a temporary hold on deportations of immigrants in Colorado who face possible removal under President Donald Trump's invocation of an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act. The Republican president declared the law in effect to speed up deportations of people accused of being members of a Venezuelan gang. The last time the law was used was during World War II. The Supreme Court says those accused of being in the gang deserve a hearing in federal court before being deported. That's led judges in New York and Texas to put temporary holds on removals. Monday's Colorado ruling follows those decisions.",

ICE agent Brian Sullivan took 49-year-old Wilson Martell-Lebron into custody last month as he was leaving court. A Boston Municipal Court judge found Sullivan in contempt, arguing that he deprived Martell-Lebron of his rights to due process and fair trial. But on Monday, U.S. District Judge William Young dismissed the case after the Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell agreed with U.S. Attorney Leah Foley that the contempt order should be vacated.",

The analysis also showed 50% of the patients who were boarded for any length of time were 65 and older. Health care experts say some people who aren\u2019t in the middle of a life-threatening emergency might even wait weeks to be admitted to the hospital. ER boarding is a symptom of the U.S. health care system\u2019s struggles. Experts also warn the boarding issue will worsen as the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. with dementia grows in the coming decades.",

Lornoy David, 18, and Seppe Lodewijckx, 19, were arrested on April 5 with 5,000 ants at a guest house. They appeared distraught during their appearance before a magistrate, and said they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal. In a separate criminal case, Kenyan Dennis Ng\u2019ang\u2019a and Vietnamese Duh Hung Nguyen also have been charged with illegal trafficking, following their arrest while in possession of 400 ants.",

The elephants run as the video from the Southern California park starts to shake and then they appear to encircle the young. They stay in the cluster for several minutes after the rocking stops. The park says elephants have the ability to feel sound through their feet, and the behavior is known as an \u201calert circle.\u201d The quake that hit Monday morning and was centered in San Diego County caused no injuries or major damage.",

Starting May 12, store employees will be required to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms. Shirts can be short- or long-sleeved and collared or collarless, the company said in a memo released Monday. Starbucks will give each employee two free T-shirts. Starbucks said the new dress code will make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers. But the labor group unionizing Starbucks workers opposes the move, saying it won't improve store operations and forces employees to buy new clothes.",
