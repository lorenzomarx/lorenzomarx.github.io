      "description": "Pope Francis\u2019 body will be moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to lie in state allowing the Catholic faithful to pay their respects to the Argentine pope. Francis is being remembered for his humble style, concern for the poor and insistent prayers for peace. Heads of state are expected for the funeral Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square. But the three days of public viewing are largely for ordinary Catholics to mourn the 88-year-old pope. Francis died Monday after suffering a stroke. His body will be transferred Wednesday morning to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The public mourning period will end on Friday night.",

An Israeli strike on the Gaza Strip overnight into Wednesday killed 23 people, according to local health authorities. Egypt and Qatar are still developing the proposal, which would include the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the entire strip and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas would also hand over power to a committee of independent technocrats. Israel and the United States have ruled out any proposal that would allow Hamas to retain influence in Gaza and rearm.",

Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian energy use and says it does not seek to make weapons-grade uranium to build atomic bombs. Rubio said in a podcast interview released Wednesday that Iran could import enriched material for a peaceful program. Iran has long refused to give up its ability to enrich uranium. Rubio says the U.S. is \"a long ways from any sort of agreement with Iran\u201d but is aiming for a peaceful resolution.",

The lawsuit filed Wednesday says the policy put in place by President Donald Trump has left the national trade policy subject to Trump's whims rather than the sound exercise of lawful authority. The lawsuit challenges Trump's claim that he could arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. A message sent to the Justice Department for comment was not immediately returned.",

As investigators began probing the attack, many shops and businesses in Kashmir closed to protest the killings following a call from the region\u2019s religious and political parties. Tens of thousands of armed police and soldiers fanned out across the region and erected additional checkpoints. Police called it a \u201cterror attack\u201d and blamed militants fighting against Indian rule. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.",

Companies like BYD, Great Wall, Geely and Chery Automobile are reaching outward as they build the scale they need to survive brutal competition in their home market. These are not state-run giants like SAIC, BAIC and Guangzhou Automotive. The founder of Geely started out making refrigerators. BYD first built up its expertise in battery technology, now its biggest advantage as the world's largest-selling EV maker. Some others are technology companies allied with automakers to offer autonomous driving.",
