      "description": "The Trump administration has placed two top security chiefs at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Elon Musk\u2019s government-inspection teams. That's according to a current and a former U.S. official with knowledge of the incident who spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to share the information. The former official says members of Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 known as DOGE \u2014 eventually did gain access Saturday to the agency\u2019s classified information, which includes intelligence reports. On Saturday, DOGE representatives obtained access to Social Security and other sensitive information at the Treasury Department.",

      "description": "The Department of Government Efficiency, run by President Donald Trump\u2019s billionaire adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has gained access to sensitive Treasury data including Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. That's according to two people familiar with the situation. DOGE, which is assigned to find ways to reduce federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, would have wide leeway to access important taxpayer data, among other things. Senate Finance Committee member Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday. He expressed concern that \u201cofficials associated with Musk may have intended to access these payment systems to illegally withhold payments to any number of programs.\u201d",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. He's also claiming that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States. The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort are causing a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty. And they're threatening to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year\u2019s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. The tariffs are set to launch on Tuesday.",

Canada had been very proactive for months saying it will retaliate, while Mexico kept a more cautious approach on recent weeks, but in the end both did what they had promised: retaliate. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum spoke in a telephone call before Trudeau announced Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs but there is no indication the two countries are coordinating responses.",

Canada and Mexico quickly announced retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would take \u201cnecessary countermeasures.\u201d Trump declared an economic emergency Saturday in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a lower 10% rate. The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023. That is far greater than the $643 billion in commerce that the U.S. did with China in that same year. Following are just a few imported goods that could be hit first.",

His tariffs against Canada and Mexico in order to stop illegal immigration and the illicit fentanyl trade have led to retaliatory taxes by both countries on U.S. imports. He's placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. He's done so without congressional approval and by his own acknowledgement at the chance of \u201csome pain\u201d in the form of higher inflation, job losses and worse growth for Americans.",

Israel and Hamas are engaged in a parallel battle of optics despite a ceasefire that took effect Jan. 19 after more than a year of devastating war. Throughout, each side has released highly choreographed photos and video of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that started the war and the relentless Israeli bombing of Gaza that came after. The propaganda is designed to make each side look virtuous and strong, and each other as monstrous and weak. This week's hostage releases also told the truth: On Thursday, images of chaotic crowds surrounding hostage Arbel Yehoud raised concerns about whether Hamas was really in control. Israel, meanwhile, airs footage of joyful reunions of the hostage families.",
