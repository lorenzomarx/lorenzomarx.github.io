      "description": "The United States has attacked three sites in Iran, inserting itself into Israel\u2019s war aimed at destroying the country\u2019s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe that prompted fears of a wider regional conflict. Addressing the nation from the White House, President Donald Trump asserted that Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites were \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d There was no independent damage assessment. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran confirmed that attacks took place on its Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz sites, but it insisted that its nuclear program will not be stopped.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is signaling a willingness to renew talks with Iran and avoid a prolonged war. That's in the aftermath of a surprise attack on three of Iran's nuclear sites as U.S. officials assess Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and the threat of retaliation against American interests. President Donald Trump's national security team spoke for him on Sunday. The coordinated messaging suggested a confidence that any fallout from the attack would be manageable and that Iran\u2019s lack of military capabilities would ultimately force it back to the bargaining table.",

      "description": "Iran has spent decades building multi-tiered military capabilities at home and across the region that were at least partly aimed at deterring the United States from attacking it. By entering Israel\u2019s war, the U.S. may have removed the last rationale for holding them in reserve. That could mean a wave of attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East or an attempt to close a key bottleneck for global oil supplies. Iran could also make a dash to develop a nuclear weapon with what remains of its disputed program after American strikes on three key sites.",

In the end, it took just days to decide, and Washington inserted itself into Israel\u2019s campaign with its early Sunday attack.

The explosion in Dweil\u2019a in the outskirts of Damascus took place Sunday as people were praying inside the Mar Elias Church. Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says there were 30 people wounded and killed, but the exact numbers are unclear. Some local media reported that children were among the casualties. The attack was the first of its kind in Syria in years, and comes as Damascus under its de facto Islamist rule is trying to win the support of minorities.",
