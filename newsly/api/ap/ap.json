Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote Friday in a late-night session. Republicans had pushed back questions about Hegseth's qualifications amid allegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behavior toward women. GOP senators prioritized the former Fox News host and combat veteran\u2019s vow to create a \u201cwarrior culture\u201d at the Pentagon. President Donald Trump said, \u201cWe have a great secretary of defense and we\u2019re very happy.\" Trump said.

      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has said since his first administration that he wants to end birthright citizenship, a constitutional right for everyone born in the United States. This week he issued an executive order that would eliminate it, upending more than a century of precedent. The Department of Justice used the citizenship status of Native Americans as a legal analogy while defending the order in court. Over the years the right to citizenship has been won by various oppressed or marginalized groups after hard-fought legal battles.",

It would place her at the head of a sprawling agency that will be essential to both national security and President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to squash illegal immigration. Republicans were determined to barrel through on Noem\u2019s confirmation, threatening to keep the Senate working through the weekend to install Trump\u2019s national security Cabinet officials. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth won confirmation Friday night, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were already in place.",

Those are part of a flurry of actions to make good on campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration. Amid officials\u2019 latest show of force, waves of worry reverberated in parts of the country. Officials in Newark, New Jersey, are lashing out over what they called illegal arrests by immigration agents. Many of the ICE actions were not unusual. However, rumors of arrests and news reports or social media posts about the presence of agents are sparking concerns in some communities.",

The order was sent Friday in a cable to U.S. embassies worldwide. The order threatened a quick halt to many of the billions of dollars in U.S.-funded projects globally to support health, education, development, job training, anti-corruption, security assistance and other efforts. The State Department will conduct a review of which of the thousands of programs can continue. Its order spells out the execution of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Monday.",

Foreign Minister Wang Yi conveyed the message in a phone call Friday, their first conversation since Marco Rubio\u2019s confirmation as secretary of state. Wang used a phrase typical of a Chinese teacher or boss warning a student or employee to behave and be responsible for their actions. The phrase seemed aimed at Rubio\u2019s vocal criticism of China and its human rights record when he was a U.S. senator, which prompted the Chinese government to put sanctions on him twice in 2020.",

Trump has frequently blended politics and disasters, and Friday will likely be no different. He has sharply criticized President Joe Biden's administration for its handling of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and he's suggested withholding money from California unless it changes water policies. Trump will follow those stops with a Saturday victory rally in Las Vegas, where he plans to start detailing how he can begin keeping a campaign promise to exclude tips from federal taxes.",

It\u2019s the second exchange since a fragile ceasefire took effect last weekend. It has halted the fighting in Gaza for at least six weeks during which dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed while more aid flows in. In exchange for the four soldiers being released Saturday, Israel should free 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees, including 120 militants serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks.",

It is another test for the truce that is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the militant group. The fragile deal has so far held, quieting airstrikes and rockets and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory. When the ceasefire began Sunday, three hostages held by the militants were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. On Saturday, four hostages are expected to be freed for 200 prisoners.",
