      "description": "President Donald Trump is visiting Texas on Friday to assess catastrophic flooding that has killed at least 120 people. Despite his past calls to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Trump has praised the federal response to the disaster. He plans to tour affected areas by air, meet first responders and speak with victims' families. The administration has shifted focus from reducing federal disaster management to addressing the tragedy's human impact. But even though Trump hasn't been as vocal about his push to shutter FEMA, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in recent days has highlighted efforts to streamline its operations.",

      "description": "Officials say a Russian drone barrage has targeted the center of Kharkiv, injuring nine people and damaging a maternity hospital in Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Kharkiv's mayor says mothers with newborns are being evacuated to a different medical facility. He didn\u2019t say whether anyone at the hospital was among the injured. Russia\u2019s recent escalation of long-range Shahed drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, which often also include ballistic and cruise missiles as well as powerful glide bombs, has brought renewed urgency to efforts to improve Ukraine\u2019s air defenses after more than three years of war.",

      "description": "A divided federal appeals court has thrown out an agreement that would have allowed accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to plead guilty in a deal that would have spared him the risk of execution for al-Qaida\u2019s 2001 attacks. The decision Friday undoes an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution beset by legal and logistical troubles. It suggests no quick end to the long struggle by the U.S. military and successive administrations to bring to justice the man charged with planning one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States. Mohammed is accused of developing and directing the plot to crash hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.",

      "description": "The State Department is firing over 1,300 career diplomats and civil servants in line with a dramatic reorganization plan initiated by the Trump administration earlier this year. A senior State Department official said Friday the department is sending layoff notices to 1,107 civil servants and 246 foreign service officers with domestic assignments in the United States. While lauded by President Donald Trump's administration as overdue and necessary to make the department leaner and more efficient, the cuts have been roundly criticized by current and former diplomats who say they will weaken U.S. influence and its ability to counter existing and emerging threats abroad.",

      "description": "Communities in rural Vermont face damaged homes and washed-out roads after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding. Up to 5 inches of rain fell in just a few hours on Thursday, swelling waterways and isolating nearly 20 homes in Sutton. Swift-water rescue teams evacuated residents from two homes. This marks the third consecutive summer of severe flooding in the state. According to the National Weather Service, Vermont's frequent floods can be linked to climate change and its mountainous terrain. Meanwhile, Massachusetts also experienced flash flooding on Thursday, with over seven inches of rain disrupting businesses and commuters.",

Futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 0.5% before the bell Friday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.6%. Trump said in a letter Thursday that he'll raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening the rift between the longtime North American allies. Meanwhile, bitcoin climbed to a new all-time high Friday, briefly eclipsing $118,000 before settling around $117,600.",
