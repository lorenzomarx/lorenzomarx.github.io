      "description": "President Donald Trump has floated cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% ahead of a weekend meeting as he looks to deescalate the trade war. Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since Trump sparked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their counterparts in Geneva in the most-senior known conversations between the two countries in months. It comes amid growing U.S. market worry over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods.",

      "description": "Before high-level U.S. and Chinese officials hold talks in Switzerland this weekend to discuss high tariffs, Washington and Beijing have been in a rhetorical duel over which side reached out first. Beijing insists that it is the Trump administration that requested the meeting, but President Donald Trump has retorted by asking the Chinese to \u201cstudy their files.\" Experts call it a proxy fight over leverage when both sides want to project strength ahead of what is expected to be tough tariff negotiations.",

And it follows similar efforts to remove hundreds of books from the libraries at the military academies. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the memo.",

The ascetic bachelor and New Hampshire Republican became a darling of liberals during his nearly 20 years on the bench. The court says Souter died Thursday at his home in New Hampshire. He retired from the court in June 2009, giving President Barack Obama his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill. Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, the court\u2019s first Latina justice. Souter was appointed by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990. He was a reliably liberal vote on abortion, church-state relations, freedom of expression and the accessibility of federal courts.",
