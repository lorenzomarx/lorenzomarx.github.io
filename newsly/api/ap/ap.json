      "description": "A federal judge is set to hear arguments Monday on whether to pause an immigration crackdown in Minnesota. This follows the fatal shootings of two people by government officers. The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security two weeks ago. They want to restore conditions before the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge began in December. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison plans to attend the hearing. Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit legally frivolous. The case could have implications for other states facing similar immigration enforcement operations like that underway in Minnesota.",

      "description": "The Northeastern U.S. is getting the last brunt of a massive winter storm that dumped snow, sleet and ice across much of the southern and eastern U.S. over the weekend. The colossal storm halted air and road traffic in many areas and sent temperatures plunging. As the work week began, the heaviest snow was falling from New York northward into New England. That's after heavy ice snapped branches and power lines in the South, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without electricity. In the meantime, arctic air was spreading in behind the storm and some communities in New York saw record-breaking subzero temperatures.",

Officials say the M/V Trisha Kerstin 3, a cargo and passenger ferry, was sailing from the port city of Zamboanga to southern Jolo island in Sulu province with 332 passengers and 27 crew members early Monday when it apparently encountered technical problems and sank. Coast guard officials said the cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but noted that the boat was cleared by the coast guard before departing and did not appear to be overcrowded.",

Zhang Youxia was the highest military member just below President Xi Jinping. The Defense Ministry said Saturday that authorities were investigating Zhang, the senior of the two vice chairs of the powerful Central Military Commission. Authorities also are investigating Gen. Liu Zhenli, who was in charge of the military\u2019s Joint Staff Department. The full impact of the changes for the army and China in general remains unknown. Some experts say this might have repercussion on Beijing\u2019s next move on Taiwan, the self-rule island that Beijing claims as its own territory.",
