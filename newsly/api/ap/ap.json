      "description": "An idea first proposed on social media has bubbled up to the White House and received President Donald Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement: Take some of the savings from billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s drive to cut government spending and return it to taxpayers. If Musk\u2019s target of $2 trillion in spending cuts is achieved by next year, supporters of the idea say that about one-fifth of those funds could be distributed to taxpaying households in checks of about $5,000. But before you start planning for a windfall, budget experts say such huge savings \u2014 nearly one-third of the federal government\u2019s annual spending \u2014 are highly unlikely.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, got rich consulting for a roster of foreign clients whose interests may clash with the law enforcement agency he hopes to lead. Patel entered Trump\u2019s orbit as a congressional staffer of modest means. But the years since have been unquestionably lucrative as Patel parlayed his relationship with the Republican to drum up business. An Associated Press review of financial disclosure filings shows Patel is now worth as much as $15 million. But as Patel awaits Senate confirmation, his private-sector work is drawing renewed scrutiny from ethics experts and Democrats. Patel hasn't responded to requests for comment.",

The Kentucky Republican is ending a decadeslong tenure as a power broker who championed conservative causes but ultimately ceded ground to the fierce populism of President Donald Trump. McConnell chose his 83rd birthday on Thursday to share his decision to retire when his current term ends in January 2027. McConnell is the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell helped forge a conservative Supreme Court and steered the Senate through tax cuts and presidential impeachment trials. McConnell says he still has \u201csome unfinished business to attend to.\"",
