      "description": "The Hamas militant group says it will release an American-Israeli hostage held in Gaza during the day. In a statement, Hamas did not immediately disclose further details about the release expected on Monday. Hamas had announced on Sunday that it would free Edan Alexander as a good will gesture for the Trump administration. Alexander, an Israeli soldier, was taken captive on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli authorities earlier acknowledged Alexander's planned release, without saying when it would happen. It would be the first hostage release since Israel shattered an 8-week ceasefire with Hamas.",

      "description": "A day after China and the U.S. agreed to a 90-day truce in their tariffs stalemate, China is moving to strengthen its alliances as a counterweight to President Donald Trump's trade war. President Xi Jinping warned against bullying and said he was ready to join hands with Latin American countries to block protectionism. He was addressing a regional forum where he was joined by the presidents of Brazil, Chile and Colombia and other Latin American and Caribbean officials. Meanwhile, the head of the WTO appealed to Japan to champion global free trade. The realities of Trump's global trade offensive overshadowed an initial burst of optimism over the China-U.S. deal among investors, as rallies in stocks and oil prices faded.",

      "description": "A series of military strikes last week by India and Pakistan brought the nuclear-armed rivals closer to a broader war. The possibility of a nuclear conflagration seemed real and the fighting only stopped when global powers intervened. Experts say the crisis deepened the neighbors\u2019 rivalry as both crossed a threshold with each striking the other with high-speed missiles and drones. The tit-for-tat strikes also brought Kashmir again into global focus, as the U.S. President Donald Trump offered mediation over the simmering dispute that has long been described as the regional nuclear flashpoint.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s agreement with China to temporarily slash tariffs for 90 days offered the world a bit of welcome relief. But what persists is a sense of uncertainty and the possibility that the damage from the trade war could already be done. Trump declared the de-escalation of the trade war a victory, saying he would soon chat with Chinese President Xi Jinping about how to preserve the financial relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Regardless, the tariffs are now elevated from when Trump took office and the scramble to respond to the White House\u2019s mix of threats and olive branches might leave CEOs, investors and consumers unwilling to take risks.",

      "description": "A federal judge is refusing to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the purpose of identifying and deporting people illegally in the U.S. In a win for the Trump administration, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich denied a preliminary injunction Monday in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups. They argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are entitled to the same privacy protections as U.S. citizens and immigrants who are legally in the country. The decision comes after former acting IRS commissioner Melanie Krause resigned over the deal allowing ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",

But Trump\u2019s plan threatens to turn a global symbol of American power into an airborne collection of ethical, legal, security and counterintelligence concerns. He tried to tamp down some of the opposition by saying he would donate the plane to a future presidential library after his term ends. Democrats are united in outrage over the plan, and even some of the Republican president\u2019s allies have expressed concerns. Trump will likely face persistent questions about the plane in the coming days as he travels to the Middle East.",

The actor is accused of having groped a set dresser and an assistant on a film set in 2021. The case is widely seen as a post-MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures. During the trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations. He acknowledged that he used vulgar and sexualized language and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",

Lawyers for three-time Grammy winner told the jury that while Combs could be violent, he never veered into sex trafficking or racketeering. Cassie has been at the center of Combs\u2019 stunning downfall. She sued him in 2023 alleging years of abuse. A surveillance video made public last year showed Combs beating her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",
