      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s use of troops to help carry out intensified immigration raids faces its biggest challenge yet on Thursday. That\u2019s when a federal judge is set to weigh a request from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to put an emergency stop to the practice. Newsom has warned that the military intervention is part of a broader effort by Trump to overturn norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy. He also said that sending National Guard troops on the raids has further inflamed tensions in Los Angeles, where large and sometimes volatile protests have broken out since the crackdown began nearly a week ago. The Trump administration called the lawsuit a political stunt.",

The jury foreperson declined to deliberate Thursday, and the judge declared a mistrial on a remaining rape charge. The case has been seen as a bellwether of the #MeToo era. On Wednesday Weinstein was convicted of one of the top charges but acquitted of another. Both concerned accusations of forcing oral sex on women in 2006. Those verdicts still stand. The ex-studio boss faces a third New York trial on the rape count and a new sentencing on his sexual assault conviction. Weinstein denies all the charges.",
