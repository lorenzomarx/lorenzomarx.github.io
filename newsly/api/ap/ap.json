Over the past 24 hours, at least 91 Palestinians have been killed and more than 600 wounded while trying to get aid, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

      "description": "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged. In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster tariffs on imports from almost every country in the world. On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington will hear oral arguments in the case, which is likely headed to the Supreme Court. Trump is facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he\u2019s overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",

Giuffre's family also says Epstein's ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell should stay in prison. Giuffre had accused Prince Andrew and others of exploitation and died by suicide.

The program was created in 1966 and had children run and perform situps, pullups or pushups and a sit-and-reach test. It changed in 2012 to focus more on individual health than athletic feats. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says Trump wants to promote healthy active lifestyles for future generations. Trump plans to sign an order later Thursday reestablishing the President\u2019s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.

A particularly wet spring may have created the ideal conditions for young fireflies to grow into adults and set summer nights aglow. There are over 2,000 known firefly species across the globe. While evenings in the Northeast may seem brighter this summer, the bugs are actually waning at a faster rate than ever before. To look out for fireflies, consider turning the lights off at night and avoid spraying front lawns with insecticides.",

The airline says that the airport fire department and paramedics met the flight Wednesday evening and 25 passengers were taken to hospitals for evaluation and treatment. Serious injuries from in-flight turbulence are rare, but scientists say they may be becoming more common as climate change alters the jet stream. A man was killed when a Singapore Airlines flight hit severe turbulence in May 2024, the first person to die from turbulence on a major airline in several decades.",
