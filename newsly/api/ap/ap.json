      "description": "Human rights received far less mention on President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East this week than is usual for presidential visits to autocratic countries. Rights advocates say that's partly because of some improvements in the human rights record of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But they say it also reflects a worsening human rights picture in the United States. Trump in a speech to Saudi royals this week condemned what he called past American \u201clectures\u201d to Gulf leaders on internal affairs. Some Saudis who fled to the U.S. say they're pulling back from public criticism of Saudi officials, citing the detentions and deportations faced by some immigrants and pro-Palestinian protesters under the Trump administration.",

      "description": "A hospital in southern Gaza says 54 people have been killed in overnight airstrikes on the city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press cameraman counted 10 airstrikes on the city overnight into Thursday and saw numerous bodies taken to the morgue in Nasser Hospital. Some bodies arrived in pieces, with some body bags containing the remains of multiple people. The hospital\u2019s morgue confirmed 54 people had been killed. The strikes come as U.S. President Donald Trump visits the Middle East, visiting Gulf states but not Israel. There had been hope that Trump\u2019s regional visit could usher in a ceasefire or renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza. An Israeli blockade of the territory is now in its third month.",

      "description": "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria. One died shortly after the Trump administration sharply cut funding for the United States Agency for International Development. USAID for years had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria. It helped non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people under threat from Boko Haram militants. Now programs to feed hungry children are closing. A former USAID chief nutritionist predicts 163,500 additional deaths per year worldwide as treatment for severe malnutrition is limited. The mother in Nigeria cradles the surviving twin and says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child.\"",

Premchai Karnasuta, the president of Italian-Thai Development Co, the main Thai contractor for the building project, and 16 other people were charged with the felony of professional negligence causing death. They have denied wrongdoing. Ninety-two people were confirmed dead in the rubble of the building that had been under construction.

      "description": "Defense officials say military commanders will be told to identify troops in their units who are transgender or have gender dysphoria, then send them to medical checks in order to force them out of the service. A senior defense official laid out Thursday what could be a complicated and lengthy new process aimed at fulfilling President Donald Trump\u2019s directive to remove all transgender service members from the U.S. military. The new order to commanders relies on routine annual health checks that service members are required to undergo. It scraps, for now, plans to go through troops\u2019 health records to identify those with gender dysphoria. Instead, transgender troops who don\u2019t voluntarily come forward could be outed by commanders or others.",

Before the court Thursday are the Trump administration\u2019s emergency appeals of lower court orders putting nationwide holds on the Republican president\u2019s push to deny citizenship to children born to people who are in the U.S. illegally. Birthright citizenship is among several issues the administration has urgently asked the court to deal with, after lower courts acted to slow Trump\u2019s agenda. The administration, like the Biden administration before it, complains judges are overreaching by issuing nationwide injunctions that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.",

President Donald Trump suspended the asylum system just after his inauguration as part of his wide-ranging crackdown on illegal immigration. Lawyers, activists and immigrants say the process is now unclear, with many people deported after fleeting conversations with immigration officials while others languish in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. Attorneys who work frequently with asylum-seekers at the border say their phones have gone quiet since Trump took office. Legal battles are ongoing, with rights groups challenging the restrictions.",

Republican governors and lawmakers this year already have taken about twice as many actions targeting DEI offices and activities as last year. And last year's actions were about double those of 2023, when the movement began gaining ground. Some of the latest actions go beyond higher education to also target DEI in state and local government agencies. The actions come as Trump also has ordered a halt to DEI initiatives in the federal government, universities and schools. Many of Trump's actions face legal challenges.",
