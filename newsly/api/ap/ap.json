John Ratcliffe was director of national intelligence during Trump's first term and is the first person to have held that position and the top post at the CIA, the nation's premier spy agency. The Senate's confirmation Thursday gives Trump the second member of his new Cabinet. Ratcliffe told senators at a hearing last week that the CIA must do better when it comes to using technology like artificial intelligence to confront adversaries including Russia and China.",

But there is one renewable energy that gets a boost: geothermal. Energy experts say that makes sense \u2014 the heat of the Earth can make electricity 24/7. Many people working in geothermal come from oil and gas and the industries use a lot of the same technology for drilling wells. Trump strongly supports and gets support from the oil and gas industries. And there\u2019s bipartisan support in Congress for geothermal.",

      "description": "One of President Donald Trump's executive orders offers a new federal government definition of the sexes that could have a major impact on transgender people. It calls for the government to define sex as only male or female. It rejects that people can transition between genders, or that they can be nonbinary or intersex. It declares that sexes are defined at conception based on reproductive cells \u2014 large ones in females or small ones in males. That's a problem scientifically, because such cells don't exist at conception. Egg cells don't develop until many weeks later, and sperm cells aren't produced until puberty. Courts could have the final word.",

The deal announced Thursday represents an increase over a previous settlement deal. The earlier one was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court ruled the earlier version improper because it protected members of the wealthy family from civil lawsuits over OxyContin \u2014 even though the family members themselves were not in bankruptcy. Besides this deal, there have been about $50 billion in opioid settlements announced in recent years.",
