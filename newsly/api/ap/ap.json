      "description": "The leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, has called on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign after revelations about the relationship between former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Sarwar says that \u201cthe distraction needs to end and the leadership in Downing Street has to change.\u201d Sarwar is the most senior Labour figure to call for Starmer to quit, piling more pressure on the prime minister over his decision to appoint Mandelson to the high-profile diplomatic post. Starmer\u2019s chief of staff and his communications director have also quit. Starmer\u2019s office said Monday that he is not planning to step down.",

      "description": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a battle to stay in post as he comes under heavy criticism for his decision in 2024 to appoint veteran Labour politician Peter Mandelson as the U.K. ambassador to the U.S. despite his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer\u2019s judgment is in the spotlight like never before after the recent release of millions of Epstein-related documents by the U.S. Justice Department showed how close those ties were. Starmer's leadership has now been called into question as some lawmakers call for him to quit. He could resign or he could face a leadership challenge.",

There\u2019s still no word on whether Nancy Guthrie is alive, and authorities say they have no suspects connected to the case. Her purported abductors sent ransom notes with a Monday deadline demanding money for her return. Savannah Guthrie says the family is prepared to pay. Investigators say they believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home against her will on Jan. 31, and there are growing concerns about her health because she needs daily medication.",

Opening statements are scheduled for Monday. It\u2019s the first stand-alone trial from state prosecutors in a stream of lawsuits against major social media companies over harms to children. New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez sued Meta in 2023. He alleges Meta platforms enabled predators who target children for sexual exploitation. Meta denies the allegations and says prosecutors are taking a \u201csensationalist\u201d approach. The trial is likely to highlight explicit online content and its effects.",

Opening arguments for the first, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, begin this week. Instagram parent company Meta and Google\u2019s YouTube will face claims that their platforms deliberately addict and harm children. TikTok and Snap, which were originally named in the lawsuit, settled for undisclosed sums. This case marks the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms.",

Not in recent U.S. memory has an American policing operation so consistently masked its officers from the public. Whether to allow \u2014 or ban \u2014 the masks has emerged as a central question as Congress debates over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats want to ban masks as one of several proposals to rein in immigration operations. But many Republicans support the masks. The Department of Homeland Security believes the masks are important to safeguard employees from online harassment. Lawmakers face a Friday midnight funding deadline to avoid a partial agency shutdown.",

      "description": "Prolonged detention has become more common in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, at least partly because a new policy generally prohibits immigration judges from releasing detainees while their deportation cases wind through backlogged courts. The number of people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention has topped 70,000 for the first time. The agency said there were 7,252 people in custody at least six months in mid-January, including 79 held for more than two years. That\u2019s more than double the 2,849 who were in ICE custody at least six months in December 2024, the last full month of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",

The tentative agreement announced Monday involves Montefiore and Mount Sinai hospital systems. Nurses remain on strike at NewYork Presbyterian. The walkout began Jan. 12. The hospitals scrambled to hire legions of temporary nurses to fill in during a demanding flu season. Mount Sinai alone hired 1,400 temporary nurses. The three-year deal, which still needs to be approved by union members, affects roughly 10,500 of the some 15,000 nurses on strike at some of the city\u2019s biggest private, nonprofit hospitals.",
