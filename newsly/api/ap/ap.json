      "description": "The House is heading towards a final vote on a bill to require the detainment of unauthorized migrants accused of theft and violent crimes. It marks the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration. The Laken Riley Act is named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man. Its passage would show just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump\u2019s election victory.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump began his second administration with a blitz of policy actions to reorient U.S. government priorities. He has covered issues from trade, immigration and U.S. foreign aid to demographic diversity, civil rights and the hiring of federal workers. Some have an immediate policy impact. Others are more symbolic. Some already are being challenged by federal lawsuits. In total, the Republican president\u2019s sweeping actions reflect many of his campaign promises and determination to concentrate executive branch power in the West Wing, while moving the country sharply rightward.",

That\u2019s according to a person familiar with Chopra\u2019s situation who demanded anonymity to describe his status. Trump first picked Chopra to be a Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission.",

That's according to a memo to the entire workforce obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday. The memo was written by Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general. The memo says the department will return to the principle of charging defendants with the most serious crime it can prove, a staple position of Republican-led departments meant to remove a prosecutor\u2019s discretion to charge a lower-level offense. The three-page memo signals an immediate and sharp turnabout in priorities from President Joe Biden's administration.",

There are more prosaic kinds of retaliation: having difficulty renewing passports, getting audited by the IRS and losing federal pensions. For the many people who have made an enemy of Trump, his return to the presidency this week sparked anxiety. Some are concerned they could go bankrupt trying to clear their names. Less than 24 hours after taking office, Trump fired an opening shot, ordering the revocation of security clearances held by dozens of former intelligence officers who he believes sided with Joe Biden in the 2020 campaign or have turned against him.",
