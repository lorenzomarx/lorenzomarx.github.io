      "description": "President Donald Trump has blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives. His comments caused outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger Russian military. Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator without elections\u201d and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from Russia, and some of what Trump has said does echo Russia\u2019s own narrative of the conflict.",

Trump suggested Tuesday that Ukraine was to blame for the war on its territory, which enters its fourth year next week. Zelenskyy spoke as Trump's envoy, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv for talks. Talks between top American and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday sidelined Ukraine and its European supporters. Trump\u2019s comments marked a major shift in U.S. policy after years of efforts to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and are likely to vex Ukrainian officials.",

      "description": "NATO members are continuing their largest combat exercises of 2025 amid concern within the 32-nation alliance over its most powerful member, the United States. The drills in Romania come as a shaken Europe grapples with a new U.S. course under President Donald Trump. His defense secretary has demanded that allies dramatically ramp up military spending and said U.S. security priorities lie elsewhere. That cast doubts on Washington\u2019s longstanding security guarantees provided to Europe. The NATO exercises also come days before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

The rhetoric from Trump toward Ukraine comes amid an escalating back-and-forth between the two presidents and rising tensions between the United States and much of Europe over Trump\u2019s approach to settling the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II. Trump\u2019s broadside came not long after Zelenskyy\u2019s comment that Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he tries to bring the fighting to a close on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow.",

While it's true improper payments have been made, including some to dead people, the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data. Dudek said that the database defaults entries with missing or incomplete birthdates to a reference point of more than 150 years ago, but that doesn't mean they're getting money.",
