      "description": "The Trump administration is intensifying its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce by ordering agencies to lay off all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection. Hundreds of thousands of workers could be affected. In addition, workers at some agencies have been warned that large workplace cuts are coming. The Office of Personnel Management told agencies on Thursday to lay off all probationary employees. It\u2019s expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs throughout the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week that told agencies to plan for \u201clarge-scale reductions in force.\u201d",

      "description": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met with Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz ahead of his meeting with President Donald Trump. Modi also met Thursday with Trump administration official Elon Musk. Modi has heaped praise on Trump and hopes to avoid additional tariffs the new Republican administration has slapped on other countries. But that didn't stop Trump from signing an order increasing U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports. That move affects American trading partners around the world, including India. Trump also has decried U.S. trade deficits internationally \u2014 and the U.S. has a large one with India.",

It upped the stakes in a disagreement between the news agency and the Trump administration over AP\u2019s style decision to stick with the name \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d for a body of water that the president rechristened the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d An AP reporter was prevented from entering a news conference with Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It effectively shut out thousands of global news outlets from the remarks and information that came out of the event. Julie Pace, the AP\u2019s senior vice president and executive editor, called it a \u201cdeeply troubling escalation\u201d and \u201ca plain violation of the First Amendment\u201d to the U.S. Constitution.",

      "description": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been sworn in as President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary. The Senate on Thursday confirmed him, voting 52 to 48. It puts the prominent vaccine skeptic in control of $1.7 trillion in federal spending, vaccine recommendations, food safety, and health insurance programs for roughly half the country. Republicans fell in line behind Trump despite hesitancy over Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines. The GOP has largely embraced Kennedy\u2019s vision to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d by directing the nation's public health agencies to focus on chronic diseases such as obesity. He's earned a formidable following with his populist and sometimes extreme views on food, chemicals and vaccines.",

      "description": "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected. Wednesday\u2019s consumer price index report showed that Trump could end up facing the same challenges that dragged down his predecessor, President Joe Biden. The annual inflation rate has risen over the three months since the November election to 3%. Gasoline prices in particular have climbed despite Trump\u2019s claims that his return to the presidency would signal increased oil production that would lower energy costs. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that even U.S. presidents are subject to the invisible hand of supply and demand, rather than the masters of it.",

The Republican governor said Thursday that the laws put Florida on the leading edge of conservative-controlled states using local resources for federal immigration enforcement. The new Florida laws would increase penalties for crimes committed by immigrants who enter the country without legal permission. That includes the death penalty for those who commit capital offenses like first-degree murder. Lawmakers in Georgia and Alabama also moved ahead Thursday with their own bills aimed at furthering Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
