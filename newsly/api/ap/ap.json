      "description": "U.S. conservatives have looked to Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n as an inspiration for a right-wing America, and the prime minister has become a close ally of President Donald Trump. During Orb\u00e1n's 15 years in power, he's transformed Hungary from a young democracy into what the European Parliament calls an \u201celectoral autocracy.\u201d The Orb\u00e1n-Trump relationship is drawing renewed interest as Trump pushes to expand his presidential power in his second term. While the countries\u2019 systems of government are different, there are striking parallels between Trump\u2019s actions and agenda, and what Orb\u00e1n has achieved in Hungary.",

      "description": "Two top European leaders have stiffened their spines over unsettling new policies from President Donald Trump. Ukraine\u2019s president urged creation of an \u201carmed forces of Europe\u201d and the leader of Germany denounced meddling in its election after U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with a German far-right leader. Strident speeches from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday testified to the impact of Trump decisions that have resonated at home and in Europe. Those include Trump's hopes to end the Russia-Ukraine war and nurture political allies.",

Hundreds of protesters held placards Saturday that read \u201cThank God for President Trump\u201d and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority. Many were from the white Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the South African government.",

      "description": "A traffic stop in Vermont has cracked open a cultlike group called Zizians linked to six deaths in three states. Officials have offered few details about their cross-country investigation, but police and court records, interviews and online postings point to a small group of young computer scientists portrayed as highly intelligent and increasingly violent. Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence. The dead include Border Patrol Agent David Maland, two members of the group, the parents of another member and a California landlord who tried to evict some of them.",

      "description": "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has moved to dismiss six of its own cases on behalf of workers alleging gender identity discrimination, arguing that the cases now conflict with President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order. The agency's requests raise serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to transgender and gender nonconforming people going forward. Just last year, the EEOC updated its guidance to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",

This comes as the Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection. IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.",

In the early going, he's empowered Elon Musk to help force the firing of thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies. The new president has imposed tariffs, wiped out diversity programs and rolled back transgender rights. His administration has begun an immigration crackdown that's been overshadowed by so many other steps. At the same time, the economy is beginning to soften, judges are having their say and even some Republicans in Congress are starting to grumble.",
