Saudi Arabia weighed in quickly, noting the kingdom's long call for an independent Palestinian state was a \u201cfirm, steadfast and unwavering position.\u201d Similarly, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters that his country has long supported a two-state solution in the Middle East and that nothing has changed. the militant Hamas group, which sparked the war with its attack on Israel, called the proposal a \u201crecipe for creating chaos\" in the region.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has suggested that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and proposed the U.S. take \u201cownership\u201d in redeveloping the area. Trump\u2019s brazen proposal appears certain to roil the next stage of talks meant to extend the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and secure the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza. The president made the provocative comments as he held talks Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. The two leaders also discussed the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israeli-Hamas conflict and shared concerns about Iran's nuclear program.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump offered a jaw-dropping performance during his joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggesting that Palestinian refugees from the Gaza Strip could be permanently resettled elsewhere. He suggested on Tuesday that the U.S. could stage a long-term takeover of the vacated region, even leading redevelopment efforts to make it a seaside paradise in waiting. He also refused to rule out sending U.S. troops in to seal the deal and said he himself \u2014 ever the real estate developer \u2014 might pay a personal visit. The suggestions will be non-starters for Hamas, though. And they could jeopardize the continuation of a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages the group is still holding.",

The U.S. left the Geneva-based Human Rights Council last year. And it stopped funding the agency assisting Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, after Israel accused it of harboring Hamas militants who participated in the attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which UNRWA denies. Trump\u2019s announcement Tuesday came on the day he met with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country has long accused both the rights body and UNRWA of bias against Israel and antisemitism.",

Trump adds that \"there won\u2019t be anything left\u201d if Iran kills him. He made the remarks in an exchange with reporters Tuesday while signing an executive order calling for the U.S. government to impose maximum pressure on Tehran. The Justice Department announced in federal charges in November that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential election had been thwarted. The department alleged Iranian officials had instructed Farhad Shakeri, 51, in September to focus on surveilling and ultimately assassinating Trump. Shakeri is still believed to be at large in Iran.",

An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods is likely drive up prices for ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms, toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones. The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts. The tariffs on Chinese imports took effect after President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days.",

Police believe the perpetrator acted alone but haven't said if he was a student or what his motive may have been. Tuesday's violence occurred at a school on the outskirts of Orebro west of Stockholm. It offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. Gun violence at schools is very rare in Sweden.",
