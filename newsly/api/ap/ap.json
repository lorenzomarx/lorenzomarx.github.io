      "description": "President Donald Trump is preparing for his first big speech to Congress since returning to the White House. The House chamber will be packed with lawmakers on Tuesday night for the event. It's considered a joint address to Congress, not technically a State of the Union address, but there\u2019s no distinguishable difference for anyone watching at home. These events are often carefully calibrated for maximum impact. What will the Republican president say about Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy? Where will Elon Musk sit? How will Democrats react? How far does Trump stray off script?",

Trump on Tuesday will give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. Some Americans fear for the country\u2019s future after the Republican president\u2019s aggressive early moves, while others cheer him on. Democrats are highlighting the impact of Trump\u2019s actions by inviting as guests fired federal workers and people who\u2019d be harmed by cuts to Medicaid and other programs.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump will stand at the front of the U.S. House chamber to address a joint session of Congress, the first of his second term in office. But Tuesday night's address won't be called the State of the Union. The president's first-year speech is called something else: a joint address to Congress. The term has its origins in the first term of President Ronald Reagan. According to the American Presidency Project, the impacts of these first-year speeches should be considered to have the same heft as the State of the Union addresses that follow in subsequent years.",

Slotkin will deliver the response Tuesday night after just two months serving in the U.S. Senate. She won the battleground state's open Senate seat over Republican Mike Rogers in November while Trump carried the state in the presidential race. Slotkin is expected to focus on economic issues in her rebuttal after Trump announced Monday that 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada would begin Tuesday.

That step came days after a disastrous Oval Office row that has deepened a rift between Kyiv and the White House. U.S. President Donald Trump directed the U.S. to pause all assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in peace talks with Russia. Ukraine, which depends heavily on foreign help to hold back the Russian invasion that began on Feb. 24 2022, Kyiv has feared the possibility of aid being stopped to Ukraine ever since Trump took office.",

      "description": "Republicans in Congress are taking aim at four cities over their policies limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump's administration. Mayors from Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York will appear Wednesday before the Committee on Oversight and Government Accountability over their cities' policies restricting authorities' cooperation with federal enforcement. These are often referred to as \u201csanctuary policies\u201d and the localities as \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d Courts have upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws. But Trump administration officials have targeted sanctuary policies, seeing them as a key impediment to deporting people in the large numbers he wants. New York\u2019s mayor says he hopes for a \u201ccivil conversation\u201d with the representatives.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce illegal immigration have not included going after the businesses that hire workers in the U.S. illegally. A nearly 30-year-old government system called E-Verify makes it easy to check if potential employees can legally work in the U.S. But employers are almost never held to account. The debate over workplace enforcement is, in many ways, a reflection of America\u2019s complex views on immigration, its economic dependence on immigrant labor and a quietly bubbling Republican divide. Yet a 2017 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that most states with E-Verify mandates saw reduced numbers of immigrants working illegally.",

Starting just past midnight Tuesday, imports from Canada and Mexico are now taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. In addition, the 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%. China retaliated Tuesday with additional tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports, among other measures. Canada also has announced tariffs on American goods. Trump's moves have raised inflation fears, even as he has promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity.",
