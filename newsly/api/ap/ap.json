      "description": "Israeli fire in Gaza killed at least 17 Palestinians, most of them women and children, hospital officials said Wednesday, while Israel said militant gunfire had injured an Israeli soldier. They were the latest Palestinian deaths since a ceasefire, which has been punctuated by deadly Israeli strikes, came into effect on Oct. 10, 2025. More than 530 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the deal took effect, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.",

      "description": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have finalized an agreement with House Republicans to testify this month in a House investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. They bowed to the threat of a contempt of Congress vote against them. Hillary Clinton will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 26. Bill Clinton will appear on Feb. 27. It will mark the first time that lawmakers have compelled a former president to testify. The arrangement comes after months of negotiating between the two sides as Republicans sought to make the Clintons a focal point in a House committee\u2019s investigation into Epstein.",

The 65-year-old brother of King Charles III, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, left the Royal Lodge in Windsor on Monday and is now living on the king\u2019s Sandringham estate in eastern England. That's according to a person familiar with the matter said. British media reported that Mountbatten-Windsor will live temporarily at Wood Farm Cottage while his permanent home on the estate undergoes repairs.",

The end of the New START Treaty sets the stage for what many fear could be an unconstrained nuclear arms race. Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared his readiness to stick to the treaty\u2019s limits for one more year if Washington follows suit, but U.S. President Donald Trump has been noncommittal about extending it. Arms control advocates have warned that the treaty's termination would fuel a renewed arms race.",

European leaders have urged China to end its support for Russia over the war in Ukraine. Despite this, China continues to trade with Russia, easing some effects of Western sanctions.

They said the treatment occurred at a screening station in Israeli-controlled territory. Asked about the allegations, the Israeli military said it wasn't aware of any inappropriate conduct or mistreatment. Confusion over luggage rules and tight vetting further marred the reopening, which allowed fewer people to cross than expected.",

Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider \u201cimportant issues relevant\u201d to Trump\u2019s request to move the New York case to federal court, where he can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.

Ryan Routh is scheduled to appear Wednesday in federal court in Fort Pierce, Florida. He aimed a rifle through shrubbery as Trump played golf at his West Palm Beach country club in 2024. Routh\u2019s sentencing had initially been scheduled for December. The judge agreed to move the date back after Routh decided to use an attorney instead of representing himself as he did for most of the trial. The attorney says a just punishment would allow Routh to experience freedom again as opposed to dying in prison.",
