      "description": "Health officials in Gaza say Israeli strikes have killed at least 34 Palestinians. The bloodshed comes a day after Israel eased aid restrictions due to a worsening humanitarian crisis. On Sunday, Israel announced a pause in military operations in certain areas for 10 hours daily to improve aid flow. Despite these measures, Israel continues military operations outside the pause timeframe. Aid agencies welcomed the new measures but say they are insufficient. Images of emaciated children have sparked global outrage. Most of Gaza's population now relies on aid and accessing food has become increasingly dangerous.",

The ruling was announced on Monday by a judge in Bogota, the country\u2019s capital, following a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that Uribe attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group founded by ranchers in the 1990s. Uribe faces up to 12 years in prison and the sentencing will be delivered in a separate hearing. He is expected to appeal the ruling in a high court.",
