      "description": "Vice President JD Vance has struck a nerve with allies after offering skeptical comments about a potential international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France. The Republican said in a Fox News Channel interview aired Monday the pact that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals \u201cis a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d The comments have irked some lawmakers and government officials in the U.K. and France, who view them as a slight that discounts both countries' partnership with the U.S. military in conflict zones over the last 25 years.",

      "description": "The U.S. has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began three years ago. The suspension of that aid by the Trump administration doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine\u2019s defenses will quickly collapse. But it's a major blow that threatens to remove some of the most formidable weapons in Ukraine\u2019s battlefield arsenal. And it ratchets up pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace agreement. The U.S. provides about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s military supplies, including the most lethal and important equipment, like longer-range missiles and Patriot air defense systems. Malcolm Chalmers of the RUSI think tank says much will depend on whether the U.S. cuts off technical assistance as well as weapons and ammunition.",

Bayrou said Tuesday that suspending aid was tantamount to abandoning Ukrainians and allowing for a possible victory by Russia. He said that it's \"obviously unbearable.\u201d Bayrou argued that the suspension could impact not only munitions supplies and other military assistance but also Ukrainian morale. Bayrou said that the \u201cUkrainians feel terribly abandoned and terribly alone.\" France's defense minister separately posted video of what he described as \u201cdangerous behavior\u201d by a Russian Su-35 fighter jet that he said buzzed a French drone over the eastern Mediterranean.",

Starting just past midnight Tuesday, imports from Canada and Mexico are now taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. In addition, the 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%. China retaliated Tuesday with additional tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports, among other measures. Canada also has announced tariffs on American goods. Trump's moves have raised inflation fears, even as he has promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity.",

The $53 billion plan\u2019s endorsement by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo amounted to a widespread rejection of Trump\u2019s proposal. The summit conclusions were welcomed by Hamas, rejected by Israel and met with a lukewarm response by the Trump administration. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi expressed his appreciation for the consensus among Arab countries in supporting the plan, which he said allows the Palestinian People to remain on their land.",
