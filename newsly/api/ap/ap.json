      "description": "Senators are launching a budget \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d in a crucial, if dreaded, step toward President Donald Trump's agenda. They are staying late Thursday to debate a $340 billion package Trump\u2019s team says it needs for mass deportations and security measures that top the Republican agenda. It's a sight to see: Senators will be voting in rapid-fashion for hours on one amendment after another diving into intricate policy details, largely from Democrats trying to halt the package. Even if the Senate package is approved, it still needs to be merged with one from the House, which is preparing Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that includes some $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and up to $2 trillion less spending.",

      "description": "The termination letters that ended the careers of thousands of U.S. Forest Service employees mean fewer people and less resources will be available to help prevent and fight wildfires. This raises the specter of even more destructive blazes across the American West this year. Workers who maintained trails, removed combustible debris from forests and secured funding for wildfire mitigation projects say the loss of such positions could impact public safety. Concerns are particularly high in a region where drier and hotter conditions linked to climate change have increased the intensity of wildfires.",

      "description": "An idea first proposed on social media has bubbled up to the White House and received President Donald Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement: Take some of the savings from billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s drive to cut government spending and return it to taxpayers. If Musk\u2019s target of $2 trillion in spending cuts is achieved by next year, supporters of the idea say that about one-fifth of those funds could be distributed to taxpaying households in checks of about $5,000. But before you start planning for a windfall, budget experts say such huge savings \u2014 nearly one-third of the federal government\u2019s annual spending \u2014 are highly unlikely.",

Standing up for children with disabilities has been a primary role of the department, which enforces the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Historically, most complaints to the department have involved disability discrimination. The freeze on pending cases and Trump\u2019s calls to dismantle the department altogether left many parents worrying about the federal government\u2019s commitment to disabled students. After The Associated Press asked the Education Department for comment on this reporting, a spokesperson said the department ended the pause on reviews of disability complaints Thursday.",

Hamas said it would \u201cconduct a thorough review\u201d of the information regarding the body, and suggested a possible mix-up of remains might have occurred due to Israeli bombing of the area where the Israeli hostages were being held, where other Palestinians were also present. The incident raised questions about the future of the fragile ceasefire. But in the short term, there were indications the deal\u2019s next step, Saturday's release of six living hostages, would proceed as planned.",
