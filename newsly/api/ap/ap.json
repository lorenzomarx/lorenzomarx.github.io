      "description": "Under intense pressure from President Donald Trump\u2019s own supporters, his administration now says it will push a court to unseal secret documents related to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s case. It's an effort to put to rest for good a political crisis largely of the administration's own making. But even if those records eventually become public, it\u2019s far from certain they will appease critics enraged over the administration\u2019s unfulfilled promises of full transparency about the evidence against the wealthy financier. Meanwhile, the administration remains dogged by questions about its refusal to release other records in its possession.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has looked to the marble finishes and hefty price tag of the Federal Reserve headquarters to claim grounds to fire Chair Jerome Powell, with whom he has tussled for years over interest rates. But the extensive use of marble in the building is, at least in part, the result of policies backed by Trump himself. As the Fed moved forward with plans to renovate its Great Depression-era headquarters in Washington during Trump\u2019s first term, it faced concerns in 2020 during a vetting process involving Trump appointees, who called for more \u201cwhite Georgia marble\u201d for the facade of building.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday will sign into law a new set of regulations for a type of cryptocurrency that are seen as a way to legitimize the burgeoning industry. The GENIUS Act sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is tied to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility. It passed both the House and Senate with wide bipartisan margins. The measure is meant to bolster consumer confidence in the rapidly growing crypto sector. Its passage comes as Trump makes it a mission to establish the U.S. as the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",

      "description": "Top church leaders have visited Gaza after its only Catholic church was struck by an Israeli shell the day before. The attack Thursday killed three people and wounded ten, including a priest who had developed a close friendship with the late Pope Francis. The strike drew condemnation from the pope and U.S. President Donald Trump, and prompted a statement of regret from Israel, which said it was a mistake. Since ending a ceasefire in March, Israel has regularly launched far deadlier strikes across Gaza against what it says are Hamas militants, frequently killing women and children. Strikes killed 18 people overnight, health officials said Friday.",

      "description": "Members of Syria's Druze community are searching for loved ones and counting their dead after days of clashes in a southern province that left bloodied bodies of civilians on the streets and homes looted. The fighting in Sweida province this week began with tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze armed factions. Government forces that intervened to restore order clashed with the Druze militias, but also in some cases attacked civilians. One monitoring group said dozens of civilians were rounded up by fighters and shot and killed. The violence has left Druze more skeptical of Syria\u2019s new leadership and doubtful of peaceful coexistence.",
