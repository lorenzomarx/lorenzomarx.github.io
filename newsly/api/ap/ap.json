      "description": "Israel\u2019s military says it struck an Iranian nuclear research facility and killed three senior Iranian commanders in targeted attacks as the war between the two nations continued into a second week. Early Saturday, smoke could be seen rising from an area near a mountain in Isfahan, where a local official said Israel had attacked the nuclear research facility in two waves. Iran continued to launch drones and missiles at Israel but there were no immediate reports of significant damage. Israel says its military has been targeting Iran's missile launchers, and estimates it has now taken out more than 50% of them.",

      "description": "The second week of the Israel-Iran war has started with a renewed round of strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility near Isfahan. Talks in Geneva on Friday between European foreign ministers and Iran\u2019s top diplomat failed to produce a breakthrough. U.S. President Donald Trump continues to weigh his country\u2019s military involvement as concerns spiked over potential strikes on Iranian nuclear reactors. Still, European officials expressed hope for future negotiations. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he was open to further dialogue but stressed Tehran wasn\u2019t interested in negotiating while Israel continued attacking.",

      "description": "A Palestinian activist who participated in protests against Israel has been freed from federal immigration detention after 104 days. Mahmoud Khalil, who became a symbol of President Donald Trump\u2019s clampdown on campus protests, left a federal facility in Louisiana on Friday. The former Columbia University graduate student is expected to head to New York to reunite with his U.S. citizen wife and infant son. The federal judge who ordered Khalil's release said it would be \u201chighly, highly unusual\u201d for the government to continue detaining a legal U.S. resident who was unlikely to flee and hadn\u2019t been accused of any violence. The U.S. government said it would appeal the decision.",

The orange ball crested the northeast horizon Saturday and shone its light into the center of one of the world\u2019s most famous prehistoric monuments. The crowd gathered at the World Heritage Site before dawn, beating the sweltering conditions of the U.K.\u2019s first amber heat-health alert issued since September 2023.

The white top and blue hull of the 56-meter Bayesian, covered with algae and mud, was visible clear of the sea in a holding area of a yellow floating crane barge. The Bayesian sank Aug. 19 during a violent storm as Lynch was treating friends to a cruise to celebrate his acquittal two months earlier in the U.S. on fraud charges.",
