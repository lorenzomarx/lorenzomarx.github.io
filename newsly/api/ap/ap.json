      "description": "President Donald Trump is going further than ever before to enforce his decisions. While orders were sometimes softened or even ignored during his first term, this time he's unwilling to let things slide. The White House summarizes Trump\u2019s approach with the mantra \u201cpromises made, promises kept.\u201d Administration officials also say Trump is entitled to impose his vision on the government that he was elected to lead. Others see something darker and more menacing for the country, and they accuse Trump of hollowing out institutions that have defied him in the past.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving improper Social Security payments. Over the past few days, President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits. Musk called it a \u201cHUGE problem,\u201d as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste, fraud and abuse. It is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Labor has been hailed by union heads as pro-labor. But advocates for workers\u2019 rights are questioning whether former U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer will be able to uphold that reputation in an administration that wants to drastically curtail government spending and the size of the federal workforce. The Republican from Oregon is scheduled to appear before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions for her confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Lori Chavez-DeRemer's voting record as a one-term congresswoman earned her union support. That's led some political observers to assume Trump picked her as a way to appeal to voters who are pro-union.",

The Acacia Center for Justice says it serves 26,000 migrant children under its federal contract. The Interior Department gave no explanation for the stop-work order on Tuesday, telling the group only that it was done for \u201ccauses outside of your control\u201d and should not be interpreted as a judgment of poor performance.

The White House has also broadened its dispute against the AP for other recommendations it has made for word usage, such as the capitalization of Black and not white in racial references.",

They have traveled by car and on foot, through muddy olive groves and snipers\u2019 sight lines, in the occupied territory's largest displacement since the 1967 Mideast war. After announcing a widespread crackdown against West Bank militants on Jan. 21, Israeli forces descended on the city of Jenin, as they have dozens of times since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Soldiers then pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby towns, scattering families and stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over Israel\u2019s creation. During that war, 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what Palestinians call the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d",

The violence has ensured that migration remains a key issue as the country heads toward an early election Sunday. The suspect is a Saudi doctor who drove into the holiday market teeming with shoppers and left five women and a 9-year-old boy killed and 200 people injured. Just one day after Dec. 20 violence, there was a large right-wing demonstration in Magdeburg. Migrant community groups report that verbal and physical attacks on people with a migrant background have increased significantly in the city since then.",
