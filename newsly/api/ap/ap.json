Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy dismissed it as \u201canother attempt by Putin to play with human lives.\u201d He wrote on X that air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine and \u201cShahed drones in our skies reveal Putin\u2019s true attitude toward Easter and toward human life.\u201d",

The talks Saturday in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Whether the two men find common ground in the high-stakes negotiations could mean success or failure in the talks. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon.",

With growing unease over what it means for the rights of transgender people, protesters came together Saturday for what was billed as an \u201cemergency demonstration\u201d in Parliament Square. Trans groups are worried that Wednesday\u2019s landmark decision would undermine their rights, even though the U.K.\u2019s highest court said transgender people remain protected from discrimination.

The full scope of campus DEI rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices. But students at some schools say early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that has helped open the door to higher education. The retreat from DEI has accelerated under President Donald Trump and his threats to cut federal funding.",

At least two dozen Republican groups around the country have invited Jan. 6 rioters to speak to their members in recent months, according to an Associated Press tally. There seems to be a segment of the party's base that views those pardoned rioters not as criminals, but as patriots. One historian see a danger in that because it's \u201ca growing acceptance on the right of political violence, as long as it\u2019s done in the service of Trump\" and his false claims about the 2020 election being stolen.",
