      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken executive action to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico. The move fulfills campaign promises but also sparked retaliatory moves that could signal an extended trade war with key trading partners and, in the case of Mexico and Canada, the closest U.S. neighbors and allies. Unlike during the 2024 campaign, when Trump billed his economic agenda as a sure-fire way to reduce the cost of living for American workers, the president now is acknowledging what many economists have long forecasted: the levies could yield higher prices and lower supplies across the market.",

Canada had been very proactive for months saying it will retaliate, while Mexico kept a more cautious approach on recent weeks, but in the end both did what they had promised: retaliate. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum spoke in a telephone call before Trudeau announced Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs but there is no indication the two countries are coordinating responses.",

His tariffs against Canada and Mexico in order to stop illegal immigration and the illicit fentanyl trade have led to retaliatory taxes by both countries on U.S. imports.

He's done so without congressional approval and by his own acknowledgement at the chance of \u201csome pain\u201d in the form of higher inflation, job losses and worse growth for Americans.",

Canada and Mexico quickly announced retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would take \u201cnecessary countermeasures.\u201d Trump declared an economic emergency Saturday in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a lower 10% rate. The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023.

A confidential budget document showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash and that emergency operations in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan would be the most affected.",

Many of the 37,000 people at the camp are women and children, and the camp director says some argue that they should be allowed to leave if they're not being fed.
