      "description": "A federal research office that tracks the progress of America\u2019s students is being hit with almost $900 million in cuts after Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency found no need for much of its work. It\u2019s unclear to what degree the Education Department\u2019s Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk\u2019s team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute\u2019s work. The Education Department did not immediately share details on the cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will not affect IES\u2019 primary work.",

      "description": "The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from attending an event in the Oval Office after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America. It was a highly unusual move that could have constitutional free-speech implications. AP executives said the reporter tried to enter the White House event as usual Tuesday afternoon and was turned away. Julie Pace, senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press, called the administration\u2019s move troubling and unacceptable. The Trump administration made no immediate announcements about the move.",

A shelter for people who manage to leave these compounds run by the Catholic charity Caritas recently let some victims go and may stop accepting further victims due to the funding squeeze, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said. The shelter is the only one not operated by the government which takes in victims of scam compounds. The sources declined to be named because they were concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration.",

Elon Musk\u2019s company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy in China and leveraged the patronage of political leaders to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability. That\u2019s led some car owners to take drastic action. As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the U.S., Tesla\u2019s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts are by design intertwined.",

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in D.C. on behalf of an organization representing 173 American small businesses, large U.S.-based suppliers, a Jewish group working for displaced people and others. It says President Donald Trump's foreign aid funding freeze has left hundreds of millions of dollars of owed bills unpaid and goods stuck in the supply chain. The USAID deputy administrator has defended the funding cutoff in an affidavit in another lawsuit.",
