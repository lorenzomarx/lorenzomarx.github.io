      "description": "Opposition figures in Uganda have criticized a deal with the U.S. to accept deported migrants. They question the lack of parliamentary approval and suggest it eases political pressure on President Yoweri Museveni. Ugandan officials have shared few details, but have said they prefer deportees of African origin without criminal records. Still, U.S. officials say they are processing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national charged with human smuggling, for deportation to Uganda. Critics argue the agreement benefits Museveni politically and economically. The deal comes amid U.S. sanctions on Ugandan officials over corruption and rights abuses. The lack of transparency and parliamentary oversight has raised concerns.",

      "description": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia has surrendered to immigration authorities in Baltimore and faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him to Uganda. The Maryland construction worker became the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous. A judge in Tennessee determined that Abrego Garcia wasn\u2019t a danger or flight risk. He was released from jail on Friday. The Trump administration has said it will try to deport him before his trial.",

Trump said in a letter posted Monday on his Truth Social platform that he is firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Cook had said she wouldn\u2019t leave her post despite Trump previously calling for her to resign.",

The announcement came after trading closed Monday on Wall Street, where benchmarks reversed some of their big gains from last week. Trump announced his plan to dismiss Cook on his Truth Social platform. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.8% after setting a record on Friday. The Nasdaq composite shed 0.2%. Apart from rattling financial markets, Trump's latest move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court. Oil prices lost more than $1 a barrel.",
