      "description": "A U.N. official says 47 Palestinians were wounded, mostly by gunfire, when crowd overran Gaza aid hub. Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. Human Rights Office for the Palestinian territories, said it appeared that Israeli army fire had caused most of the injuries. On Tuesday, crowds of Palestinians overwhelmed a new aid distribution hub set up by an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation. The crowd broke through fences and an Associated Press journalist heard Israeli tank and gun fire, and saw a military helicopter firing flares. The distribution hub outside Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah was opened the day before by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been slated by Israel to take over aid operations.",

      "description": "Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will visit Berlin to meet with new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. The talks on Wednesday come amid an escalation in Russia\u2019s bombing campaign despite U.S.-led attempts at peace talks. Germany has been the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Zelenskyy\u2019s visit on Wednesday comes two days after Merz said his country and other major allies are no longer imposing any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine as it fights the Russian invasion. Russian forces launched an attack overnight on Ukraine using five Iskander ballistic missiles, one guided air-launched missile and 88 drones.",

It made it through the entire test flight Tuesday evening, but fell short of its main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control. SpaceX had hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff from Texas, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an entry in the Indian Ocean. The first-stage booster ended up in the Gulf of Mexico in pieces. There were no plans to catch the booster this time.",

A closely watched auction of 40-year Japanese government bonds drew weak demand as worries mount over growing levels of debt. U.S. futures were little changed and oil prices rose. Gains for shares in technology companies helped to boost benchmarks in Tokyo and South Korea. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 jumped 2%, also helped by a better-than-expected report on U.S. consumer confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.8% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.5%.",
