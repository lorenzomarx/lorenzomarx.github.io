      "description": "Fires that have been burning homes and businesses in Los Angeles for a week have killed at least 25 people, displaced thousands of others and destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Nearly 30 people are missing. The blazes started early last week and have been powered by gusts from the Santa Ana winds, which strengthened Tuesday. Investigators have not determined what sparked the fires. Estimates suggest they could be the nation's costliest ever. The National Weather Service issued a rare warning about a \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d related to severe fire conditions.",

The Golden Globes had transpired less than 48 hours earlier and a series of splashy awards banquets followed in the days after. But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",

Israel accused Hamas of trying to make changes to already agreed upon arrangements along Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt and said it strongly rejected the move. Hamas called the claims \u201cnonsense.\u201d The finger-pointing forced Qatar, which has been mediating weeks of painstaking negotiations, to delay an expected announcement of a deal. The sides have been working on a phased agreement that would include the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas, the return of displaced Palestinians in Gaza to what remains of their homes and an influx of desperately needed humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.",

They have languished there for over two months during a standoff with authorities who demanded they surrender to police because they were mining illegally. Hundreds are still believed to be trapped Wednesday. The disaster has focused criticism on the South African government\u2019s decision to try to \u201csmoke them out\u201d by cutting off food and other supplies for a time. Civic groups claim authorities also removed the ropes and pulley systems that the miners used to enter and exit at least one shaft and send down supplies.

Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, confining the Western-backed Palestinian Authority's limited self-rule to parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The U.S. has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern both the West Bank and Gaza ahead of eventual statehood, which the Israeli government opposes.",

But even if a deal is reached, the torment experienced by families of the hostages and war-weary Palestinians could be far from over. Families of the hostages do not know whether their loved ones are alive or dead, and many will have to wait for a subsequent phase of the agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In war-ravaged Gaza, many displaced Palestinians do not know if their homes or neighborhoods are still standing, and dozens are missing after encounters with Israeli forces.
