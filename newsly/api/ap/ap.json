The suspect shouted \u201cFree Palestine\u201d as he was being arrested. Israel identified the victims as Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky without giving their ages. They were leaving a young diplomats event at the Capital Jewish Museum that was meant to \u201cfoster unity and celebrate Jewish heritage\u201d when they were killed on Wednesday. Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.S said that Lischinsky had bought an engagement ring and was just days away from proposing to Milgrim on a planned trip to Jerusalem.",

It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese communist party, saying it hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024.",

Experts also warn the territory could plunge into famine if Israel doesn\u2019t stop its military campaign and fully lift its blockade. The blockade was in place for more than two months, preventing all food, medicine and other goods from entering the territory that is home to some 2 million Palestinians. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out waves of airstrikes and ground operations. Palestinians in Gaza rely almost entirely on outside aid to survive because Israel\u2019s offensive has destroyed almost all the territory\u2019s food production capabilities.",

Speaker Mike Johnson defied the skeptics within his ranks and muscled President Donald Trump\u2019s priority bill to approval Thursday.

Democrats, without the votes to stop Trump\u2019s package, tried to stall it. The Congressional Budget Office says the tax provisions would add $3.8 trillion to federal deficits.",

But they don\u2019t think it will be as chaotic as 2024. Last year was the third-costliest season on record, with killer storms Beryl, Helene and Milton. Thursday's hurricane season outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects a 60% chance for an above-normal season, a 30% chance it will be near normal and only a 10% probability it will be quieter than average. The forecast calls for 13 to 19 named storms with six to 10 becoming hurricanes. It projects three to five of those will reach major status, which means winds of more than 110 mph.",
