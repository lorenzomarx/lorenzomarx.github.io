      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s use of troops to help carry out intensified immigration raids faces its biggest challenge yet on Thursday. That\u2019s when a federal judge is set to weigh a request from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to put an emergency stop to the practice. Newsom has warned that the military intervention is part of a broader effort by Trump to overturn norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy. He also said that sending National Guard troops on the raids has further inflamed tensions in Los Angeles, where large and sometimes volatile protests have broken out since the crackdown began nearly a week ago. The Trump administration called the lawsuit a political stunt.",

The decision to end deliberations Thursday came a day after the jury delivered a partial verdict. The foreperson complained Wednesday that he felt bullied by another juror and said Thursday he wouldn\u2019t go back into the jury room. The panel convicted the ex-studio boss of one of the top charges but acquitted him of another. Both of those charges concerned accusations of forcing oral sex on women in 2006. Those verdicts still stand. The jury got stuck on a third charge. It was a rape accusation dating to 2013.",
