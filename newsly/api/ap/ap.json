      "description": "Democrats are planning to fight President Donald Trump's efforts to pause federal grants and loans. The court battle will likely begin with a lawsuit from the New York attorney general. The funding freeze is scheduled to take effect Tuesday as Trump\u2019s administration begins an across-the-board ideological review. Administration officials said the pause is necessary to ensure that spending complies with the president's executive orders. The Republican administration's decision could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research, education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted. It\u2019s unclear how sweeping the pause will be.",

A memo Tuesday from the Office of Personnel Management, the government\u2019s human resources agency, says it will begin subjecting all federal employees to \u201cenhanced standards of suitability and conduct\u201d and ominously warns of future downsizing. The email sent to employees says those who leave their posts voluntarily will receive about eight months of salary, but they have to chose to do so by Feb 6.",

      "description": "A sweeping White House order to freeze federal grants and allocations reflects a theory of presidential power that Donald Trump clearly endorsed during his 2024 campaign. The approach was further outlined in the Project 2025 governing treatise that candidate Trump furiously denied was a blueprint for his second administration. At face value, the Monday memo from Trump's budget office is meant to bring federal spending in line with Trump\u2019s deluge of executive actions, notably on LGBTQ civil rights, energy and environmental policy. The memo could affect operations that go well beyond the policy areas singled out. Nonetheless, the potentially far-reaching action is not surprising given the details that were available throughout the campaign.",

The Abu Jarad family returned to Beit Lahiya Monday to find that the orange, olive and palm trees that once stood in front of their house were bulldozed away. The roses and jasmine flowers were also gone. The house itself was a hollowed-out shell. But it stood. At the sight of it, Ne\u2019man Abu Jarad; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters dropped the bags they had been lugging since dawn, fell to their knees and prayed. After 477 days of hell \u2014 fleeing the length of the Gaza Strip, hiding from bombardment, scrounging for food and water \u2013 they were finally home.",

A day earlier, Trump directed the Pentagon to conduct a review that is likely to lead to them being barred from military service. And last week, he sought to define sex as only male or female. His efforts are already facing legal challenges and are likely to see more of them.",
