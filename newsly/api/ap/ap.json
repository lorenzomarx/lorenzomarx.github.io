      "description": "The leaders of four European countries have arrived in Kyiv as calls intensify for Russia to agree to a monthlong cease-fire in the war. The leaders of France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom arrived together Saturday at the train station in Kyiv, where they are expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The visit marked the first time the leaders of the four countries have travelled together to Ukraine. Friedrich Merz is making a first visit to Ukraine as Germany\u2019s new Chancellor. Along with President Donald Trump, the European leaders are pushing for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire to allow for peace talks on ending the conflict.",

      "description": "Two months ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine was ready to accept a U.S. proposal for a 30-day cease-fire, provided Russia did the same. The Russian leader balked, saying a temporary break in hostilities would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies. Since then, Russia has continued its military campaign, maintaining attacks along the roughly 1,000-mile front line and targeting civilian infrastructure. In some cases, it has stepped up its attacks on residential areas with no obvious military targets. An Associated Press tally based on reports from Ukrainian authorities found at least 117 civilians have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in Russian aerial attacks since March 11.",

The pope has not openly spoken about his racial identity, but historical records highlight a story of migration common to African American families leaving the racism of the Jim Crow South. Black and Creole Catholics in the U.S. say that a pope who holds these multiple identities is just what the Catholic Church needs to unify the global church and elevate the profile of Black Catholics, whose history and contributions, they say, have been overlooked.",

About half of Americans approve of how Trump has handled transgender issues, according to the survey \u2014 a relative high point for a president whose overall job approval is about 4 in 10. The poll also finds nuance in answers. Most oppose using federal insurance programs to pay for gender-affirming care for transgender young people, but more support allowing transgender military service members than oppose it. Democrats especially are divided in their views on transgender-related policies.",

The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed its uncontrolled entry. It was not immediately known where it came down or how much, if any, of the Kosmos 482 spacecraft survived the fiery descent through the atmosphere. Experts said ahead of time that some if not all of it might come crashing down, given it was built to withstand a landing on Venus. The chances of anyone being clobbered by the spacecraft debris were exceedingly low.",

A series of research papers released late last year chronicles the diminishment of the Southern accent among Black residents of the Atlanta area, white working-class people in the New Orleans area and people who grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. More than 5.8 million people have moved to the South in the 2020s. That's four times the combined amount of the three other regions.
