      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to the United Arab Emirates late Sunday as momentum grows for potential peace talks ending Moscow\u2019s war on the country. U.S. President Donald Trump last week suggested he would be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, long has been floated as a possible site for peace talks as well given the large population of Russian and Ukrainian expatriates who have flooded the country since the war began, and due to the Emirates\u2019 work on prisoner exchanges in the past.",

      "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron has called leaders from key European Union nations and the United Kingdom to his ornate Elysee Palace for an emergency meeting Monday. He wants to discuss how to deal with the Trump administration and step up plans to increase defense spending. The European leaders have been stunned by a weeklong diplomatic blitz on Ukraine from the Trump administration that seemed to embrace the Kremlin while it cold-shouldered many of its age-old European allies. There were belligerent warnings ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s reelection as U.S. president. But EU leaders publicly ignored the ominous forebodings and somehow hoped Trump would stand side by side with Europe.",

      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests. The proposal, which was a key part of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return. That's according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks. Zelenskyy\u2019s decision not to sign a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",

Peace Now said Monday the development would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Construction could begin as soon as next year. Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support.",

Delivering that fresh growth strategy is going to be the biggest challenge for the government that takes office after a snap national election set for Feb. 23. The nation that became known for the quality of its products has not seen real economic growth for five years. Business leaders complain about a shortage of skilled workers, too much bureaucracy and a lack of infrastructure upgrades. Rising competition from China and high energy prices due to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine also have left Europe\u2019s biggest economy mired in stagnation and angst about the future.",

      "description": "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients. The freeze has affected the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which annually contributes more than $400 million to South Africa\u2019s various HIV programs and non-governmental organizations. That's about 17% of the total funding. NGOs worry about patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths. Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. But many aid groups have already shut down.",

The National Weather Service warned of \u201clife-threatening cold\u201d into Tuesday, with temperatures in northeastern Montana predicted to dip as low as 45 degrees below zero. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued.",
