      "description": "Canadians are set to decide whether to extend the Liberal Party\u2019s decade in power or instead hand control to the Conservatives. They\u2019ll pick either Prime Minister Mark Carney or opposition leader Pierre Poilievre to lead the way forward, but Monday's election is also a referendum of sorts on a non-Canadian: Donald Trump. Until the American president won a second term and began threatening Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty, even suggesting the country should become the 51st state, the Liberals looked headed for defeat. But Trump\u2019s truculence has infuriated many Canadians and led to a tightening of the race. Whichever candidate becomes prime minister will face big challenges, including a trade war and resetting of Canada's relationship with the United States.",

      "description": "Power had almost fully returned to Spain early Tuesday morning as many questions remained about what caused one of Europe\u2019s most severe blackouts across Spain and Portugal. By 7:00a.m., Spanish electricity operator Red El\u00e9ctrica said that more than 99% of energy demand had been restored. Power had returned to several regions across Spain and Portugal as the nations reeled from the still-unexplained widespread blackout that had turned airports and train stations into campgrounds for stranded travelers. Monday night, many city residents, including in Spain\u2019s capital of Madrid, went to sleep in total darkness.",

The fighting early Tuesday left at least four people dead. The clashes in the southern suburb of Jaramana broke out after audio circulated on social media of a man attacking Islam\u2019s Prophet Muhammad. The audio was attributed to a Druze cleric, who later denied being involved.

Cardinal Angelo Becciu\u2019s status has dominated discussions in the days after Pope Francis\u2019 death amid questions about whether he would participate in the conclave to elect his successor.

On Tuesday, the 76-year-old Italian issued a statement through his lawyers that said he had \u201cdecided to obey\u201d the will of Pope Francis.",

      "description": "Chinese authorities say 22 people have been killed and 3 injured in a fire at restaurant in the northern city of Liaoyang. The fire broke out at around noon Tuesday, they said. No word was given on the cause of the fire, but images from the scene showed huge flames spurting from the windows and doors of the two- or three-story building. Industrial accidents occur frequently in China, usually due to staff ignoring safety features due to a lack of training or pressure from their superiors. If the fire began in the kitchen, it may be related to the traditional use of large open fires over which iron woks are used to braise dishes.",

Officials say the decision to shut 48 of the 87 government authorized resorts was a precautionary safety measure.

India has described the massacre as a \u201cterror attack\u201d and accused Pakistan of backing it. Pakistan has denied any connection to the attack. Both sides have since escalated the tensions by exchanging diplomatic and trade sanctions against each other and raising fears of a military conflict.",
