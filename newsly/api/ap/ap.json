      "description": "President Donald Trump faces ongoing questions about the Jeffrey Epstein case, overshadowing his administration's achievements. On Friday, reporters pressed the Republican president about pardoning Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, but he deflected, emphasizing his administration's successes. Despite enacting significant policies, Trump's past ties to Epstein continue to stir controversy. Supporters demand transparency, believing Epstein's death in a New York jail cell six years ago hides a larger conspiracy. Administration officials who previously fueled theories now claim there's nothing more to reveal. Trump denies prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and urges supporters to move on. But the Epstein case remains a challenging distraction.",

      "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell has finished 1 1/2 days of interviews with Justice Department officials. Maxwell's lawyer said Friday she answered questions \u201cabout 100 different people.\u201d Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term in Tallahassee, Florida, for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Maxwell's interview is related to the controversy about the Epstein investigation. The Justice Department says it won't release any more files after pledging otherwise. Maxwell's attorney says she answered questions \"truthfully.\" Officials say Epstein killed himself in his New York jail cell while awaiting trial in 2019, but his case has generated endless conspiracy theories because of his and Maxwell\u2019s links to famous people including Donald Trump.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts has prompted a major police operation. Thousands of officers in reflective yellow vests are patrolling around his Turnberry golf course to provide security and manage planned protests. The operation is expected to cost Scottish taxpayers millions of pounds. The union representing officers is concerned about the strain on already overworked police. Policing for Trump's previous visit to the U.K. in 2018 cost about $19 million. Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond says the operation involves local, national and specialist resources. Protests are planned in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries.",

DeSantis said Friday that the flights operated by the Department of Homeland Security have transferred about 100 detainees from the immigration detention center to other countries.

Santos and his lawyers have declined to comment, as has the federal Bureau of Prisons. Santos pleaded guilty last summer to federal wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.

However his well-documented racism and controversial behavior have resurfaced. Some fans struggle with his legacy, while others celebrate his achievements. Yet, his past use of racial slurs and political endorsements have left many questioning his sincerity. This reflects broader issues of race in wrestling and American society. Some fans remain devoted to the sport despite the contradictions.",

Over a decade ago, scientists said they'd discovered bacteria that uses the poisonous element arsenic to grow. Several research groups failed to replicate the results, saying it wasn\u2019t possible for a living thing to use something so toxic to make DNA and proteins. Thursday, the journal Science, which first published the research, retracted it, though not because of misconduct on the researchers\u2019 part.
