      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off. That's according to a memo Tuesday from the Office of Personnel Management. The memo follows an executive order Trump signed on his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government\u2019s diversity and inclusion programs that could touch on everything from anti-bias training to funding for minority farmers and homeowners. The memo directs agencies to place DEI office staffers on paid leave by 5 p.m. Wednesday, and take down all public DEI-focused webpages by the same deadline.",

Trump on Tuesday defended his decision to use his first hours in office to pardon hundreds of people who participated in violence at the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, including the former leaders of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, who were convicted of seditious conspiracy charges but released from prison after Trump signed his order.",

In less than two days, the Republican president has moved to end diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government, withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate accords, blocked a federal law banning TikTok, and sought to end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship. Each of those actions enrages part of the Democratic base. Together, they make it difficult to formulate a response by an already fractured party.",

The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president\u2019s help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems. Trump has promised a lighter regulatory touch and picked pro-crypto officials for key government positions. By associating himself so closely with meme coins, some crypto fans worry that Trump hurts his chances to help the wider crypto industry.",

One extremist group saw it as a rallying cry for their movement. Hate watchdogs said it was unclear what Musk was trying to convey and urged caution. Musk himself was dismissive of the critics who saw it as a Nazi salute, though he didn't offer further explanation.

School was canceled Tuesday for students in areas more used to hurricane dismissals than snow days. The storm has prompted the first ever blizzard warnings for several coastal counties near the Texas-Louisiana border. Heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain are expected around the Deep South as a blast of Arctic air plunges much of the Midwest and the eastern U.S. into a deep freeze. Nearly 2,000 flights to, from or within the U.S. have been canceled and about 10,000 more are delayed.",
