      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s most controversial Cabinet nominees have flooded the zone Thursday in back-to-back-to-back confirmation hearings. Conspiracy theories about vaccines. Secret meetings with dictators. An enemies list. It was a blockbuster showing like nothing the Senate has seen in modern memory. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel all faced grilling over their views and promises in testy exchanges. The whirlwind day \u2014 Day 10 of the new White House \u2014 unfolded as Trump himself was unloading racist theories about how diversity initiatives caused the tragic airplane-and-helicopter crash outside Washington\u2019s Ronald Reagan National Airport.",

      "description": "The Senate has confirmed billionaire Doug Burgum as interior secretary. Lawmakers on Thursday voted 79-18 in favor of Burgum. President Donald Trump tapped the two-term North Dakota governor to spearhead Republican ambitions to boost fossil fuel production. He succeeds Deb Haaland, who curbed oil and gas lease sales and promoted wind and solar projects for the Biden administration. Trump wants to move in the opposite direction and Burgum is tasked with making it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources. That\u2019s raised alarms among environmentalists and some Democrats as greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels bake the planet.",

Now that Burgum is nominated to be President Donald Trump's secretary of the Interior Department, those relationships are drawing a closer look. Many of the oil and gas companies Burgum developed a rapport with are certain to want things from him following his Senate confirmation to the post. A spokesman says the Republican routinely \"met with job creators and leaders who generated opportunities for the people of North Dakota.\u201d",

The reassurances were aimed at blunting a persistent line of attack from Democrats. Throughout Thursday\u2019s hearing they confronted Patel with a vast catalog of his incendiary statements. They said those statements raise alarming questions about his loyalty to the president, including referring to some of the Jan. 6 rioters as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and calling for a purge of anti-Trump \u201cconspirators\u201d in the government and news media.",

      "description": "U.S. officials have approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioids. The Food and Drug Administration approved the pill from Vertex Pharmaceuticals for acute pain that often occurs after surgery or injuries. It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in 20 years. But the medication\u2019s modest effectiveness shows just how challenging it is to find new ways of managing pain. Vertex's drug was better than a dummy pill at reducing pain after surgery, but it didn't outperform opioid treatment. Vertex is studying the drug for a number of other conditions, including chronic nerve pain.",

The hostages were shuttled through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants. Israel later began releasing 110 Palestinian prisoners after the swap was initially put on hold by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He demanded that mediators assure the safe exit for hostages going forward. He said later that he had received that commitment.",

Officials said it was likely to be the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the jet late Wednesday as it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. John Donnelly is the fire chief in the nation\u2019s capital. He says authorities are now switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation.",

Those fears materialized Wednesday night when an American Airlines plane collided with a military helicopter, taking the lives of 67 people, including three soldiers and more than a dozen figure skaters. Even in peak flying conditions, experts say, the airspace around Reagan Washington National Airport can challenge the most experienced pilots, who must navigate hundreds of other commercial planes, military aircraft and restricted areas around sensitive sites.",

On Thursday, dozens of doctors, nurses and representatives from Israel and Thailand waved flags, sang, and cheered as the five Thai citizens stepped off a military helicopter and entered a hospital outside Tel Aviv, where they will spend a few days undergoing medical tests and recuperating. Three Israelis were also released on Thursday, and Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners in the exchange. The five Thai nationals were in fair health, doctors said. Hamas militants kidnapped 31 Thai nationals during the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel, making them the largest group of foreigners held captive.",
