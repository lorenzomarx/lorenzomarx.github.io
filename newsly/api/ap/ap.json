      "description": "President Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts has prompted a major police operation. Thousands of officers in reflective yellow vests are patrolling around his Turnberry golf course to provide security and manage planned protests. The operation is expected to cost Scottish taxpayers millions of pounds. The union representing officers is concerned about the strain on already overworked police. Policing for Trump's previous visit to the U.K. in 2018 cost about $19 million. Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond says the operation involves local, national and specialist resources. Protests are planned in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries.",

This decision highlights differences among the European allies on addressing the humanitarian crisis and ending the Israel-Hamas war. Germany and Britain support a Palestinian state in principle but have not followed France's lead. The situation in Gaza has caused alarm among Israel's allies, with calls for urgent action to address the crisis and build lasting peace.",

DeSantis said Friday that the flights operated by the Department of Homeland Security have transferred about 100 detainees from the immigration detention center to other countries. He expects that number to increase soon. Officials say two or three flights have happened, though they didn't say which countries those flights headed to. Critics have condemned the facility as cruel and inhumane, but DeSantis and other Republicans have defended it as part of the state\u2019s aggressive push to support President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",

The Republican president withdrew Habba's nomination for the permanent position Thursday, allowing her to transition from interim U.S. attorney to acting U.S. attorney for 210 days. Habba announced her new role on social media, emphasizing her commitment to justice. Earlier in the week, judges had declined to extend Habba's tenure, appointing Desiree Leigh Grace instead. However, Grace was later removed by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Habba's office has been involved in several high-profile cases, including against Democratic Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep.

However his well-documented racism and controversial behavior have resurfaced. Some fans struggle with his legacy, while others celebrate his achievements. Yet, his past use of racial slurs and political endorsements have left many questioning his sincerity. This reflects broader issues of race in wrestling and American society.
