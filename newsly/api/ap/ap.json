      "description": "A massive search is stretching into its second day for a man who authorities say posed as a police officer and fatally shot a Democratic state lawmaker in her suburban Minneapolis home. Authorities say the suspect also shot and wounded a second lawmaker. Authorities have identified him as 57-year-old Vance Boelter. Melissa Hortman, a former Minnesota House Speaker, and her husband were fatally shot early Saturday in their Brooklyn Park home. The second state lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife were shot multiple times in nearby Champlin. Gov. Tim Walz has called it \u201ca politically motivated assassination.\u201d The FBI has issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to Boelter's arrest and conviction.",

      "description": "Iran has fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel, triggering air raid sirens across the country as emergency services reported at least five killed and dozens more wounded in the fourth day of a conflict between the regional foes that showed no sign of slowing. Powerful explosions, likely from Israel\u2019s defense systems intercepting Iranian missiles, rocked Tel Aviv shortly before dawn on Monday. Plumes of black smoke rose into the sky over the major coastal city. The latest salvo comes after a weekend of escalating tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran that raised fears of a wider, more dangerous regional war.",

Iran announced it had launched some 100 missiles and vowed further retaliation for Israel\u2019s surprise attack on its nuclear program and military leadership, which has killed at least 224 in the country since it began last Friday. In announcing the latest salvo after a weekend of escalating tit-for-tat attacks, Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard vowed that further rounds of strikes would be \u201cmore forceful, severe, precise and destructive than previous ones.\u201d",

      "description": "When U.S. President Donald Trump last came to Canada for a Group of Seven summit, the enduring image was of him seated with his arms folded defiantly as then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel stared daggers at him. If there is a shared mission at this year\u2019s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains, it's a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions. Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There's little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.",

      "description": "No-bid contracts with politically connected companies have become crucial to the Republican Trump administration\u2019s push for more space to hold immigrants for deportation. Those contracts include one for a now-shuttered private prison in Kansas. An agreement with Tennessee-based private prison firm CoreCivic for reopening a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, is part of a surge of contracts issued by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without seeking competitive bids first. ICE cites a \u201ccompelling urgency\u201d for more detention beds for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. ICE's moves have delighted industry analysts on company earnings calls and promised bigger profits but have also drawn criticism. Skeptical city officials argue CoreCivic needs a special use permit.",

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Monday that radiation levels outside the complex are presently normal. Grossi said that the radiation poses a significant danger if uranium is inhaled or ingested. He added that the risk can be effectively managed with appropriate protective measures, such as using respiratory protection devices while inside the facilities. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show extensive damage at Natanz after Friday's strikes.",

      "description": "A new poll shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs Republicans in Congress have focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare. They\u2019re more divided on spending around the military and border security. As Republican senators debate President Donald Trump\u2019s bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, the survey points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate.",

      "description": "Nearly 3,000 white crosses on a hill in South Africa are a memorial to white people killed on farms over the last three decades. It's a visceral snapshot seized on by some in South Africa to drive a discredited narrative that white farmers in the majority Black country are being targeted in a widespread, race-based system of persecution. The false narrative has been amplified by South African-born Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump. Yet the killings of farmers and farmworkers, regardless of race, are a tiny percentage of the country\u2019s high level of crime. And research shows that robbery \u2014 not racial animus \u2014 is the most common motive for violent crimes on farms.",
