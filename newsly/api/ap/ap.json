      "description": "A divided Supreme Court has ruled that individual judges lack the authority to grant nationwide injunctions, but the decision leaves unclear the fate of President Donald Trump\u2019s restrictions on birthright citizenship. The outcome Friday was a victory for Trump, who has complained about individual judges throwing up obstacles to his agenda. But a conservative majority left open the possibility that the birthright citizenship changes could remain blocked nationwide. The Republican president\u2019s order would deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of people who are in the country illegally.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court has ruled that Maryland parents who have religious objections can pull their children from public school lessons using LGBTQ storybooks. The justices Friday reversed lower-court rulings in favor of the Montgomery County school system in suburban Washington. The high court ruled that the schools likely could not require elementary school children to sit through lessons involving the books if parents expressed religious objections to the material. The decision was not a final ruling in the case, but the justices strongly suggested that the parents will win in the end. The court ruled that policies like the one at issue in the case are subjected to the strictest level of review, nearly always dooming them.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law aimed at blocking kids from seeing pornography online. The high court handed down the ruling Friday. More than a dozen states have passed similar age verification laws as smartphones and other devices make it easier to access online porn, including hardcore obscene material. An industry trade group challenged the Texas law after the adult-content site Pornhub shut down in several states. The group said the law puts an unfair burden on adults by requiring them to submit personal information that could be vulnerable to hacking or tracking. Texas says modern age checks are safe and important for protecting children.",

Trump himself gave Congress some breathing room as senators race to meet his Fourth of July deadline, saying that date is \u201cnot the end all.\u201d With their majority control of Congress, Republicans are trying to push the package past unified Democratic opposition. To do so, they are working through a punch list of still-unsettled issues, including Medicaid health care cuts. Republicans are relying on steep reductions in programs to help pay for $3.8 trillion in tax breaks.",
