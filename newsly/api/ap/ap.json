      "description": "Thousands of U.S. Agency for International Development workers who've been fired or placed on leave as part of the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the agency are being given a brief window Thursday and Friday to clear out their workspaces. USAID has been among the biggest targets of a broad campaign by President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash the size of the federal government. Many USAID workers see the Republican administration\u2019s terms for retrieving their belongings as insulting. The employees have been instructed not to bring weapons, including firearms, \u201cspear guns\u201d and \u201chand grenades.\u201d The workers are being given 15 minutes at their former workstations.",

      "description": "The Trump administration says it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world. That\u2019s according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press as well as court filings Wednesday. They detail the outcome of a 90-day review ordered by President Donald Trump of all the money provided by USAID and the State Department for development and aid work overseas. The move leaves few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court late Wednesday temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid.",

      "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday. The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals whose cancellation would save $2 billion. The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 of contracts up for cancellation, and it shows the cuts would have affected everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. It underscores how the administration\u2019s approach to broad swath spending cuts have had immediate and potentially unintended consequences.",

The bloc also said that it would vigorously fight a wholesale tariff of 25% on all EU products headed for the United States.

Under the ceasefire agreement reached last month, Israel was to begin withdrawing from the so-called Philadelphi corridor on Saturday and complete the pullout within eight days. Its refusal to do so would likely be seen by Hamas and key mediator Egypt as a breach of the agreement. An Israeli official said the military needed to remain in the corridor to prevent weapons smuggling.",
