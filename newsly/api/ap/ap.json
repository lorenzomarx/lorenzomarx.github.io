      "description": "The Trump administration has presented a plan to dramatically cut staffing worldwide for U.S. aid projects as part of its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The proposal would leave fewer than 300 workers out of 8,000 direct-hires and contractors. Two current USAID employees and one former senior USAID official told The Associated Press of the administration\u2019s plan. It was presented to remaining senior officials of the agency Thursday. They spoke on condition of anonymity, in the face of a Trump administration order barring USAID staffers from talking to anyone outside their agency.",

      "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s decision to close the U.S. Agency for International Development has drawn widespread criticism from congressional Democrats. The move also raised questions about the influence billionaire ally Elon Musk wields over the federal government. The United States is the world\u2019s largest source of foreign assistance by far, although several European countries allocate a much bigger share of their budgets. USAID funds projects in some 120 countries aimed at fighting epidemics, educating children, providing clean water and supporting other areas of development. The impact of the U.S. decision is hitting projects around the world, from efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest to HIV prevention in South Africa and hospitals in war-ravaged Syria.",

The decision Thursday comes hours before the midnight deadline for workers to apply for the program. U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. in Boston sided with several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan orchestrated by Trump adviser Elon Musk. The Republican president is trying to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. The judge didn't express an opinion on the legality of the program. He scheduled a hearing for Monday and directed administration officials to extend the deadline to apply for the program until after the hearing.",
