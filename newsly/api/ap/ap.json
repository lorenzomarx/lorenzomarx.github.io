      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a peace agreement. Zelenskyy said that if the deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely apply pressure on both sides. Zelenskyy spoke to reporters on Friday, with his comments embargoed until Saturday morning. He said the Americans want the war to end by the beginning of summer. They plan to do everything possible to achieve this goal and seek a clear schedule of events.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken an unusual step of turning to military leaders for high-level diplomacy. The top U.S. commander in the Middle East is involved in talks over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Trump's Army secretary is engaged in negotiations on trying to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It's not clear whether the military leaders were brought in because of their expertise, connections or to signal potentially tougher options. But the move reflects how the Trump administration has upended traditional U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy. Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are balancing both sets of difficult negotiations.",

      "description": "India and the United States have released a framework for an interim trade agreement to lower tariffs on Indian goods. The joint statement, released Friday, follows U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement to reduce import tariffs on India. This comes six months after imposing taxes to press New Delhi to cut its reliance on Russian crude. Under the deal, tariffs on Indian goods would drop to 18% from 25%. India would also reduce tariffs on U.S. goods. The agreement aims to support resilient supply chains. However, Indian opposition parties argue it favors the U.S. and impacts sensitive sectors like agriculture.",

      "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein files have rocked Europe's elite, revealing ties to a prince, an ambassador, and top politicians. The U.S. Department of Justice released documents that have ended careers and sparked investigations. King Charles III's brother lost his titles and home. Ex-U.K. ambassador Peter Mandelson was fired and may face prison. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is in crisis for appointing Mandelson. Norway, Sweden and Slovakia have seen senior figures fall. Experts say the files expose Epstein's powerful network in Europe. The fallout contrasts with a more limited impact so far in the U.S. where only a handful of prominent Epstein associates have lost their jobs.",

      "description": "Democrats are focusing on health care in the November elections and making it a key issue. Republicans have cut Medicaid through new work requirements and they've declined to extend COVID-era subsidies. That's led to increased costs for people covered under Affordable Care Act plans. Democrats are using campaign ads and personal stories to emphasize the impact on Americans. Jon Ossoff is one high-profile Democrat in a tough reelection campaign this year. The Georgia senator plans to address health care at an event Saturday. Republicans have struggled to pass legislation to offset health costs and that's become weak point for them. Democrats see a chance to gain political leverage in the midterms.",

Alberto Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n says federal agents began hitting him right after they pulled him from a vehicle. He was hospitalized with eight skull fractures and five life-threatening brain hemorrhages. Officers claimed he ran into a wall, but medical staff immediately doubted that account. His case has sparked calls for accountability and transparency. Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n, who entered the U.S. legally, faces a long recovery and uncertain future. He hopes to stay in the U.S. and support his family despite fears of another encounter with ICE.",

That word comes from two Trump administration officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting hasn't yet been formally announced and details of its agenda are still being determined. It's not clear how many leaders will come.",

The condition is a quivering or irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke and heart failure. Experts say more than 10 million Americans have it, mostly older adults. Symptoms include a pounding heartbeat and shortness of breath. Smartwatches and other devices are helping with diagnosis. Causes include genetics, high blood pressure and stress.
