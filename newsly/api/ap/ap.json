      "description": "Protesters in Israel have torched tires and blocked highways to demand a ceasefire to free hostages in Gaza. This comes as Israeli leaders push for an offensive against Hamas. The protest Tuesday follows deadly strikes on Gaza's main hospital that killed 20 people, including medics and journalists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected meet his cabinet later on Tuesday. Relatives of hostages hope steady pressure can push the government to commit to ceasefire talks. But far-right coalition members have threatened to bolt if Israel agrees to a truce. Most hostages taken on October 7, 2023, have been released, but 50 remain in captivity in Gaza.",

      "description": "Opposition figures in Uganda have criticized a deal with the U.S. to accept deported migrants. They question the lack of parliamentary approval and suggest it eases political pressure on President Yoweri Museveni. Ugandan officials have shared few details, but have said they prefer deportees of African origin without criminal records. Still, U.S. officials say they are processing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national charged with human smuggling, for deportation to Uganda. Critics argue the agreement benefits Museveni politically and economically. The deal comes amid U.S. sanctions on Ugandan officials over corruption and rights abuses. The lack of transparency and parliamentary oversight has raised concerns.",

The Maryland construction worker became the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous. A judge in Tennessee determined that Abrego Garcia wasn\u2019t a danger or flight risk. He was released from jail on Friday. The Trump administration has said it will try to deport him before his trial.",

Trump said in a letter posted Monday on his Truth Social platform that he is firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Cook had said she wouldn\u2019t leave her post despite Trump previously calling for her to resign.",

The announcement came after trading closed Monday on Wall Street, where benchmarks reversed some of their big gains from last week. Trump announced his plan to dismiss Cook on his Truth Social platform. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.8% after setting a record on Friday. The Nasdaq composite shed 0.2%. Apart from rattling financial markets, Trump's latest move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court.
