      "description": "A month after Iran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests, widespread arrests are roiling the country. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up. Activists say those who are arrested are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000 and the number of the deaths at more than 7,000.",

Minneapolis will now need to decide how to manage the makeshift memorial sites for two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents.

A spokesperson for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey says it was \u201ctoo early\u201d for the city to comment on the future of the memorial sites. It took the city five years to determine plans for a permanent memorial site for George Floyd after he was murdered by a police officer in 2020.",
