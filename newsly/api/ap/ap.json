The dismissal of the case against Dr. Eithan Haim in U.S. district court in Houston on Friday comes as the Trump administration in its first week has already issued executive orders rolling back transgender rights.

The state claims commissioner issued the wrongful incarceration award in the case of Richard Lapointe after years of legal battles between his lawyers and the state. Lapointe, who had a mental disability, died in 2020 at the age of 74, five years after the state Supreme Supreme Court overturned his conviction in the 1987 killing of his wife's 88-year-old grandmother. Lapointe's lawyer said Friday it is sad he didn't live long enough to see the award, which awaits legislative approval.",

Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote Friday in a late-night session. Republicans had pushed back questions about Hegseth's qualifications amid allegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behavior toward women. Hegseth himself was working the phones to shore up support with senators. The Republican senators are prioritizing the former Fox News host and combat veteran\u2019s vow to create a \u201cwarrior culture\u201d at the Pentagon. Hegseth's confirmation rounds out President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security Cabinet officials.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is heading to hurricane-battered western North Carolina and wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles. It's the first trip of his second term. Trump has frequently blended politics and disasters, and Friday will likely be no different. He has sharply criticized President Joe Biden's administration for its handling of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and he's suggested withholding money from California unless it changes water policies. Trump will follow those stops with a Saturday victory rally in Las Vegas, where he plans to start detailing how he can begin keeping a campaign promise to exclude tips from federal taxes.",

That's according to a person familiar with the matter. Fauci is the latest in a string of former Trump aides-turned-critics to see their federal protection canceled despite ongoing threats to their lives. Speaking to reporters Friday in North Carolina, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t feel any responsibility if harm befell the former government officials. A person familiar with the matter says Fauci\u2019s federal security detail was ended on Thursday and he has since hired private security.",

      "description": "Like most presidents, Donald Trump faces an economy that seldom bends to political ambitions. The Republican has promised strong growth, high tariffs, income tax cuts and booming oilfields. But despite the solid job market and low 4.1% unemployment rate, he has to contend with headwinds like inflation, a budget deficit, increased tensions over trade, the fallout from his plans to curtail immigration and a persistent wealth gap. Each of these issues could help to shape how voters feel about a president they returned to the White House with the specific goal of fixing the economy.",
