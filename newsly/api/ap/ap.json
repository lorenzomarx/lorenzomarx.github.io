      "description": "Key Republicans and Democrats have been stalwart supporters of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But a blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to sign a deal Friday that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Instead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance further splintered American political support for Ukraine. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has backed Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster.\"",

      "description": "Ukrainians have rallied around President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a defender of their country\u2019s interests in the hours after he left the White House after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump. Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy during an Oval Office meeting on Friday for what they saw as a lack of gratitude for past U.S. aid, a confrontation that pleased Moscow. The friction cast doubt on future U.S. support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia. But despite the diplomatic fallout, many Ukrainians supported Zelenskyy\u2019s firm stance. Officials across Ukraine praised their leader's resilience, while some cautioned against losing crucial U.S. backing.",

It also shows the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect U.S. foreign policy priorities toward his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term. The episode has left in doubt the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia.",

The argument, broadcast globally on Friday, was perhaps unique in American history. It led to the rest of Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit being canceled and called into question how much the U.S. will still support Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.",

It remained unclear whether the talks would resume. The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.",

Critics of Trump, Musk and their cost-cutting initiative known as DOGE hope to discourage and stigmatize Tesla purchases, ultimately denting Musk\u2019s fortune. Shares in Tesla, the world\u2019s most valuable automaker, make up a significant portion of Musk\u2019s wealth.",
