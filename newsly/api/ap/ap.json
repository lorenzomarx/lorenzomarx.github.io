      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that Russia has launched a major attack on Ukraine with around 450 drones and 70 missiles. The strikes reported Tuesday came a day before U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi. Zelenskyy said that Russia targeted the power grid again in five regions of Ukraine in a bid to deny civilians light, heating and water during a harsh winter. At least 10 people were wounded. Zelenskyy urged allies to send more air defense supplies and increase pressure on Russia. Talks between Moscow and Kyiv have been described as constructive. But a comprehensive settlement remains distant.",

      "description": "State and local officials are pushing back against federal plans to expand immigrant detention facilities. President Donald Trump's administration is scouting locations across the U.S. for new sites, sparking protests and legal challenges. In Minnesota, fatal shootings during immigration enforcement have intensified scrutiny on ICE. In Virginia, a proposed detention center drew hundreds of people to a tense public hearing. Kansas City officials have passed a moratorium attempt to block a new ICE detention site. Meanwhile, New Mexico's legislature is advancing a bill to ban state and local contracts for ICE facilities. A law Trump signed last year includes $45 billion to expand ice detention facilities.",
