      "description": "European leaders will join Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his crucial meeting with President Donald Trump, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday. The move in relation to the key White House meeting on Monday is an apparent effort to prevent a repeat of the heated encounter Zelenskyy faced when he met Trump in February. Von der Leyen, head of the European Union\u2019s executive branch, posted on X that \u201cat the request of President Zelenskyy, I will join the meeting with President Trump and other European leaders in the White House tomorrow.\u201d",

      "description": "Special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff says Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO\u2019s collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war. Witkoff told CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that \u201cthe United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO.\u201d Witkoff said was the first time he had heard Putin agree to that.",

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum organized a \u201cday of stoppage\" on Sunday as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces pressure over stalled hostage talks and a new Gaza offensive. Protesters fear further fighting could endanger the 50 hostages believed to remain in Gaza, only about 20 of whom are thought to be alive. Netanyahu has demanded the unconditional and immediate release of the hostages but is balancing competing pressures, haunted by the potential for mutiny within his coalition.",

      "description": "Relations between Beirut and Damascus remain tense \u2014 as they have been for decades past, a time during which Syria failed to treat its smaller neighbor as a sovereign nation. A lot has happened on both sides of the Lebanon-Syria border. A lightning offensive by Islamist insurgents in Syria toppled longtime autocrat Bashar Assad last December and brought a new government in place in Damascus. In Lebanon, a bruising war with Israel dealt a serious blow to Hezbollah and a U.S.-negotiated deal has brought a fragile ceasefire. Still, even with the fall of Syria's 54-year Assad family rule and the events in Lebanon of the past year, attempts to reset Lebanese-Syrian political ties have been slow to take hold.",

But, those accomplishments, which they felt were already overlooked, became further buried this week with the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented law enforcement takeover in the nation\u2019s capital. President Donald Trump has deployed the first of 800 National Guard members to Washington, D.C. But, the Republican president is setting his sights on other cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland, California. One thing they all have in common: They're led by Black mayors. The federal government\u2019s actions have heightened some of these mayors\u2019 desires to champion the strategies they\u2019ve used to help make their cities safer.",
