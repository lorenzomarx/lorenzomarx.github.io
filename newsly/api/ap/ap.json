      "description": "President Donald Trump says he will use a detention center at Guantanamo Bay to hold tens of thousands of criminal immigrants in the U.S. illegally who can\u2019t be sent back to their home countries. While the U.S. naval base is best known for the suspects brought in after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it also has a separate facility used for decades to hold detained immigrants. The U.S. has leased Guantanamo from Cuba for more than a century. Cuba opposes the lease and typically rejects the nominal U.S. rent payments. Trump signed a presidential memorandum and said he'd direct federal officials to get facilities ready. Border czar Tom Homan said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would run the facility. Still, details of the plan weren\u2019t immediately clear.",

The Laken Riley Act will require the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Under the law signed Wednesday, federal officials will be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes like shoplifting, assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone.",

The exchange expected Thursday would be the third since the start of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that has held for a week and a half. The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel sparked the fighting. It has held despite a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages were released.",
