      "description": "Israeli warplanes pounded Iran\u2019s capital overnight, hitting a facility used to make uranium centrifuges and another that made missile components, the Israeli military said. It said it had intercepted 10 missiles, as Iran\u2019s retaliatory barrages have diminished since the start of the conflict. Israel has carried out blistering attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and military sites since launching its surprise bombardment on Friday. A Washington-based Iranian human rights group said at least 585 people, including 239 civilians, have been killed and more than 1,300 wounded. Iran has fired some 400 missiles and hundreds of drones in retaliatory strikes that have killed at least 24 people in Israel and wounded hundreds.",

      "description": "In Iran\u2019s capital city, the streets are empty, businesses closed, communications patchy at best. Panicked masses spend restless nights on the floors of metro stations as strikes boom overhead. The country is just under a week into a fierce Israeli blitz to destroy the country\u2019s nuclear program and its military capabilities. Thousands have fled Tehran, spending hours in gridlock as they head toward the suburbs, the Caspian Sea, or even Armenia or Turkey. But others are stuck in high-rise apartment buildings. They worry and so do their relatives elsewhere.",

The finds on Wednesday brought the death toll from the attack on the Ukrainian capital the previous day to 28. Authorities said that 23 of those killed were inside the building in one of Kyiv\u2019s districts that took a direct hit and collapsed. It was the deadliest single attack on Kyiv so far this year. Russia fired more than 440 drones and 32 missiles in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the biggest bombardments of the war, now in its fourth year.",

The justices\u2019 6-3 decision Wednesday effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to the one in Tennessee. Chief Justice John Roberts writes for a conservative majority the law does not violate the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same. Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissent joined by her liberal colleagues that the majority \u201cabandons transgender children and their families to political whims.\u201d",
