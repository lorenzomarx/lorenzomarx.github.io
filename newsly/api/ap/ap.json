      "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine three years ago has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Tens of thousands have been killed, cities have been reduced to ruins, millions of Ukrainians became refugees, and Russia was isolated from the West. Now as top Russian and U.S. officials are talking again and setting the stage for summit meeting, Putin appears closer than ever to cementing Moscow\u2019s gains of about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory and keeping the country out of NATO. President Donald Trump reversed the U.S. policy of isolating Russia, saying they have agreed \u201cto work together very closely\u201d to end the war. He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwill be involved\u201d but didn\u2019t elaborate.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives. His comments caused outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger Russian military. Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator without elections\u201d and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from Russia, and some of what Trump has said does echo Russia\u2019s own narrative of the conflict.",

      "description": "NATO members are continuing their largest combat exercises of 2025 amid concern within the 32-nation alliance over its most powerful member, the United States. The drills in Romania come as a shaken Europe grapples with a new U.S. course under President Donald Trump. His defense secretary has demanded that allies dramatically ramp up military spending and said U.S. security priorities lie elsewhere. That cast doubts on Washington\u2019s longstanding security guarantees provided to Europe. The NATO exercises also come days before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

The rhetoric from Trump toward Ukraine comes amid an escalating back-and-forth between the two presidents and rising tensions between the United States and much of Europe over Trump\u2019s approach to settling the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II. Trump\u2019s broadside came not long after Zelenskyy\u2019s comment that Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he tries to bring the fighting to a close on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow.",

It's a vote that could place Patel atop the nation\u2019s premier federal law enforcement agency despite concerns from Democrats over his qualifications and the prospect that he would do President Donald Trump\u2019s bidding. Patel cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee last week by a 12-10, party-line vote and is set for consideration by the Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday afternoon. He is expected to be confirmed unless more than three Republican senators defy Trump\u2019s will and vote against him, which is seen as unlikely.",

      "description": "German voters go to the polls Sunday to elect a parliament that will determine who runs the country for the next four years. Germany has Europe\u2019s biggest economy and is the EU\u2019s most populous nation. It is a leading member of NATO and the second-biggest weapons supplier to Ukraine. The vote count is likely to be final early Monday, but it's not clear what governing coalitions are possible. Preelection polling shows a mainstream conservative bloc with about 30% support and the far-right Alternative for Germany with around 20%. Parties need to get 5% of the vote to win seats, so how many reach that threshold may determine the coalition's makeup. All mainstream parties say they won\u2019t work with AfD.",

Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for other acting roles.

The boys and their mother were abducted from a kibbutz on Oct. 7, 2023, and became a symbol of the country\u2019s anguish. Hamas had claimed the family was killed in an Israeli airstrike, but their fate remained unclear for months. The father was freed earlier this month in a ceasefire deal. Images of the red-haired children circulated widely and their ordeal fueled calls for the release of all the hostages taken by Hamas. The remains will now be formally identified.",
