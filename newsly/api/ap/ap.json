      "description": "Vice President JD Vance said Elon Musk was making a mistake going after President Donald Trump in a storm of bitter and inflammatory social media posts after a falling out between the two men. But the vice president, in an interview released Friday after the very public blow up between the world\u2019s richest man and arguably the world\u2019s most powerful, also tried to downplay Musk\u2019s blistering attacks as an \u201cemotional guy\u201d who got frustrated. Vance\u2019s comments come as other Republicans in recent days have urged the two men, who months ago were close allies spending significant time together, to mend fences.",

      "description": "A large Russian drone-and-missile attack has targeted Ukraine\u2019s eastern city of Kharkiv, killing at least three people and injuring 21. Local Ukrainian officials said the attack on Saturday included deadly aerial glide bombs. Kharkiv\u2019s mayor Ihor Terekhov said the barrage also damaged 18 apartment buildings and 13 private homes. Citing preliminary data, he said Russia used 48 Shahed drones, two missiles and four aerial glide bombs in the attack. The intensity of the Russian attacks on Ukraine over the past weeks has further dampened hopes that the warring sides could reach a peace deal anytime soon days \u2014 especially after Kyiv recently embarrassed the Kremlin with a surprising drone attack on military airfields deep inside Russia.",

The Prime Minister\u2019s office said Saturday that the body of Thai citizen Nattapong Pinta was returned to Israel in a special military operation. Pinta was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity near the start of the war, said the government. Thais were the largest group of foreigners held captive by Hamas militants. This comes two days after the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages were retrieved. Fifty-five hostages remain in Gaza, of whom Israel says more than half are dead.",

Abrego Garcia appeared Friday in court for the first time since he was expelled, facing new charges related to a large human smuggling operation.

Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife and lawyers offer a much different story, saying the now 29-year-old had as a teenager fled local gangs that terrorized his family for a life in Maryland.",

      "description": "Call it the 911 presidency. Despite insisting that the United States has rebounded from calamity under his watch, President Donald Trump is harnessing emergency powers unlike any of his predecessors. Whether it\u2019s leveling punishing tariffs, deploying troops to the border or sidelining environmental regulations, Trump has relied on rules and laws intended only for use in extraordinary circumstances like war and invasion. An analysis by The Associated Press shows that 20% of Trump\u2019s 150 executive orders have included some kind of emergency declaration, a proportion that far exceed those issued by any other recent president during entire four-year terms.",

He found one in a luxury jumbo jet that Qatar was willing to sell \u2014 and now may be turning into a divisive gift. Assuming legal issues around the transfer are resolved, the next question is how long it will take to refurbish the Boeing 747 for presidential travel. That could span years and cost billions of dollars, meaning he might not get to use the plane during his term. If he\u2019s in a rush and wants to cut corners, it\u2019s a matter of how much risk he\u2019s willing to take.",
