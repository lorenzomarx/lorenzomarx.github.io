      "description": "The Trump administration has ended use of the border app called CBP One that allowed nearly 1 million people to legally enter the United States. Shortly after Donald Trump's swearing-in, messages told migrants waiting in Mexico that their appointments were canceled. The reverberations of CBP One's sudden end sent shock waves across Mexico. Hope and excitement evaporated into feelings of despair and disbelief for migrants who pulled suitcases crammed with clothing and stuffed animals to occupy their children. Tears ran down her cheeks of a Colombian woman who said, \u201cWe don't know what we are going to do.\u201d",

      "description": "The Senate has passed a bill that would require federal authorities to detain migrants accused of theft and violent crimes. It's the first measure that President Donald Trump likely will sign into law and gives more weight to his plans to deport millions of migrants. Trump has made a broad crackdown on illegal immigration his top priority. And Congress, with Republicans in control and some Democrats willing to go along, is showing it's ready to follow suit. The Laken Riley Act is named after a Georgia nursing student whose murder by a Venezuelan man last year became a rallying cry for Trump\u2019s White House campaign.",

      "description": "For millions in the U.S. illegally or with temporary legal status, the start of Donald Trump\u2019s second term as president comes with a feeling their time in the U.S. may end soon. Trump made mass deportations a signature issue of his campaign and has promised a raft of orders to remake immigration policy when he takes office Monday. Plans for deportation arrests appear to be in flux after news leaked of an operation in Chicago this week. Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan said on Fox News Sunday that Chicago was not off the table, but officials were reconsidering when and how to conduct enforcement. So-called sanctuary cities such as Chicago, which limit how local police cooperate with federal immigration authorities, have been a favorite Trump target.",

The militant group has not only survived Israel\u2019s 15-month military campaign \u2014 among the deadliest and most destructive in recent memory \u2014 but it remains firmly in control of the coastal territory that now resembles an apocalyptic wasteland. For all the might it deployed in Gaza, Israel failed to remove Hamas from power, one of its central war aims. That makes a return to fighting more likely, but the results might be the same.",

The pardons were expected after Trump\u2019s yearslong campaign to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack that left more than 100 police officers injured and threatened the peaceful transfer of power. Trump says he is also commuting the sentences of six defendants, though the White House did not immediately provide further details.",
