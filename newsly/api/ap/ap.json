      "description": "Health officials in Gaza say Israeli strikes have killed at least 34 Palestinians. The bloodshed comes a day after Israel eased aid restrictions due to a worsening humanitarian crisis. On Sunday, Israel announced a pause in military operations in certain areas for 10 hours daily to improve aid flow. Despite these measures, Israel continues military operations outside the pause timeframe. Aid agencies welcomed the new measures but say they are insufficient. Images of emaciated children have sparked global outrage. Most of Gaza's population now relies on aid and accessing food has become increasingly dangerous.",

      "description": "The U.N. General Assembly is bringing high-level officials together to promote a two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel and its close ally the United States are boycotting the meeting, which will be co-chaired by the foreign ministers of France and Saudi Arabia. Israel\u2019s right-wing government opposes a two-state solution, and the United States has called the meeting \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to its efforts to end the war in Gaza. France and Saudi Arabia want the meeting to put a spotlight on the two-state solution, which they view as the only viable road map to peace, and to start addressing the steps to get there.",

The fighting, which began last Thursday after a land mine explosion injured Thai soldiers, has killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000 people. Both countries have recalled their ambassadors, and Thailand has closed border crossings with Cambodia. The meeting Monday follows direct pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has warned the United States may not proceed with trade deals with either country if hostilities continue. Before departing for Kuala Lumpur, Thailand's acting prime minister said the key focus would be on an immediate ceasefire, but noted trust could be an issue.",

During Monday's talks, Starmer plans to urge Trump to press Israel to allow more aid into Gaza amid an increasingly desperate humanitarian crisis there. He'll also push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. Trump has been more focused on the U.S. getting credit for arragning food aid to Gaza. Starmer is further aiming to promote peace efforts in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine. Trade issues are likely to be a common ground. Despite ongoing challenges, Starmer's efforts to maintain a positive relationship with Trump seem to be working.",

In one week, Stanislav Tarnavskyi proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a puppy. Tarnavskyi spent three years in Russian captivity, enduring trauma that still haunts him through nightmares and flashbacks. He credits his fianc\u00e9e and therapy for helping him heal, though recovery remains a challenge.

With fall football practice starting this week, players hoping for a judge's approval to play may be left waiting. Legal expert Sam Ehrlich says it's likely too late for athletes to file cases and get relief. Judges have provided inconsistent rulings, and the issue might end up in a higher court. Some athletes, like Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, have won their cases. Others remain in limbo.
