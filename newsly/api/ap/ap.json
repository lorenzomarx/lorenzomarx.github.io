      "description": "President Donald Trump says the United States will get magnets and rare earth minerals from China under a new trade deal and tariffs on Chinese goods will go to 55%. Trump said Wednesday in return the U.S. will allow Chinese students to attend American colleges and universities. An international rights group says several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains. The report by Global Rights Compliance was released Wednesday. It says the companies might be linked because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from China\u2019s far-western Xinjiang region. China's Foreign Ministry rejects the forced labor claims as lies.",

      "description": "Los Angeles police have swiftly enforced a downtown curfew, making arrests moments after it took effect, deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Hours later after the curfew went into effect Tuesday night, many of the protesters had dispersed, although small sporadic confrontations continued. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier accused Trump of drawing a \u201cmilitary dragnet\u201d across the nation\u2019s second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard. He also deployed Marines, though none were seen on the streets Tuesday. Trump ordered the deployment of nearly 5,000 troops, including National Guard and Marines, to LA.",

The ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said that women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry gave the updated figures on Wednesday. It\u2019s a grim milestone in the war that began with Hamas\u2019 attack on Oct. 7, 2023 into southern Israel. The war shows no sign of ending.
