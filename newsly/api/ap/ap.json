      "description": "A senior Ukrainian officials says an exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine from their more than three-year war is underway. The official said the swap was ongoing Friday morning and had not yet finished. He who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Moscow did not immediately confirm the exchange was underway. Ukraine and Russia agreed to the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side a week ago in Turkey in their first direct peace talks since the early weeks of Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of its neighbor. That meeting lasted only two hours and brought no breakthrough in international diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to put a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are manufactured in the United States. The threat delivered over social media could dramatically increase the price of iPhones, potentially hurting sales and the profits of one of America\u2019s leading technology companies. The company now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major companies as being in the White House\u2019s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by the import taxes being imposed by Trump.",

By one measure, the dinner marked the ascendance of an industry that has been eager to establish its influence. Once a crypto skeptic, Trump has become a big fan and a powerful player. However, even some pro-Trump crypto enthusiasts fear that the president\u2019s involvement is undermining their credibility. Trump\u2019s family business is profiting from the sale of the $TRUMP meme coin, raising concerns about how investors can buy access to the president.",

Chinese students accounted for 1,203 of Harvard's 6,703 international students in 2024.
