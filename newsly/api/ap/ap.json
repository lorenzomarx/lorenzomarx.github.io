      "description": "The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed the Justice Department for files in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation and is seeking depositions with the Clintons and former law enforcement officials. It's part of a congressional probe lawmakers believe may show links to President Donald Trump and former top officials. The Republican-controlled committee issued subpoenas for depositions with former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and eight former top law enforcement officials. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein\u2019s crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago. But lawmakers from both major political parties and many members of the Republican president\u2019s base have refused to let it go.",

      "description": "Truck drivers delivering aid in Gaza say their work has become increasingly dangerous. Since Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas in March, the situation has worsened. Hungry crowds often rip aid from moving trucks and armed gangs hijack them to sell the aid at high prices. Drivers have been killed in the chaos. Israel has made recent moves to allow more aid into Gaza. But drivers say it's still not enough and the situation remains extremely dangerous. Some drivers have quit due to the risks. The U.N. says flooding Gaza with aid could ease the desperation and improve drivers' safety.",

      "description": "Texas Democrats prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump. In California, the state's dominant Democrats are maneuvering to counter Trump's Texas play by boosting Democratic House seats in the liberal-leaning state. The rivalry tugging at the nation's political balance is playing out in advance of the 2026 midterm elections, with both parties angling to gain ground in Washington. The Texas map would shore up Republicans\u2019 midterm prospects as the president's political standing slumps. California Democrats are weighing political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state.",

The ministry didn\u2019t say what specific moves the Kremlin might take, but President Vladimir Putin has previously announced that Moscow was planning to deploy its new Oreshnik missiles on the territory of its neighbor and ally Belarus this year.",
