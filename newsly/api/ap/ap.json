The strikes were confirmed by the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which did not acknowledge any casualties. The airstrikes represent one of the highest death tolls so far in the campaign launched under President Donald Trump that has involved hundreds of strikes since March 15. Central Command said U.S. forces acted to eliminate fuel for the Houthis and deprive them of illegal revenue.",

Investigators say the son of a sheriff\u2019s deputy opened fire with his mother\u2019s former service weapon.

On the American side, billionaire real estate magnate Steve Witkoff leads the effort by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to restrict Tehran\u2019s atomic program, which they fear could allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon. Representing Iran is Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who like many of his generation is a veteran of the bloody Iran-Iraq war. He rose through the ranks of Iran\u2019s diplomatic corps and served as a trusted negotiator during talks that led to Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",

The split ruling from the liberal-controlled court on Friday affirms the partial veto power of Wisconsin governors. The veto has been used by both Republican and Democratic governors to reshape spending bills passed by the Legislature. Gov. Tony Evers took an increase for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years and vetoed the \u201c20\u201d and the hyphen to make the end date 2425. The justices said governors are allowed to strike digits or create a longer duration than what the Legislature approved.",
