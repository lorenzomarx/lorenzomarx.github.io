      "description": "The United States has attacked three sites in Iran, inserting itself into Israel\u2019s war aimed at destroying the country\u2019s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe that prompted fears of a wider regional conflict. Addressing the nation from the White House, President Donald Trump asserted that Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites were \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d There was no independent damage assessment. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran confirmed that attacks took place on its Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz sites, but it insisted that its nuclear program will not be stopped.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says the U.S. military struck three sites in Iran, inserting itself into Israel\u2019s effort to decapitate the country\u2019s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe amid Tehran\u2019s threat of reprisals that could spark a wider regional conflict. The decision to directly involve the U.S. comes after more than a week of strikes by Israel on Iran that have moved to systematically eradicate the country\u2019s air defenses and offensive missile capabilities, while damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. But U.S. and Israeli officials have said that American stealth bombers and a 30,000-lb. bunker buster bomb they alone can carry offered the best chance of destroying heavily-fortified sites connected to the Iranian nuclear program.",

      "description": "Former Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil has returned to the Northeast U.S. after spending 104 days in custody for protesting against Israel's war in Gaza. Greeting supporters at New Jersey's Newark International Airport on Saturday, Khalil pushed his infant son's stroller with one hand and pumped his fist in the air with the other. He told reporters he will continue to speak up for Palestine even if threatened with death. Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, wasn't accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. But the government has said noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled for what it deems antisemitic views.",

The white top and blue hull of the 56-meter Bayesian, covered with algae and mud, was visible clear of the sea in a holding area of a yellow floating crane barge. The Bayesian sank Aug. 19 during a violent storm as Lynch was treating friends to a cruise to celebrate his acquittal two months earlier in the U.S. on fraud charges.",
