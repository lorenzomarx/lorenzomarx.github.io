      "description": "Israel has identified the remains of Eliyahu Margalit, a 76-year-old hostage handed over by Hamas. Margalit was abducted on October 7, 2023, during Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s office said Saturday his family has been notified. This marks the 10th returned hostage body since a ceasefire began over a week ago. Hamas has handed over an 11th body, but it wasn't a hostage. The ceasefire agreement includes the return of all hostages\u2019 bodies, totaling 28. Meanwhile, aid into Gaza remains limited, with only 339 trucks offloaded since the ceasefire began, despite an agreement allowing 600 trucks daily. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire.",

      "description": "The federal government shutdown is approaching the second longest on record and there's no end in sight. Some lawmakers predict it could surpass the 35-day shutdown from President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The nation\u2019s 1.3 million active-duty service members have gotten a temporary reprieve. But hundreds of thousands of federal civilian employees are being furloughed and facing financial stress. The travel economy is taking a big hit with tourist sites such as Smithsonian museums in the nation's capital closed. There have been air controller shortages in some cities and flight delays. The longer the shutdown lasts, the more it could be a drag on the economy.",

Saturday's incident comes as Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been attacking ships through the Red Sea corridor. However, the rebels did not immediately claim the attack, though it can take them hours or even days to do so. The maritime security firm Ambrey described the ship as a tanker that was \u201cen route from Sohar, Oman, to Djibouti.\u201d It said radio traffic suggested the crew was preparing to abandon ship and a search-and-rescue effort was underway.",

In one of the hardest hit villages, Kipnuk, an initial assessment showed that 121 or homes \u2014 or 90% of the total \u2014 have been destroyed, Dunleavy wrote. In Kwigillingok, where three dozen homes floated away, slightly more than one-third of the residences are uninhabitable.",

      "description": "Hospitals and doctors' offices are inviting singers and musicians to help patients manage their pain, as music's ability to reduce pain is gaining attention. No one is suggesting that a catchy song can completely eliminate serious pain. But several recent studies have suggested that listening to music can either reduce the perception of pain or enhance a person\u2019s ability to tolerate it. The key is letting patients choose the music and encouraging active listening. Scientists say one aspect of music's power is simple distraction, but it's more than that. It changes the perception and experience of pain, and the isolation and anxiety.",

They swept the Milwaukee Brewers out of the NL Championship Series with a 5-1 victory featuring an iconic three-homer, 10-strikeout performance by Shohei Ohtani.
