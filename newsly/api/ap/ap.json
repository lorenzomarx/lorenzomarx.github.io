      "description": "State media says Iran executed three more prisoners Wednesday for alleged spying in the latest hangings connected to its war against Israel. The hangings happened in Urmia Prison in Iran\u2019s West Azerbaijan province, which is the country\u2019s most northwest province. IRNA cited Iran\u2019s judiciary for the news, saying the men had been accused of bringing \u201cassassination equipment\u201d into the country. Iran has carried out several hangings during its war with Israel, sparking fears from activists that it could conduct a wave of executions after the conflict ended.",

      "description": "Many Iranians are still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel and a sudden, U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Now, as they return to their neighborhoods deeply shaken by Israeli air assaults, fears mount over what the country\u2019s theocracy may do next. Human rights advocates have already warned that Iran\u2019s government is ramping up executions of dissidents and political prisoners. Four Iranians recounted to The Associated Press that they believe only a minority in the Islamic Republic still firmly supports its leadership. They said they are concerned the fallout from Israel\u2019s attack will derail any momentum for change in the country\u2019s clerical rule, in place since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is insisting that U.S. strikes delivered a crushing blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear program. That's despite a preliminary American intelligence assessment suggesting that the assault inflicted only a marginal setback.

The administration deployed a phalanx of top officials to defend Trump's claims that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said was assessment was \u201cpreliminary\u201d and \u201clow confidence.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the officials who disclosed the findings are \u201cprofessional stabbers.\u201d",
