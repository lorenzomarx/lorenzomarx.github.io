      "description": "Groups representing some of South Africa\u2019s white minority have responded to a plan by U.S. President Donald Trump to offer them refugee status and resettlement in the United States by saying: thanks, but no thanks. The plan was detailed in an executive order Trump signed Friday that stopped all aid and other financial assistance to South Africa as punishment for what his administration said were \u201crights violations\u201d against white South Africans. The South African government denies it. Two of the most prominent groups representing Afrikaners said Saturday they are here to stay, but thanked Trump for raising their issues.",

      "description": "False and misleading social media posts are circulating online as the Trump administration moves to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development. They raise questions about funding for certain projects and organizations, often claiming without evidence that the money was used inappropriately. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said to reporters on Tuesday, for example, that USAID had spent $70,000 for the production of a \u201cDEI musical\u201d in Ireland; $47,000 for a \u201ctransgender opera\u201d in Colombia, $32,000 for a \u201ctransgender comic book\u201d in Peru. USAID did not fund those programs. They were awarded by the Department of State's Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.",

      "description": "Forced leaves have begun in Washington and worldwide for most employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Under a Trump administration plan, the agency is to be left with fewer than 300 workers out of many thousands. The leaves at USAID started Friday. Federal workers associations have turned to the courts to try to roll back orders dismantling most of the agency and U.S.- funded aid programs around the world. It's not clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what Trump administration says is a review of the aid and development programs it wants to resume.",

Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency was created to discover and eliminate what the Trump administration has deemed to be wasteful government spending.",

      "description": "Hamas-led militants have released three gaunt, frail-looking Israeli hostages and Israel freed 183 Palestinian prisoners in the fifth exchange of a ceasefire agreement that has paused the war in Gaza. The hostages\u2019 condition and scenes of Hamas forcing them to speak in the handover sparked outrage in Israel. It could increase pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend the ceasefire beyond its current six-week phase. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza does not appear to have affected the truce's current phase. But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult one.",

      "description": "The waters of Cape Cod Bay are coming for the big brown house perched on a sandy bluff high above the beach. It\u2019s just a matter of when. The luxury house near Wellfleet, Massachusetts, is expected to tumble into the bay sometime in the next three years as erosion gnaws away at the bluff. The owner removed parts of the house before stopping work. He\u2019s since sold the place to a salvage company, his attorney said, that says it won\u2019t pay to remove it. Town officials worry the home's collapse will damage delicate beds in their harbor where farmers grow the famed Wellfleet oyster. The home's certain fate is a reminder of the fragility of building along the cape, where thanks to climate change sea level rise has accelerated in recent years.",

They say making trains harder to climb and train surfers more easy to detect might need to be part of the solution. One subway driver says locking the doors at the ends of train cars might help prevent people from climbing onto the roof. Six people died surfing New York City subway trains last year, which was one more than in 2023. The NYPD reported that arrests of alleged subway surfers rose to 229 last year, up from 135 the year before. The youngest was 9 years old.",
