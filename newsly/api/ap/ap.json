      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed the planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that any peace deal excluding Kyiv would lead to \u201cdead solutions.\u201d The meeting, scheduled for Friday in Alaska, is seen as a potential breakthrough after weeks of expressing frustration that more was not being done to quell the fighting. In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, enshrined in the constitution, must be non-negotiable and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine\u2019s voice at the table.",

      "description": "International condemnation is growing over Israel\u2019s decision for a military takeover of Gaza City. And little appears to be changing immediately on the ground in the Palestinian territory shattered by 22 months of war. Health officials say 11 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead Saturday while 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours. Ceasefire efforts are reviving with Israel's announcement. Families of hostages rallied again to pressure the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid fears that the offensive will put the 50 remaining hostages at risk. Just 20 of them are thought to be alive.",

The streets were bustling with revelers, but there was no visible increase in law enforcement. Trump had announced a security lockdown starting at midnight, following a weekend assault on a government official. He has threatened to take federal control of the city, citing safety concerns. Mayor Muriel Bowser has not publicly responded. Trump's plans could include deploying the National Guard, but further actions may face legal challenges. The situation remains fluid as the city awaits further developments.",

Parliament in early July passed a law banning Palestine Action and making it a crime to publicly support the organization. That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest Britain\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza.

Their SpaceX capsule parachuted into the Pacific off the Southern California coast on Saturday, a day after departing the orbiting lab. Splashing down were two Americans, one Japanese and one Russian. They launched in March as the replacements for NASA\u2019s stuck astronauts. Boeing\u2019s botched Starliner demo kept the two test pilots at the space station for more than nine months instead of a week. This was SpaceX\u2019s third Pacific splashdown with people on board, but the first for a NASA crew in 50 years.",

Michelle Bowman pointed to July's hiring slowdown, along with her belief that inflation is heading down toward 2% despite President Donald Trump's tariffs. She was one of two Fed officials who voted a week and a half ago in favor of lowering interest rates. They lost out as nine other Fed officials voted to keep rates steady. Lower rates can help the economy but can also fuel inflation.",
