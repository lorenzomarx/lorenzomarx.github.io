      "description": "President Donald Trump has used his social media account to share a video about election conspiracy theories that includes a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle. The Republican president's Thursday night post also amplified his false claims that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent. Trump's post has drawn bipartisan backlash for its treatment of the nation\u2019s first Black president and first lady, who are Democrats. Black Republican Sen. Tim Scott is among those criticizing the post as racist. The White House is pushing back against criticism of the post. An Obama spokeswoman says the former president has no response.",

      "description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi says a key participant in the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans is in custody. Bondi says the man landed Friday morning at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. The attack killed Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens and immediately emerged as a divisive political issue. Republicans challenged President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on security at the facility, the military response to the violence and the Democratic administration\u2019s changing narrative about who was responsible. A Libyan militant suspected of being a mastermind of the attacks was convicted in the U.S. and is serving a prison sentence.",

      "description": "Iran and the United States are poised Friday to hold negotiations in Oman at least over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. The talks follow a chaotic week that initially saw plans for regional countries to take part in talks in Turkey. Previous rounds of meetings turned to ash following Israel\u2019s launch of a 12-day war against Iran back in June. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war. Meanwhile, nationwide protests have shaken Iran's theocracy. It responded with a bloody crackdown that killed thousands and reportedly saw tens of thousands arrested. President Donald Trump has threatened to strike the country in the time since, spurring the talks.",

The Olympics are returning to Italy on Friday, 20 years after the country last hosted them in Turin. This is the most spread-out Olympics in history, with competition venues dotting an area of about a space roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey. The main hub Friday is in Milan at San Siro soccer stadium. There are three other places where athletes will be marching, some carrying their country\u2019s flag: Cortina in the heart of the Dolomite mountains; Livigno in the Alps; Predazzo in the autonomous province of Trento.",

It reports just over 3.6 million births, about 24,000 fewer than in 2024. This decline aligns with expert predictions that the 2024 increase wouldn't start an upward trend. The CDC updated its data last week, covering nearly all of the babies born in 2025. Final numbers may add only a few thousand more. Despite efforts to encourage births, like expanding in vitro fertilization access, the fertility rate has been declining. Economic conditions and uncertainty continue to impact childbearing decisions.",
