A list of products worth $200 billion Canadian dollars would send a message to U.S. exporters about the harm tariffs would cause them, Freeland said Monday in a statement. \u201cOur counterpunch must be dollar-for-dollar \u2014 and it must be precisely and painfully targeted: Florida orange growers, Wisconsin dairy farmers, Michigan dishwasher manufacturers, and much more.\u201d",

He jumpstarted the effort hours after taking office, ordering the name of North America\u2019s tallest peak to be changed from Denali back to Mount McKinley in honor of the nation's 25th president, William McKinley. In the same executive order, he has called on the U.S. Interior Department to work with Alaska Natives and others to adopt names for other landmarks that would honor their history and culture. Some of this work will involve the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The little known panel of federal experts has been around for nearly 135 years.",

Monday's ceremony is widely being treated as the last major observance that any notable number of survivors will be able to attend. Nazi German forces murdered some 1.1 million people at the site in southern Poland, which was under German occupation during World War II. Most of the victims were Jews killed on an industrial scale in gas chambers, but the Germans also murdered many Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, gay people and others who were targeted for elimination in the Nazi racial ideology.",

The abrupt action targeting career prosecutors who worked on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team is the latest sign of upheaval inside the Justice Department. It reflects the administration\u2019s determination to purge the government of workers it perceives as disloyal to the president. The move, which follows the reassignment of multiple senior career officials across divisions, was made even though rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain in their positions across presidential administrations and are not punished because of their involvement in sensitive investigations.",
