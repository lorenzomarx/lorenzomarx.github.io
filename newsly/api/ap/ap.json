      "description": "Protesters in Israel have torched tires and blocked highways to demand a ceasefire to free hostages in Gaza. This comes as Israeli leaders push for an offensive against Hamas. The protest Tuesday follows deadly strikes on Gaza's main hospital that killed 20 people, including medics and journalists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected meet his cabinet later on Tuesday. Relatives of hostages hope steady pressure can push the government to commit to ceasefire talks. But far-right coalition members have threatened to bolt if Israel agrees to a truce. Most hostages taken on October 7, 2023, have been released, but 50 remain in captivity in Gaza.",

      "description": "A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration\u2019s lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order by the chief judge that stopped the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen on Tuesday granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise would \"offend the rule of law.\u201d Cullen was nominated by President Donald Trump and serves in Virginia but was tapped to oversee the case because all of Maryland\u2019s federal judges were named as defendants. The unusual circumstance reflects the Republican administration\u2019s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies. The White House has no immediate comment.",

      "description": "Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the U.S. this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods. A widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 or less is set to end starting on Friday. Trump already ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d rule for inexpensive items sent from China and Hong Kong, but having to pay import taxes on small parcels from everywhere else likely will be a big change for some small businesses and online shoppers. Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs will be subject to the origin country\u2019s tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%.",

They question the lack of parliamentary approval and suggest it eases political pressure on President Yoweri Museveni. Ugandan officials have shared few details, but have said they prefer deportees of African origin without criminal records. Still, U.S. officials say they are processing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national charged with human smuggling, for deportation to Uganda. Critics argue the agreement benefits Museveni politically and economically. The deal comes amid U.S. sanctions on Ugandan officials over corruption and rights abuses. The lack of transparency and parliamentary oversight has raised concerns.",

His comments are seen as a threat against the European Union's digital rules targeting companies like Google and Apple. On Truth Social, Trump criticized digital taxes and regulations as discriminatory. He also complained about Chinese tech companies getting a pass from these rules. The EU's executive Commission defended its right to regulate economic activities.

The Nasdaq composite shed 0.2%. Apart from rattling financial markets, Trump's latest move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court.

Most of the scientists who responded to questions from The Associated Press said the reports misuse or misinterpret their work.
