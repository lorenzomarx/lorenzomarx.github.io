      "description": "President Donald Trump's comments that the U.S. should take long-term control of war-shattered Gaza and that the area's residents should be permanently resettled have been contradicted by top people in his administration. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the area\u2019s residents would only be relocated on an interim basis as the U.S. rebuilds Gaza. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says U.S. taxpayers won\u2019t finance rebuilding Gaza and insisted that Trump had \u201cmade it clear\u201d that the people of Gaza would be moved out of the area only temporarily.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat and his main spokesperson are walking back the idea that he wants the permanent relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, after American allies and even Republican lawmakers rebuffed his suggestion that the U.S. take \u201cownership\u201d of the territory. Trump had called for \u201cpermanently\u201d resettling Palestinians from war-torn Gaza and left open the door to deploying American troops there as part of a massive rebuilding operation. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday he only sought to move roughly 1.8 million Gazans temporarily to allow for reconstruction. Even that proposal has drawn criticism from Palestinians and Arab nations that Trump has called on to take them in.",

Many saw the comments as an effort to erase them from their homeland, a continuation of the \u201cNakba,\u201d or \u201cCatastrophe,\" their name for the expulsion and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from what is now Israel during the 1948 war. Palestinians displaced during the Israel-Hamas war have shown a powerful determination to return to their homes, with hundreds of thousands during the current ceasefire flooding back to neighborhoods devastated by Israeli bombardment and offensives.",

Trump said Tuesday that he wanted to remove Palestinians from Gaza and impose a U.S. takeover in the region. But some leaders in the nation's largest Arab American community in Dearborn, Michigan, treaded cautiously on Wednesday. Imad Hamad, executive director of the Dearborn-based American Human Rights Council, said it was \u201ctoo early to render a judgement.\u201d Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate in over two decades to win Dearborn. His top diplomat and main spokesperson on Wednesday walked back the idea that he wants to permanently relocate Palestinians from Gaza.",

Masked and armed National Guard members picked through brush running along the border barrier on the outskirts of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, pulling out makeshift ladders and ropes tucked away in the trenches.. It comes after a turbulent week along the border after Trump announced he would delay imposing crippling tariffs on Mexico for at least a month. In exchange, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised she would send the country\u2019s National Guard to reinforce the border.",

The surprising January 2025 heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. That's a claim that is dividing the research community. January 2025 globally was warmer than January 2024. And it was 1.75 degrees Celsius, or 3.15 degrees Fahrenheit, warmer than it was before industrial times.",
