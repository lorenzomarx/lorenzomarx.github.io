      "description": "President Donald Trump is urging Iran to make a nuclear deal now that Israel has launched strikes against the country. Trump says on social media Iran should make a deal \u201cbefore there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.\u201d Trump is holding onto hope the long-simmering dispute over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program can be resolved. But with the Israeli military operation now underway and likely to continue for some time, Trump will be tested anew on his ability to deliver on a campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts. The Republican president is already struggling to find an endgame to the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.",

Noem spoke Thursday, hours before a judge directed the president to return control to California over National Guard troops he deployed after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals quickly put the brakes on that and temporarily blocked the judge's order, which was to go into effect on Friday. The judge\u2019s order said the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded President Donald Trump\u2019s statutory authority.",
