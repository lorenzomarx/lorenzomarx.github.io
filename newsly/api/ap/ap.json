      "description": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States. Starmer says the plan emerged after talks among the four countries\u2019 leaders following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Oval Office blowout with U.S. President Donald Trump. The prime minister told the BBC he believes the U.S. president wants a durable peace in Ukraine. He repeated his assertion that American security guarantees will be needed to make it stick. Starmer is hosting a summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss Ukraine.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s senior aides and allies are lashing out at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Their criticism from Washington came as he attended a European summit Sunday in London to rally international support for his military\u2019s fight against the Russian invasion. Following Trump\u2019s lead, White House officials and Republicans in Congress are demanding that Zelenskyy display more gratitude for U.S. support and an openness to potential war-ending concessions to Russia. Some suggested Zelenskyy should consider resigning. But they offered little clarity as to what Zelenskyy and Ukraine could do after Friday\u2019s Oval Office meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated him.",

      "description": "The first time Donald Trump spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he tried to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. The 2019 phone call eventually led to Trump's impeachment. On Friday, a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office turned heated. Vice President JD Vance told Zelenskyy to show more gratitude toward Trump before the president himself began shouting at and berating the Ukrainian leader. The blowup cast fresh doubt on prospects for U.S. support of Kyiv in fending off Russia\u2019s invasion.",

But a blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to sign a deal Friday that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Instead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance further splintered American political support for Ukraine. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has backed Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster.\"",

      "description": "Earth's warming climate is causing problems for big coffee producers everywhere and some are looking to a rarely cultivated species that may stand up better to drought and heat. It's excelsa, which is native to South Sudan and a handful of other African countries. The tree\u2019s deep roots, thick leaves and big trunk help it thrive in extreme conditions where other coffees cannot. It\u2019s also resistant to many common coffee pests and diseases. Excelsa currently has less than 1% of a market dominated by arabica and robusta. In South Sudan, some farmers testing the excelsa trees hope it will help lift them out of poverty.",
