      "description": "President Donald Trump's order imposing new tariffs on 68 countries and the European Union starting in seven days has injected a new dose of uncertainty in an already uncertain process. Trump has promised these tariffs will boost the U.S. economy and create jobs, but critics warn they could harm America's global standing and increase inflation. The legality of the tariffs is being questioned in court, with judges expressing skepticism. Major companies have warned of financial impacts, and there are concerns about rising inflation and job losses in manufacturing.",

      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have drawn expressions of relief from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others have expressed frustration over running out of time for talks. The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7. Trump announced them after hitting his Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America's trading partners. Financial markets fell Friday, with South Korea's Kospi dropping 3.4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen.",

The order Thursday by U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco affects 7,000 Nepalese whose Temporary Protected Status designations were scheduled to expire Tuesday. About 51,000 people from Honduras and nearly 3,000 from Nicaragua were scheduled to have their status terminated in September. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ended the program after determining that conditions in their home countries no longer warranted protections. The National TPS Alliance is challenging the terminations as arbitrary and racist.",

Lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas party had made the proposal Thursday night in the Legislative Assembly. The changes also eliminate the second round of presidential voting. Bukele won reelection last year despite a constitutional ban, after a 2021 Supreme Court ruling allowed a second five-year term. Figueroa argued that other officials can seek unlimited reelection. Bukele is popular for his tough stance on street gangs, despite controversies over his administration's methods.",
