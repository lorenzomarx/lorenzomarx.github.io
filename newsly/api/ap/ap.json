      "description": "The Trump administration wants the Supreme Court to permit the firing of the head of the federal agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers. That's according to documents obtained Sunday that would mark the first appeal to the justices since President Donald Trump took office. The emergency appeal is the start of what probably will be a steady stream seeking to undo lower court rulings that have slowed his second term agenda. The Justice Department\u2019s filing obtained by The Associated Press asks the conservative-majority court to lift a judge\u2019s order temporarily reinstating Hampton Dellinger as the leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",

      "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to slash the size of the federal workforce reached the Food and Drug Administration this weekend. Three FDA staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the layoffs publicly say probationary employees received notices Saturday evening that they were being let go. The jobs were across the FDA, including reviewing the safety of food ingredients, medical devices and tobacco products like electronic cigarettes. The total number of positions eliminated was not clear Sunday. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would fire 5,200 probationary employees across its agencies.",

The moves have generated great upheaval and tested the department's independence. Recent firings and resignations have rattled the foundations of an institution that's prided itself on being driven solely by facts, evidence and the law. A retired federal prosecutor says some of the decisions have all the signs \u201cof corrupting the criminal justice system.\"",

In the early going, he's empowered Elon Musk to help force the firing of thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies. The new president has imposed tariffs, wiped out diversity programs and rolled back transgender rights. His administration has begun an immigration crackdown that's been overshadowed by so many other steps. At the same time, the economy is beginning to soften, judges are having their say and even some Republicans in Congress are starting to grumble.",

Water has submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides have blocked roads in Virginia. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service has warned residents to stay off the roads. Forecasters also have predicted weekend snowstorms in the Northeast and the threat of tornadoes for the Mississippi Valley. Heavy snow is expected to blanket much of New England. Meteorologists are also warning the U.S. could get its coldest polar vortex stretching event this season in the northern Rockies and northern Plains.",

Frustrations over the flow of aid has led some North Carolinians to express support for the agency's elimination. But some experts and officials warn that disbanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency could mean a slower recovery process and strain local resources. Experts also say there may be some misconceptions about the role that FEMA is supposed to play in disaster response.",

That's according to a U.S. official who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the upcoming diplomatic efforts and spoke on condition of anonymity. It's unclear whether Ukraine or European officials will be represented in upcoming discussions. Who ultimately ends up at the table could change.",

And as a top U.S. envoy revealed that he and a fellow negotiator appointed by President Donald Trump were heading there. Trump earlier this week jettisoned three years of U.S. policy and announced he would likely meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a deal to end almost three years of fighting.",
