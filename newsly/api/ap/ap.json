      "description": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the U.S. will begin revoking the visas of Chinese students, \u201cincluding those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\u201d His announcement on X added to the uncertainty for America\u2019s international students, who have faced intensifying scrutiny from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. In a cable sent Tuesday to U.S. embassies and consulates, Rubio halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for international students until the department releases guidelines for increased vetting of their activity on social media. Existing appointments may be kept and will proceed under current review guidelines, the cable said, but new guidance is expected in the coming days.",

      "description": "A federal trade court is blocking President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. The ruling from a three-judge panel came after several lawsuits arguing Trump has exceeded his authority, left U.S. trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos. At least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s trade policy. Trump has says he has the power to act because the country\u2019s trade deficits amount to a national emergency. The court found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the use of tariffs.",

The celebrity couple are best known for the TV series \u201cChrisley Knows Best.\u201d Trump pardoned them Wednesday, paving the way for their release from separate prison facilities in Pensacola, Florida, and Lexington, Kentucky. Federal prosecutors said at the couple's 2022 trial that the Chrisleys conspired to defraud Atlanta area banks of $30 million and tried to hide their earnings from tax authorities. Trump\u2019s decision to pardon them is another example of the president\u2019s willingness to pardon high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.",

Human Rights Office for the Palestinian territories, said it appeared that Israeli army fire had caused most of the injuries. On Tuesday, crowds of Palestinians overwhelmed a new aid distribution hub set up by an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation. The crowd broke through fences and an Associated Press journalist heard Israeli tank and gun fire, and saw a military helicopter firing flares. The distribution hub outside Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah was opened the day before by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been slated by Israel to take over aid operations.",

There was no confirmation from Hamas. Sinwar is the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who helped mastermind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that started the Israel-Hamas war. He was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024. Israeli strikes have decimated Hamas\u2019 Gaza leadership during the 19-month war. But the militant group has maintained its rule over the parts of Gaza not seized by Israel and still holds dozens of hostages.",

This was the first such request at Combs\u2019 trial, which is in its third week of testimony in Manhattan. A defense lawyer said Wednesday that prosecutors posed questions to a Los Angeles Fire Department investigator which could imply to the jury that Combs interfered in the probe of another rapper's firebombed luxury car. After a break, the judge instructed the jury to disregard questions related to destroyed fingerprint cards. Combs has pleaded not guilty to leading a racketeering conspiracy that relied on fear and violence to get what he wanted.",
