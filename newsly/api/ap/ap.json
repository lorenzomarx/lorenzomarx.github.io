      "description": "Pope Francis\u2019 body will be moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to lie in state allowing the Catholic faithful to pay their respects to the Argentine pope. Francis is being remembered for his humble style, concern for the poor and insistent prayers for peace. Heads of state are expected for the funeral Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square. But the three days of public viewing are largely for ordinary Catholics to mourn the 88-year-old pope. Francis died Monday after suffering a stroke. His body will be transferred Wednesday morning to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The public mourning period will end on Friday night.",

      "description": "Pope Francis had a learning curve on clergy sexual abuse, with the turning point coming in 2018. Few people could have predicted that a comment he made then, dismissing victims of Chile's most notorious pedophile, would blow up into the biggest crisis of his papacy. But it was one that eventually set the Catholic Church on a new path of accountability for clergy sexual abuse. Years later, Francis recognized that the Chile trip was his \u201cconversion\u201d moment, when he came to realize he had been misled about just how bad the problem was.",

An Israeli strike on the Gaza Strip overnight into Wednesday killed 23 people, according to local health authorities. Egypt and Qatar are still developing the proposal, which would include the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the entire strip and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas would also hand over power to a committee of independent technocrats. Israel and the United States have ruled out any proposal that would allow Hamas to retain influence in Gaza and rearm.",

Israel has restricted the supply of humanitarian aid throughout much of the war and imposed a complete blockade more than six weeks ago. Its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory have challenged patients' ability to reach regular care. Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war. That's according to the World Health Organization earlier this year. Patients who should be having three weekly dialysis visits are now getting two and for shorter periods.",

As investigators began probing the attack, many shops and businesses in Kashmir closed to protest the killings following a call from the region\u2019s religious and political parties. Tens of thousands of armed police and soldiers fanned out across the region and erected additional checkpoints. Police called it a \u201cterror attack\u201d and blamed militants fighting against Indian rule. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.",

Tuesday\u2019s attack took place in the picturesque town of Pahalgam in the Himalayan mountains, popular with Indian visitors. Police accused rebels of masterminding the attack. The region has seen a spate of militant attacks in remote mountains in recent years, but violence has largely declined in the Kashmir Valley. India and Pakistan have each laid claim to Kashmir since war broke out following the British partition of the subcontinent in 1947.",

But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. President Donald Trump placed a 145% import tax on China, which countered with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures.",

The incursion into the IRS' typically apolitical stance threatens to further erode trust in federal institutions and weaponize enforcement efforts.
