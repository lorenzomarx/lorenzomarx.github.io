      "description": "The Trump Justice Department says it has fired more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal investigations into President Donald Trump. The abrupt action targeting career prosecutors who worked on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team is the latest sign of upheaval inside the Justice Department. It reflects the administration\u2019s determination to purge the government of workers it perceives as disloyal to the president. The move, which follows the reassignment of multiple senior career officials across divisions, was made even though rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain in their positions across presidential administrations and are not punished because of their involvement in sensitive investigations.",

The world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, is overseeing a new Department of Government Efficiency. Billionaires or mega-millionaires are lined up to run the treasury, commerce, interior and education departments, NASA and the Small Business Administration, and fill key foreign posts. Trump's supporters say it makes sense to hire people who have had great success in the private sector. Others raise concerns about conflicts of interest at odds with Trump\u2019s pledge to fight for \u201cforgotten men and women.\u201d",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has signed 10 executive orders on immigration and issued a slew of edicts to carry out promises of mass deportations and border security. Some actions were felt immediately. Others are being challenged in court. Some may take years to happen, if ever. Much of what Trump can do boils down how much money he gets from Congress or by invoking emergency powers, as he did in his first term. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it made an average of 593 immigration arrests daily from Thursday through Sunday. If that rate holds, it would be the highest since the Obama administration, when daily arrests averaged 636 in 2013.",

Allies including Ukraine also are struggling to save part of their security funding from the 90-day freeze. President Donald Trump ordered the funding stop last week. The administration plans to use the time to decide which of the thousands of humanitarian, development and security programs will keep getting money from the United States. Meantime, they were told to stop spending immediately. Only emergency food programs and military aid to allies Israel and Egypt were exempt.",

A dozen officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement gathered before dawn Monday in a Maryland parking lot, then fanned out to the Washington suburbs to find their targets: someone wanted in El Salvador for homicide, a person convicted of armed robbery in Maryland, a migrant found guilty of possessing child sexual abuse material and another with drug and gun convictions. All were in the country illegally. The Associated Press accompanied the officers, who offered a glimpse of how their work has changed.",

It\u2019s unclear how often the 27-year-old Leavitt plans to hold briefings. President Donald Trump had four press secretaries during his first administration, and the third never held a briefing during nine months on the job. The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room was the site of clashes between spokespeople and journalists during Trump\u2019s first term. The Republican also made appearances there. Previously, the youngest press secretary was Ronald Ziegler, who was 29 when he took the position in 1969 in Richard Nixon\u2019s administration.",

One directs Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revise the Pentagon\u2019s policy on transgender troops, likely setting in motion a future ban on their military service. Other orders would roll back diversity programs, create a space-based missile defense system and reinstate troops booted for refusing COVID-19 vaccines. The orders come just after Hegseth began his first day on the job Monday. A transgender ban had been widely expected, and lawyers for transgender troops have already pledged to fight it.",

The 15-month war, which has killed more than 47,000 people and displaced most of the population of 2.3 million, left a health system in shambles and large swaths of the territory reduced to rubble. A shortage of clean water and damaged sewer systems have spurred worries over the spread of infectious disease. Now aid groups are rushing to provide food and supplies amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas while planning the best way forward.",

Meanwhile, Israel says eight of the hostages to be freed in the weeks ahead are dead. A fragile ceasefire has entered a second week. The return of Palestinians is a dramatic reversal of the mass exodus that many had feared Israel would make permanent. Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and former schools are eager to return to their homes, even if they are likely destroyed.",
