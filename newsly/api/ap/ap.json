      "description": "The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline. Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they've run into a series of setbacks. Senators are expected to take a procedural vote Saturday to begin debate on the bill, but the timing is uncertain and there's a long path ahead after that. Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for more votes before it could reach the White House.",

      "description": "At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it\u2019s up to the Republican-controlled Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump\u2019s signature\u2019s domestic policy package will become law. Senators are working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it. The bill would make permanent many of the tax breaks passed in Trump's first term while adding new ones.",

      "description": "Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed at least 34 people, according to health officials. The attacks, which began late Friday and continued into Saturday, hit shelters and residential areas across Gaza, worsening its humanitarian crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested a ceasefire deal could happen within a week. Talks remain uncertain, however, as Israel demands Hamas disarm while Hamas insists on ending the war in exchange for freeing hostages. Meanwhile, Palestinians face severe food shortages, as Israeli is only letting a trickle of aid into the strip.",

Roberts said the danger is that people might pick up on such criticism. He cited \u201cserious threats of violence and murder of judges just simply for doing their work.\u201d",

      "description": "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America. Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Vaccine hesitancy grew as memories of these diseases faded. But some Americans know the reality of vaccine-preventable diseases all too well. Their lives were forever changed by rubella, measles, polio and whooping cough, and they clearly see the value of vaccines. Now, as preventable diseases begin to make a comeback, they long to spare others from similar pain.",
