      "description": "Many Iranians are still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel and a sudden, U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Now, as they return to their neighborhoods deeply shaken by Israeli air assaults, fears mount over what the country\u2019s theocracy may do next. Human rights advocates have already warned that Iran\u2019s government is ramping up executions of dissidents and political prisoners. Four Iranians recounted to The Associated Press that they believe only a minority in the Islamic Republic still firmly supports its leadership. They said they are concerned the fallout from Israel\u2019s attack will derail any momentum for change in the country\u2019s clerical rule, in place since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

      "description": "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the country is ending support for the vaccine alliance Gavi. Speaking at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, Kennedy criticized the organization for \u201cignoring science\u201d and losing public trust. He expressed concerns about Gavi's collaboration with the World Health Organization during the COVID-19 pandemic, accusing them of stifling free speech. Kennedy also questioned Gavi\u2019s vaccine recommendations, including immunizing pregnant women and funding vaccines in poorer countries. Gavi defended its decisions, citing WHO guidance and the role of vaccines in reducing childhood mortality. The U.S. has contributed $8 billion to Gavi since 2001.",
