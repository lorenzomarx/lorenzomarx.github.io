      "description": "The Rev. Jesse Jackson kept up his more than half-century-long fight for civil and human rights through his final years despite challenges over his health, the coronavirus pandemic, racial injustice and political divisions. Whether appearing at the funerals of Black people killed by police or participating in COVID-19 vaccination drives to address hesitancy in communities of color, Jackson built on a life in public advocacy that included running for president, international diplomacy and influencing the lexicon of racial identity in America. Jackson, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., died on Tuesday. He was 84.",

Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said Monday that the shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. Goncalves says investigators think the shooting at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket on Monday afternoon was targeted and may have involved a family dispute. Video online shows players and fans scrambling for cover and rushing to exits. Gov. Dan McKee says the state is grieving again after another recent mass shooting.",

For Republican lawmakers, who have largely supported the Trump administration\u2019s methods in the state, their priority is curbing the massive fraud that has plagued taxpayer funded programs. President Donald Trump has cited such fraud as justification for sending thousands of federal immigration officers into the state. While the immigration enforcement surge is winding down, the aftermath will reverberate at the state Capitol.",

The session, planned for Tuesday, comes after a first round of indirect talks held in Oman earlier in the month. They are being held as the U.S. ramps up its military presence in the region amid threats by President Donald Trump to use force to push a deal. Iran also began major Revolutionary Guard naval drills near key oil shipping routes. Still, both sides are signaling they are willing to reach a deal, which Iran says must include easing U.S.-led sanctions.",

The concern about the interview, which the late-night host referenced in his show and later posted in full online, stems from a requirement that broadcast stations give equal time to political candidates when they appear on-air. Although there are multiple exemptions to the provision, the Trump administration through the Federal Communications Commission has been moving to clamp down specifically on programs like Colbert\u2019s, which the agency has suggested may be \u201cmotivated by partisan purposes.\u201d",
