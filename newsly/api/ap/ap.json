      "description": "Authorities say a man who wounded 12 people in an attack on a group holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza had planned to kill them all but appeared to have second thoughts. They say Mohamed Sabry Soliman had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday\u2019s attack in which he yelled \u201cFree Palestine. The two incendiary devices he did throw into the group of about 20 people were enough to wound more than half of them, and authorities say he expressed no regrets about the attack. Federal and state prosecutors have filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively.",

The war has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations, as well as tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides.",

      "description": "Palestinian health officials and witnesses say Israeli forces fired on people as they headed toward an aid distribution site Tuesday, killing at least 27, in the third such incident in three days. The army said it fired \u201cnear a few individual suspects\u201d who left the designated route, approached its forces and ignored warning shots. The near-daily shootings have come after an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation established aid distribution points inside Israeli military zones, a system it says is designed to circumvent Hamas. The United Nations has rejected the new system, saying it doesn\u2019t address Gaza\u2019s mounting hunger crisis and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of casualties on Tuesday.",

And he\u2019s pushing the slow-rolling Senate to make it happen sooner rather than later. Trump met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune at the White House early this week and has been dialing senators for one-on-one chats, using both the carrot and stick to encourage them to act. But it\u2019s still a long road ahead for the 1,000-page-plus package. Senators want to make changes to protect Medicaid and to make sure some tax breaks become permanent.",

Baraka was denied entry to Delaney Hall and arrested on May 9. He was trying to join three Democratic members of Congress who went to conduct oversight. His trespassing charge was later dropped. Baraka is a candidate in a crowded field for the Democratic nomination for governor in the June 10 primary election. The lawsuit against interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba was filed Tuesday, the day early in-person voting began.",

Three-quarters of U.S. infants consume formula in the first six months of life. About 40% receive it as their only source of nutrition.

McDonald\u2019s introduced Snack Wraps in 2006 but pulled them in the U.S. a decade later because they were too complicated for its kitchens to prepare. But fans have clamored for a comeback for years. The U.S. president of McDonald says some customers kept ordering the Snack Wrap at drive-thrus. In the meantime, rivals like Burger King introduced their own chicken wraps. McDonald's expects Snack Wraps to boost its U.S. sales, which have been sluggish as consumers react to economic conditions.",
