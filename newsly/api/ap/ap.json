      "description": "Israeli airstrikes have hit Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, just days after the Iran-backed rebels fired cluster munitions toward Israel. That's according to the rebel-run media office and a local television station, which reported the strikes on Sunday. The attack was the first to hit the rebel-held Sanaa since a week ago, when Israel said targeted energy infrastructure it believed was used by the rebels. Israel has not confirmed Sunday\u2019s attack. The Houthis have launched missiles and drones toward Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea for more than 22 months. They say they are carrying out the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the war in the Gaza Strip.",

      "description": "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Canada are learning to live with great white sharks. Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted. Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. Researchers who track white sharks say the big fish are being sighted in northern waters more often and also appear to be spending more time there.",
