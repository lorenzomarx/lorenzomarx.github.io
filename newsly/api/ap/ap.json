      "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is calling for a special election on November 4 to introduce new U.S. House maps. The goal is to win more Democratic seats. This move responds to Republican efforts to gain five seats in Texas. On Thursday, Newsom released a campaign ad on social media as Democrats kicked off a press conference. State lawmakers need to declare the special election, and they plan to do so next week. Democrats have not yet released their draft maps, but they aim to pick up five more seats. The maps need voter approval because an independent commission currently draws them.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims there is no hunger in Gaza, but malnourished children are regularly arriving at Nasser Hospital. The U.N. says starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began. The Gaza Health Ministry says 171 people have died of malnutrition-related causes since July 1, a quarter of them children. Aid has increased in recent weeks, but food remains scarce or unaffordable for many. While the influx of food might help much of Gaza\u2019s population, experts say that is not necessarily the case for children who are already severely malnourished. They often require treatment first at a hospital, where vital micronutrients must be replenished before their bodies will be able to properly metabolize food.",
