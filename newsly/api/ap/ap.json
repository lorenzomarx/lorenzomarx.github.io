      "description": "A federal judge says the Trump administration has kept withholding foreign aid despite a court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide. But the U.S. District Judge declined Thursday to find Trump administration officials in contempt of his order. The ruling comes in a lawsuit by the nonprofit groups challenging the Trump administration\u2019s month-old cutoff of foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development and State Department, which shut down $60 billion in annual aid and development programs overseas almost overnight. Administration officials have defended the nonpayment, saying they could lawfully stop or terminate payments under thousands of contracts without violating the judge\u2019s order.",

He showed openness to auditing the Federal Reserve and accused Democrats of \u201ctreason.\u201d The Tesla CEO has become President Donald Trump\u2019s close adviser. He spoke Thursday about his crusade to cut government spending and downsize the federal workforce with the administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. Before speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, he met with Argentine President Javier Milei, who has been frequently praised by Musk. Milei popularized the power tool while campaigning in 2023 and proposing slashing public spending.",

President Donald Trump, one month into his second term, has publicly returned to one of his longtime talking points: a federal takeover of the District of Columbia. It would take some doing, though \u2014 including, literally, an act of Congress. It's the latest in the blizzard of initiatives that have surfaced since Trump took office Jan. 20. Whether it was just a reminder that the president possesses the power to set off alarms with an off-the-cuff remark or will direct his administration to try and make it happen remains to be seen.",

If Musk\u2019s target of $2 trillion in spending cuts is achieved by next year, supporters of the idea say that about one-fifth of those funds could be distributed to taxpaying households in checks of about $5,000. But before you start planning for a windfall, budget experts say such huge savings \u2014 nearly one-third of the federal government\u2019s annual spending \u2014 are highly unlikely.",

Standing up for children with disabilities has been a primary role of the department, which enforces the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Historically, most complaints to the department have involved disability discrimination. The freeze on pending cases and Trump\u2019s calls to dismantle the department altogether left many parents worrying about the federal government\u2019s commitment to disabled students. After The Associated Press asked the Education Department for comment on this reporting, a spokesperson said the department ended the pause on reviews of disability complaints Thursday.",

The 43-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and recently retired U.S. transportation secretary has yet to decide if that\u2019s a responsibility he wants. Buttigieg must decide soon whether he wants to return to the national spotlight as a candidate in Michigan\u2019s 2026 Senate race or focus on a much more consequential role as his party\u2019s next presidential nominee two years later.

The military said later the remains of Ariel and Kfir Bibas had been identified and the family notified. But the military said the additional body was not that of their mother Shiri Bibas nor any other hostage. It called the failure to return four hostages Thursday a violation of the utmost severity of the ceasefire agreement.",
