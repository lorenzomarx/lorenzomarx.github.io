      "description": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in London. The visit Thursday follows Zelenskyy's virtual meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders a day earlier. Trump assured the leaders he would prioritize a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, called the discussions constructive. However, some Ukrainians remain skeptical about achieving meaningful progress. Meanwhile, Russian strikes in Ukraine's Sumy and Kherson regions have injured several people, including children.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting in Alaska with Vladimir Putin could be a decisive moment in the war in Ukraine and in the U.S. leader\u2019s anomalous relationship with his Russian counterpart. Trump has long boasted that he\u2019s always gotten along well with Putin and spoken admiringly of him, even praising him as \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine. But in recent months, he\u2019s expressed open frustrations with Putin and called him \u201cCRAZY\u201d while threatening to impose sanctions on Russia. Still, Trump\u2019s self-imposed deadline for sanctions came and went without any announced penalties or explanation from the White House and the Republican president, tempering expectations for their Friday summit.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister has announced a contentious new settlement construction in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which Palestinians and rights groups worry will scuttle plans for a future Palestinian state by effectively cutting the West Bank into two separate parts. The announcement comes as many countries said they would recognize a Palestinian state in September. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said, \u201cThis reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize.\u201d",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims there is no hunger in Gaza, but malnourished children are regularly arriving at Nasser Hospital. The U.N. says starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began. The Gaza Health Ministry says 171 people have died of malnutrition-related causes since July 1, a quarter of them children. Aid has increased in recent weeks, but food remains scarce or unaffordable for many. While the influx of food might help much of Gaza\u2019s population, experts say that is not necessarily the case for children who are already severely malnourished. They often require treatment first at a hospital, where vital micronutrients must be replenished before their bodies will be able to properly metabolize food.",

Under a ramp-up of President Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of city police, a multiagency flood of federal law enforcement has become increasingly high profile in the nation\u2019s capital. National Guard troops and Humvees are guarding some Washington landmarks. Troops were also stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub.

It's the latest U.S. move against major Mexican drug operations. United Cartels is an umbrella organization made up of smaller cartels that have worked for different groups over time. The organization holds a fierce grip over the western state of Michoacan, Mexico.

Three out of every four stocks in the S&P 500 index dropped on Thursday, though gains for some influential Big Tech companies helped mask the losses. The index slipped 0.1% from its all-time high set the day before. The Dow dipped 79 points, while the Nasdaq composite was virtually unchanged. The hotter-than-expected inflation report forced traders to second guess the widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will deliver some relief next month by cutting interest rates.",
