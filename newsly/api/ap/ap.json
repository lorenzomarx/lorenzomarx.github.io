      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal that the United States \u201ctake over\u201d the Gaza Strip and permanently resettle its Palestinian residents has been swiftly rejected and denounced by American allies and adversaries alike. Saudi Arabia weighed in quickly, noting the kingdom's long call for an independent Palestinian state was a \u201cfirm, steadfast and unwavering position.\u201d Similarly, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters that his country has long supported a two-state solution in the Middle East and that nothing has changed. the militant Hamas group, which sparked the war with its attack on Israel, called the proposal a \u201crecipe for creating chaos\" in the region.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump offered a jaw-dropping performance during his joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggesting that Palestinian refugees from the Gaza Strip could be permanently resettled elsewhere. He suggested on Tuesday that the U.S. could stage a long-term takeover of the vacated region, even leading redevelopment efforts to make it a seaside paradise in waiting. He also refused to rule out sending U.S. troops in to seal the deal and said he himself \u2014 ever the real estate developer \u2014 might pay a personal visit. The suggestions will be non-starters for Hamas, though. And they could jeopardize the continuation of a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages the group is still holding.",

      "description": "Palestinians will mark this year the 77th anniversary of their mass expulsion from what is now Israel. It's an event that is at the core of their national struggle. Palestinians refer to it as the Nakba, Arabic for catastrophe. Some 700,000 Palestinians \u2014 a majority of the prewar population \u2014 fled or were driven from their homes before and during the 1948 war that followed Israel\u2019s establishment. But in many ways, that experience pales in comparison to the calamity now faced in the Gaza Strip \u2014 particularly as President Donald Trump has suggested that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and the U.S. take \u201cownership\u201d of the enclave.",

The U.S. left the Geneva-based Human Rights Council last year.

The department alleged Iranian officials had instructed Farhad Shakeri, 51, in September to focus on surveilling and ultimately assassinating Trump.

It offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities.

      "description": "The U.S. Postal Service said it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong, effective Tuesday. The move comes a day after an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect. Canada and Mexico, which face 25% tariffs, managed to negotiate a month-long reprieve with the U.S. The USPS move will likely impact Chinese e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu, which have in recent years gained e-commerce market share in the U.S for selling affordable clothing and other goods mostly from China. Costs are kept low as these firms often ship products to consumers directly from China, using a \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption that allowed shipments to go tax-free if the value is under $800.",
