      "description": "The nation\u2019s top public health agency is inviting about 180 employees back to work about two weeks after laying them off. Emails went out Tuesday to some Centers for Disease Control and Prevention probationary employees who got termination notices last month. A message seen by the AP was sent with the subject line, \u201cRead this e-mail immediately.\u201d It said that a Feb. 15 termination notice has been rescinded. It\u2019s not clear how many people returned to work Wednesday. And it\u2019s also unclear whether the employees would be spared from further widespread job cuts that are expected soon across government agencies.",

      "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs is planning an \u201caggressive\u201d reorganization that includes cutting 80,000 jobs from the sprawling agency that provides health care for retired military members. That's according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. The VA\u2019s chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, told top level officials at the agency that it had an objective to cut enough employees to return to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000. That would require terminating tens of thousands of employees after the VA expanded under the Biden administration, as well as to cover veterans impacted by burn pits under the 2022 PACT Act.",

      "description": "Farmers and meat producers across the U.S. can expect the new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China and the retaliation to hurt their bottom lines by billions of dollars if they stay in place a while. And consumers could quickly see that result in higher prices at the grocery store for some things. But some of the impact might not be felt until the next harvest and the price of corn, wheat and soybeans accounts for relatively little of the price of most products consumers buy. Plus, President Donald Trump could offer farmers significant aid payments to offset some of the losses. But if the tariffs make farmers and consumers uneasy about spending that would hurt the economy overall.",

It's part of a trip Wednesday meant to highlight tougher immigration policies that the White House says has led to dramatically fewer arrests for illegal crossings since President Donald Trump began his second term. Joined by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Vance viewed the Eagle Pass area by helicopter. The trio also visited a detention facility before holding a roundtable discussion with local and national participants. Arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico fell 39% in January from a month earlier, though they\u2019ve been falling sharply since well before Trump took office",

Musk met later with House Republicans and said he's making \u201cgood progress.\u201d Republicans are eager to show voters the cuts are producing real savings.",
