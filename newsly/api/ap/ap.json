The two victims, a man and a woman, were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum when the 30-year-old suspect approached a group of four people and opened fire, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said. The suspect was observed pacing outside the museum before the shooting, walked into the museum after the shooting and was detained by event security, Smith said.",

      "description": "The two people shot and killed outside a Jewish museum in Washington were young staffers at the Israeli Embassy who were soon to be engaged. The suspect shouted \u201cFree Palestine\u201d as he was being arrested. Israel identified the victims as Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky without giving their ages. They were leaving a young diplomats event at the Capital Jewish Museum that was meant to \u201cfoster unity and celebrate Jewish heritage\u201d when they were killed on Wednesday. Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.S said that Lischinsky had bought an engagement ring and was just days away from proposing to Milgrim on a planned trip to Jerusalem.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court has effectively ended a publicly funded Catholic charter school in Oklahoma, dividing 4-4. Thursday's outcome keeps in place an Oklahoma court decision that invalidated a vote by a state charter school board to approve the St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The school would have been the nation\u2019s first religious charter school. The outcome leaves the issue unresolved nationally. Only eight justices participated, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett sitting it out. The court's one-sentence notice didn't provide a vote breakdown. But based on arguments last month, Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to be the key, and the outcome suggests he went with the court's three liberals to make it 4-4.",

Experts also warn the territory could plunge into famine if Israel doesn\u2019t stop its military campaign and fully lift its blockade. The blockade was in place for more than two months, preventing all food, medicine and other goods from entering the territory that is home to some 2 million Palestinians. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out waves of airstrikes and ground operations. Palestinians in Gaza rely almost entirely on outside aid to survive because Israel\u2019s offensive has destroyed almost all the territory\u2019s food production capabilities.",

The administration said it would challenge the ruling. U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction Thursday stopping the Trump administration from carrying out two plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump\u2019s goal to dismantle the department. It marks a setback to one of the Republican president\u2019s campaign promises. The ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits that said Trump\u2019s plan amounted to an illegal closure of the Education Department.",
