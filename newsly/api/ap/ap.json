      "description": "Democrats are planning to fight President Donald Trump's efforts to pause federal grants and loans. The court battle will likely begin with a lawsuit from the New York attorney general. The funding freeze is scheduled to take effect Tuesday as Trump\u2019s administration begins an across-the-board ideological review. Administration officials said the pause is necessary to ensure that spending complies with the president's executive orders. The Republican administration's decision could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research, education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted. It\u2019s unclear how sweeping the pause will be.",

The email sent to employees says those who leave their posts voluntarily will receive about eight months of salary, but they have to chose to do so by Feb 6.",

He also ordered the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general to review Milley\u2019s actions while serving as the nation\u2019s top uniformed officer to determine if a demotion is warranted, two defense officials confirmed late Tuesday. Milley served as chairman during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office. While the relationship initially went well, it soured deeply and fast, as Milley tried to advise and contain the president on a host of issues. Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff Joe Kasper said that the decision to strip Milley of his clearance and detail was taken because \u201cundermining the chain of command is corrosive to our national security.\"",

The Abu Jarad family returned to Beit Lahiya Monday to find that the orange, olive and palm trees that once stood in front of their house were bulldozed away. The roses and jasmine flowers were also gone. The house itself was a hollowed-out shell. But it stood. At the sight of it, Ne\u2019man Abu Jarad; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters dropped the bags they had been lugging since dawn, fell to their knees and prayed. After 477 days of hell \u2014 fleeing the length of the Gaza Strip, hiding from bombardment, scrounging for food and water \u2013 they were finally home.",

Trump will sign the immigrant detention measure on Wednesday. It mandates the detention and potential deportation of people in the U.S. illegally who are accused of theft and violent crimes before they have actually been convicted. The Laken Riley Act was named for a Georgia nursing student who was killed in 2024 while out for a run by a Venezuelan national in the U.S. illegally. The measure swiftly passed the Republican-controlled Congress with some Democratic support. Immigrant advocates say it could trigger mass roundups over offenses as minor as shoplifting.",
