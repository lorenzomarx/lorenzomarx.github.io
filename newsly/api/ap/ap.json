      "description": "The Kremlin said Thursday that a meeting in the coming days between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump has been agreed on. Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the two sides are working on setting it up, and that a venue for the meeting has been agreed on and will be announced later. A meeting between Putin and Trump would be their first since Trump returned to office this year. It would be a significant milestone in the more than 3-year-old war, though there\u2019s no promise such a meeting would lead to the end of the fighting, since Russia and Ukraine remain far apart on their demands.",

      "description": "The Israeli security cabinet is meeting Thursday evening to discuss expanding military operations in Gaza. An Israeli official says the cabinet is expected to approve a plan to gradually increase pressure on Hamas. Israel\u2019s Chief of Staff warns this could endanger hostages and exhaust troops.

      "description": "President Donald Trump has started imposing higher import taxes on goods from over 60 countries, including the European Union, Japan and South Korea. These tariffs, which began Thursday, are part of Trump's strategy to reduce the trade deficit and encourage foreign investment in the U.S. However, the economic impact is already visible, with signs of stalled hiring, rising inflation and declining home values. Despite the uncertainty, Trump remains optimistic about economic growth, while many experts warn of potential long-term damage.",

The Republican president said Thursday the census' data collections will be based on \u201cmodern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.\u201d It's an indication Trump might try to inject his politics into survey work measuring everything from child poverty to business operations. Trump stresses that as part of the changes people in the U.S. illegally will be excluded from census counts.

All of this aims to boost the GOP\u2019s advantages in upcoming elections. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said that FBI Director Kash Patel has agreed to get involved in corralling Texas Democratic lawmakers who left their state to deny the Republican majority a quorum necessary to vote on a U.S. House redistricting plan.

Overall, about 55% of calories consumed by Americans older than age 1 came from ultra-processed foods during August 2021 to August 2023. The top sources include burgers and sandwiches, sweet baked goods, savory snacks, pizza and sweetened drinks. Ultra-processed foods have been linked to chronic health problems. One surprising finding: Consumption of ultra-processed foods appeared to dip slightly over the past decade. One nutritionist says there may be greater awareness of the foods' potential harms.",
