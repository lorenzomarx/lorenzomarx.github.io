      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to unveil his proposed Board of Peace at the World Economic Forum. It's an idea that was initially envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the Gaza ceasefire. But it has morphed into something far more ambitious. The rollout of the board has been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s pressure campaign over acquiring Greenland. Some European leaders have said they'll take a pass on the new panel that Trump has suggested could eventually make the United Nations obsolete. Trump wants to spotlight the proposed board on Thursday.",

      "description": "Joe Biden promised Europe that \"America is back\" early in his presidency, aiming to mend ties after Donald Trump's tenure. However, nearly five years later, Trump's influence over Europe has grown. Recently, Trump demanded Denmark cede Greenland to the U.S., causing turmoil within NATO. European leaders are responding by exploring alliances that exclude the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney highlighted a global shift, calling the rules-based order an \"illusion.\" European leaders criticized Trump's approach, while some Republicans supported him. Democrats urged stronger responses, stressing the need for a lasting shift in U.S. politics to rebuild trust.",

A high-speed train in southern Spain derailed on Sunday and dozens were killed. Spanish authorities reported more than 150 other people were injured. Another train crash occurred in northeastern Spain and one person was killed. That crash involved a Barcelona commuter train. While Spain\u2019s high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues. However, crashes causing injury or death are not common.",

Among the dead are three Palestinian journalists who were killed while filming near a displacement camp in central Gaza. The Israeli military says it spotted suspects who were operating a drone posing a threat to its troops. Also killed in separate incidents were two 13-year-old boys. The strikes came as the United States is trying to push the ceasefire forward and implement its challenging second phase.",

Geraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. ICE claims the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him. But a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and at least one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious. The autopsy report released Wednesday by the El Paso County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.",

Adrian Gonzales had faced 29 charges of child abandonment and endangerment and up to two years in prison. A jury acquitted him Wednesday. Prosecutors had alleged at trial that Gonzales abandoned his training and could have stopped the gunman outside Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022. Gonzales\u2019 lawyers insisted he never saw the gunman before he entered the school. The trial was a rare prosecution of an officer for allegedly failing to act to stop a crime and protect lives.",
