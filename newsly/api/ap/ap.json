Trump says she told him she \u201cwants to get down to serious negotiations.\" Trump told reporters later Sunday that he had told \u201canybody that would listen, they have to do that.\u201d He said Von der Leyen vowed to \u201crapidly get together and see if we can work something out.\u201d",

      "description": "Minneapolis has changed, slowly, since a city police officer murdered George Floyd on Memorial Day in 2020. The city is still struggling to decide what should become of the intersection where Floyd met his demise, which has become a place of pilgrimage known as George Floyd Square. City leaders have not agreed on whether to close the intersection to all traffic as a permanent memorial. Minneapolis has also begun a remake of its police department under court supervision \u2014 an effort that the mayor and police chief say will continue with or without the backing of the Trump administration.",

The attack early on Sunday came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month which have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers on Saturday, a day after each released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Further releases were expected on Sunday.",

      "description": "As the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in federal funding to scientific research, thousands of scientists in the U.S. lost their jobs or grants. And governments and universities around the world spotted an opportunity and launched programs to lure researchers from the U.S. Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world\u2019s leading scientific power. But today that system is being shaken by deep cuts. The Trump administration says it is reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste and realigning research spending to match the \u201cAmerican people\u2019s priorities.\u201d",
