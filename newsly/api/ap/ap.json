      "description": "Savannah Guthrie has told the potential kidnappers of her mother Nancy Guthrie that the family is prepared to pay for her safe return. Savannah Guthrie appeared in a video on Instagram on Saturday while flanked by her two siblings. She said: \u201cWe received your message and we understand ... This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.\u201d It was not immediately clear if Guthrie was referring to a new message from someone who might have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie. The frantic search for the 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie has entered a seventh day. Authorities have not identified any suspects or ruled anyone out.",

      "description": "Washington Post publisher Will Lewis says he\u2019s stepping down, three days after the troubled newspaper said that it was laying off one-third of its staff. Lewis sent an email to the Post\u2019s staff, saying that \u201cdifficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post.\u201d Lewis and the newspaper\u2019s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, did not participate in a meeting with staff announcing the layoffs this week. The Post\u2019s chief financial officer, Jeff D\u2019Onofrio, was named acting publisher and CEO. The British-born Lewis was a former top executive at The Wall Street Journal before taking over at The Post in January 2024. His tenure has been rocky from the start, marked by layoffs and a failed reorganization plan.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken an unusual step of turning to military leaders for high-level diplomacy. The top U.S. commander in the Middle East is involved in talks over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Trump's Army secretary is engaged in negotiations on trying to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It's not clear whether the military leaders were brought in because of their expertise, connections or to signal potentially tougher options. But the move reflects how the Trump administration has upended traditional U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy. Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are balancing both sets of difficult negotiations.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is facing rare criticism from his Republican Party over a racist video. Trump's White House removed a video that contained a racist image of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama after a bipartisan blowback from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The condemnation from congressional Republicans marked a rare moment of pushback from GOP lawmakers, who otherwise rarely criticize Trump in public. Trump said that he did not support the racist parts of the video and declined to apologize. Democrats and supporters of the Obamas rallied to the former first couple's defense",

The U.S. Department of Justice released documents that have ended careers and sparked investigations. King Charles III's brother lost his titles and home. Ex-U.K. ambassador Peter Mandelson was fired and may face prison. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is in crisis for appointing Mandelson. Norway, Sweden and Slovakia have seen senior figures fall. Experts say the files expose Epstein's powerful network in Europe. The fallout contrasts with a more limited impact so far in the U.S. where only a handful of prominent Epstein associates have lost their jobs.",

      "description": "Democrats are focusing on health care in the November elections and making it a key issue. Republicans have cut Medicaid through new work requirements and they've declined to extend COVID-era subsidies. That's led to increased costs for people covered under Affordable Care Act plans. Democrats are using campaign ads and personal stories to emphasize the impact on Americans. Jon Ossoff is one high-profile Democrat in a tough reelection campaign this year. The Georgia senator plans to address health care at an event Saturday. Republicans have struggled to pass legislation to offset health costs and that's become weak point for them. Democrats see a chance to gain political leverage in the midterms.",
