      "description": "India faces a major challenge as a steep U.S. tariff on Indian products takes effect. The import duties coming into force on Wednesday threaten over half of India's exports to its largest overseas market. The situation highlights the fragile trade ties between the two allies. President Donald Trump initially announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods, but then imposed an additional 25% tariff due to India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil. That brings the combined U.S. tariffs on India to 50%. The Indian government estimates that $48.2 billion worth of exports will be affected. Labor-intensive sectors like textiles and leather will likely be hit hardest. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed not to yield to U.S. pressure.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to fire one of the seven Federal Reserve governors will likely end up in court and could more clearly define the limits of the president\u2019s legal powers over the traditionally independent institution. Legal experts say Trump\u2019s claim he can fire Lisa Cook is on shaky ground. But it\u2019s an unprecedented move that hasn\u2019t played out in the courts before. The Supreme Court this year has been more willing to let the president remove agency officials than in the past. The Republican president said Monday he was removing Cook because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud. Cook was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022 and says she won't step down.",

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen on Tuesday granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise would \"offend the rule of law.\u201d Cullen was nominated by President Donald Trump and serves in Virginia but was tapped to oversee the case because all of Maryland\u2019s federal judges were named as defendants.

Trump has suggested sending federal troops to cities like Chicago and Baltimore, claiming violence is out of control.

They argue crime is falling and accuse Trump of ignoring cities with worse crime rates that have Republican leaders.

      "description": "A rash of hoax calls about active shooters on college campuses has spread fear among students around the country as the school year begins at institutions of higher learning. The calls have prompted schools to issue campus-wide texts to \u201crun, hide, fight.\u201d They've also sent students and teachers running for cover, seeking safety in utility closets or huddling in classrooms. Officers swarmed campuses looking for the threat. In every case, the threat didn\u2019t exist. The hoax calls and false alarms have hit at least 11 college campuses from Arkansas to Pennsylvania. Security experts say that risk remains, but campus officials must find the right balance in keeping students and teachers on guard for any real threats in the future.",

His lawyers are fighting the deportation efforts. They say he has the right to express fear of torture in Uganda and to appeal the decisions of immigration authorities.

A judge ordered lawmakers this week to quickly redraw the state's congressional map. That could make one of Utah\u2019s four congressional seats competitive for Democrats, who are trying to gain control of the U.S. House. The judge says the current map is unlawful because the Republican-controlled Legislature circumvented an independent redistricting commission. The ruling throws Republicans a curveball in a state where they expected a clean sweep. GOP leaders could cut their losses by creating a single left-leaning block, or gamble on creating competitive districts that Republicans will fight to keep.",
