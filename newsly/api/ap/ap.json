      "description": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio says there's been \"good and decent progress\u201d in Venezuela since the United States ousted Nicolas Maduro as leader of the South American country. Rubio has begun his much-anticipated congressional testimony about Venezuela and is defending the Trump administration's military operation. Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings Wednesday of the current situation. Rubio said Venezuela\u2019s interim leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. He said Venezuela will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions, with the revenue set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care.",

      "description": "A man has sprayed an unknown substance on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar before being tackled to the ground during a town hall she was hosting. The incident took place in Minneapolis, where tensions over federal immigration enforcement have come to a head after agents fatally shot an intensive care nurse and a mother of three this month. The audience cheered as the man was pinned down and his arms were tied behind his back. In video of the incident, someone in the crowd can be heard saying, \u201cOh my god, he sprayed something on her.\u201d Omar continued the town hall after he was ushered out of the room.",

      "description": "The chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and has ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn\u2019t be held in contempt. In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained. The order says Schlitz recognizes that ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary, but that the \u201cextent of ICE\u2019s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary.\u201d",

      "description": "Federal Reserve officials are expected to keep their short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday after three cuts last year, ignoring huge pressure for lower borrowing costs from the White House in favor of waiting to see how the economy evolves. A key issue that Chair Jerome Powell will likely address at his news conference Wednesday is how long the Fed will remain on hold. The rate-setting committee remains split between those officials opposed to further cuts until inflation comes down, and those who want to lower rates to further support hiring. In December, just 12 of the 19 participants in the committee\u2019s meetings supported at least one more rate cut this year.",

Mississippi's Department of Transportation dispatched tow trucks and drones late Tuesday to frozen Interstate 55, where three tractor-trailers had stalled and caused a major backup. Gov. Tate Reeves said in social media post that highways remained dangerous Wednesday morning and urged people to stay off the roads. More than 380,000 people, mostly in Mississippi and Tennessee, remain without power days after a winter storm blasted the eastern U.S. with snow and ice. The East Coast could see more snowfall this weekend.",

Trump\u2019s lawyers told the court speed was of the essence on an issue central to the Republican president\u2019s economic agenda. But nearly three months have elapsed since arguments in the closely watched case, and the court isn\u2019t scheduled to meet in public for more than three weeks. No one knows what's going on among the nine justices. But the timeline for deciding the tariffs case now looks more or less typical and could reflect the normal back-and-forth that occurs not just in the biggest cases but in almost all the disputes the justices hear.",

The worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes the Episcopal Church in the U.S., has no formal head, but the archbishop traditionally has been seen as its spiritual leader. Mullally, a cancer nurse turned cleric, officially took up the responsibilities of her new job Wednesday as judges presided over a legal ceremony confirming her appointment, which was announced almost four months ago. The Church of England ordained its first female priests in 1994 and its first female bishop in 2015.",

That's according to a study showing night owls had poorer overall cardiovascular health than most people, plus a modestly higher risk of a first heart attack or stroke. Unhealthy behaviors like too little sleep, smoking and a poor diet were key reasons. The body's circadian rhythm, or internal clock, governs when people feel sleepy and awake. Researchers say night owls will have to work harder on healthy behaviors like getting enough sleep in a morning person's world \u2014 but the health advice is good for everyone.",
