      "description": "Food, music and culture have made the Italian southern city of Naples famous around the globe. But there\u2019s another Neapolitan tradition that fascinates locals and visitors alike: the cornicello, an iconic symbol of prosperity, love and fortune that has become a popular present among lovers on Valentine\u2019s Day. The cornicello is a traditional amulet that in Neapolitan culture represents good luck and protection against the evil eye. Its shape, resembling a small horn, is associated with fertility and strength, while the red, intense color is considered a powerful antidote against negative energies.",

Animal shelters and zoos around the country are encouraging little cathartic acts of revenge this holiday \u2014 and raising money for a cause \u2014 with a slew of darkly funny fundraisers. At an Anchorage bird treatment center, you can name a frozen rat for your ex and get a video of it being eaten by a raptor. In Memphis, you can memorialize your former lover's name over a video of an elephant pooping. And many shelters are offering to name a feral cat after your ex \u2014 and then neutering it.",

      "description": "Lovers have always batted their eyes on Valentine\u2019s Day as cherubs circled overhead. Or have they? Historians aren\u2019t sure where the holiday comes from, but many myths claim to to explain its origin. For years, they thought it had something to do an ancient Roman fertility festival held in mid-February called Lupercalia. That coincided with the supposed martyrdom of one of two St. Valentines. But some historians now think the English writer Geoffrey Chaucer was the first to associate the holiday with love in the 14th century. It would be another 400 years or so before cards and heart-shaped boxes came into play.",

To achieve the cake\u2019s deep, complex chocolatiness, the cooks at Christopher Kimball\u2019s Milk Street use a generous amount of bittersweet chocolate and unsweetened cocoa powder. Any type of bittersweet chocolate will work, but for best results use one that\u2019s tasty enough to eat out of hand and contains about70 percent cocoa solids. Serve slices with spoonfuls of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, which has a subtle tang and creaminess that are fantastic foils for the cake.",

Now home in Israel, they are confronting a flood of information about loved ones and destroyed communities, and are still figuring out their place in a changed world. Their families are grappling with how to fill them in on what they missed without potentially deepening their trauma. One hostage forced to speak at a staged Hamas ceremony before his release told a crowd of masked militants and journalists that he was looking forward to seeing his wife and two teenage daughters. It wasn't until he arrived back in Israel that he learned the crushing reality: all three had been killed during the Oct. 7 attack.",

Modi said he and Musk discussed various issues including space, mobility, technology and innovation, but made no direct reference to the billionaire's Starlink satellite internet services. Musk has long wanted Starlink to make an entry into the Indian market.
