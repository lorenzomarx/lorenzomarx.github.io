      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken an unusual step of turning to military leaders for high-level diplomacy. The top U.S. commander in the Middle East is involved in talks over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Trump's Army secretary is engaged in negotiations on trying to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It's not clear whether the military leaders were brought in because of their expertise, connections or to signal potentially tougher options. But the move reflects how the Trump administration has upended traditional U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy. Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are balancing both sets of difficult negotiations.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is facing rare criticism from his Republican Party over a racist video. Trump's White House removed a video that contained a racist image of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama after a bipartisan blowback from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The condemnation from congressional Republicans marked a rare moment of pushback from GOP lawmakers, who otherwise rarely criticize Trump in public. Trump said that he did not support the racist parts of the video and declined to apologize. Democrats and supporters of the Obamas rallied to the former first couple's defense",

      "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein files have rocked Europe's elite, revealing ties to a prince, an ambassador, and top politicians. The U.S. Department of Justice released documents that have ended careers and sparked investigations. King Charles III's brother lost his titles and home. Ex-U.K. ambassador Peter Mandelson was fired and may face prison. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is in crisis for appointing Mandelson. Norway, Sweden and Slovakia have seen senior figures fall. Experts say the files expose Epstein's powerful network in Europe. The fallout contrasts with a more limited impact so far in the U.S. where only a handful of prominent Epstein associates have lost their jobs.",

      "description": "Democrats are focusing on health care in the November elections and making it a key issue. Republicans have cut Medicaid through new work requirements and they've declined to extend COVID-era subsidies. That's led to increased costs for people covered under Affordable Care Act plans. Democrats are using campaign ads and personal stories to emphasize the impact on Americans. Jon Ossoff is one high-profile Democrat in a tough reelection campaign this year. The Georgia senator plans to address health care at an event Saturday. Republicans have struggled to pass legislation to offset health costs and that's become weak point for them. Democrats see a chance to gain political leverage in the midterms.",

Alberto Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n says federal agents began hitting him right after they pulled him from a vehicle. He was hospitalized with eight skull fractures and five life-threatening brain hemorrhages. Officers claimed he ran into a wall, but medical staff immediately doubted that account. His case has sparked calls for accountability and transparency. Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n, who entered the U.S. legally, faces a long recovery and uncertain future. He hopes to stay in the U.S. and support his family despite fears of another encounter with ICE.",

That word comes from two Trump administration officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting hasn't yet been formally announced and details of its agenda are still being determined. It's not clear how many leaders will come.",
