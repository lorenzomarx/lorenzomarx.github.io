      "description": "Protests over federal immigration enforcement raids and President Donald Trump\u2019s move to mobilize the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles are spreading nationwide and are expected to continue into the weekend. While many have been peaceful, with marchers chanting slogans and carrying signs against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, some protesters have clashed with police, leading to hundreds of arrests and the use of chemical irritants to disperse crowds. Activists say they will hold even larger demonstrations in the coming days with \u201cNo Kings\u201d events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump\u2019s planned military parade through Washington, D.C.",

His comments came Thursday during a hotly combative congressional hearing, where he refused to answer repeated questions about his use of a Signal chat to discuss military operations. Democratic members of the House Armed Services Committee got into heated exchanges with Hegseth, demanding yes or no answers as he tried to avoid direct responses about his actions as Pentagon chief. Asked whether the Pentagon has plans to take Greenland or Panama by force if necessary, Hegseth responded that \u201cour job at the Defense Department is to have plans for any contingency.\"",

The governors of Illinois, Minnesota and New York testified Thursday before the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating sanctuary jurisdictions. The hearing comes amid heightened tensions and protests over President Donald Trump's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws. Trump's administration recently listed Illinois, Minnesota and New York among hundreds of jurisdictions it says are defying federal immigration law. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz rejected the description of his state as a sanctuary jurisdiction but said immigration enforcement is not the role of state and local governments.",

The decision to end deliberations Thursday came a day after the jury delivered a partial verdict. The foreperson complained Wednesday that he felt bullied by another juror and said Thursday he wouldn\u2019t go back into the jury room. The panel convicted the ex-studio boss of one of the top charges but acquitted him of another. Both of those charges concerned accusations of forcing oral sex on women in 2006. Those verdicts still stand. The jury got stuck on a third charge. It was a rape accusation dating to 2013.",
