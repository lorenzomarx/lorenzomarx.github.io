      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to meet with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland to discuss trade. Both sides are seeking an agreement on tariff rates. Trump played golf Saturday at his course in Turnberry and plans to visit another one in Aberdeen, where his family is opening a new Trump course. The meeting Sunday with von der Leyen is expected to be private. Trump mentioned a 50-50 chance of reaching a deal with the EU. The U.S. had threatened a 30% tariff rate on the EU and Trump has set a deadline for Friday. Without a deal, the EU could retaliate with tariffs on American products.",

      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a sweeping trade deal. It raises tariffs on most European goods to 15%, warding off Trump\u2019s threat of a 30% rate if no deal had been reached by Aug. 1. The tariffs, or import taxes, paid when Americans buy European products could raise prices for U.S. consumers and slow growth in both the U.S. and Europe. But the deal appears to ward off a worse escalation of trade tensions.",

Starting Sunday, the military will halt activity in Muwasi, Deir al-Balah, and Gaza City from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time daily.

      "description": "A regional passenger train has derailed in southern Germany, killing at least three people and seriously injuring others. The crash happened on Sunday near Riedlingen, about 158 kilometers west of Munich. Federal and local police say the cause of the crash is still under investigation. Storms passed through the area before the crash and investigators were seeking to determine if the rain was a factor. Photos from the scene show parts of the train on its side, with rescuers climbing atop the carriages. It is unclear how many people were injured, but roughly 100 people were onboard when at least two carriages derailed. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz mourned the victims and gave his condolences to their families.",

      "description": "U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting in Stockholm to discuss trade tariffs and a potential summit between their leaders. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are holding talks, marking their third meeting this year. Analysts say they are likely to agree on maintaining current tariff levels while working toward a more lasting trade deal. The U.S. currently taxes Chinese goods at 30%, while China imposes a 10% tariff. The talks may also address issues like China\u2019s industrial overcapacity and fentanyl-related tariffs, with hopes of reaching a deal to be announced when U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping possibly meet later this year.",

Experts say Native American mascots have long been linked to negative mental health outcomes, especially for children.
