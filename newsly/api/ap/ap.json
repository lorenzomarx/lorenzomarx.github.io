The family\u2019s latest attempts to reach the abductors failed to yield any proof that she's alive or communication with the culprits. The FBI says it's not aware of ongoing communication between the family and the suspected kidnappers. The FBI says it hasn't identified any suspects or persons of interest in the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie. Guthrie says her family in Arizona continues to believe her mother is out there and hearing everyone\u2019s prayers. By Monday evening, a purported ransom deadline apparently set by her mom\u2019s abductors appeared to have passed.",

The allegations outlined in the affidavit are largely based on claims that have long been made by people who assert that there was fraud in the 2020 election. Audits, state officials, courts and Trump\u2019s own former attorney general have rejected the idea that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election that could have altered the outcome.",

The hearing follows the shooting deaths of two Americans in Minneapolis, which sparked outrage over the president's agenda.

He was questioned by Democrats during a Tuesday subcommittee hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
