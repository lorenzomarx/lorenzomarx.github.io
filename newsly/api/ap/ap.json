      "description": "Pope Francis\u2019 body will be moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to lie in state allowing the Catholic faithful to pay their respects to the Argentine pope. Francis is being remembered for his humble style, concern for the poor and insistent prayers for peace. Heads of state are expected for the funeral Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square. But the three days of public viewing are largely for ordinary Catholics to mourn the 88-year-old pope. Francis died Monday after suffering a stroke. His body will be transferred Wednesday morning to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The public mourning period will end on Friday night.",

Egypt and Qatar are still developing the proposal, which would include the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the entire strip and the release of Palestinian prisoners.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday says the policy put in place by President Donald Trump has left the national trade policy subject to Trump's whims rather than the sound exercise of lawful authority. The lawsuit challenges Trump's claim that he could arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. A message sent to the Justice Department for comment was not immediately returned.",

Tens of thousands of armed police and soldiers fanned out across the region and erected additional checkpoints. Police called it a \u201cterror attack\u201d and blamed militants fighting against Indian rule. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.",
