      "description": "UK police have arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Prince Andrew, on suspicion of misconduct in public office. On Thursday, Thames Valley Police said they opened an investigation after assessing reports about his alleged contact with Jeffrey Epstein. Police did not name him, which follows U.K. practice, but they confirmed they arrested a man in his 60s. Police say they want to protect the integrity of the investigation. They also said the case drawed strong public interest and they planned to share updates at the right time. Pictures online also appeared to show police cars and officers outside his home.",

      "description": "The former Prince Andrew is the first senior British royal in modern history to be arrested by police. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was detained Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, in an investigation stemming from his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He was born in 1960, the second child of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip. He spent 22 years in the Royal Navy, serving as a helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands War. Andrew was named Britain\u2019s special representative for international trade in 2001. He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 amid growing concern about his friendship with Epstein. Last year that friendship cost him his royal title and honors.",

Thursday's inaugural meeting will focus on reconstruction for a war-battered Gaza. But ahead of the gathering, the Gaza ceasefire deal remains fragile and Trump\u2019s expanded vision for the board has triggered fears that he's looking to create a rival to the United Nations. A senior Trump administration official said more than 40 countries and the European Union have confirmed they will send officials. Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board but are expected to attend.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is weighing military action against Iran, leading an immigration crackdown, and teasing a federal takeover of state elections. But on Thursday, White House insists he will focus on the economy when he visits battleground Georgia. The trip aims to boost the Republican president\u2019s political standing heading into the high-stakes midterm elections. The White House has long said the president would focus more on the economy, but recent months have been dominated by his immigration crackdown, global conflicts and his interest in nationalizing state elections, among other issues. Trump\u2019s visit comes less than a month after federal agents seized voting records and ballots from Fulton County, home to the state\u2019s largest concentration of Democrats.",

Meanwhile, the Americans brought another aircraft carrier closer to the Mideast, the USS Gerald R. Ford. The movements of additional American warships and airplanes to the region don\u2019t guarantee a U.S. strike on Iran. But it does give President Donald Trump the ability to carry out one should he choose to do so. Meanwhile, Iran struggles with unrest at home following its deadly crackdown on protests.

Search and rescue crews were dispatched to the Castle Peak area of the Sierra Nevada after a 911 call reporting an avalanche Tuesday morning. Six others were found alive. Heavy snow and the threat of additional avalanches slowed the rescue effort in the mountains near Castle Peak, northwest of Lake Tahoe. Authorities have told the families the mission has moved from rescue to recovery. They say the eight victims were found fairly close together, and that three of them were discovered by the skiers who survived.",
