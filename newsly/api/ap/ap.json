      "description": "Israeli troops have opened fire on Palestinians near food distribution hubs in southern Gaza, killing at least 32 people. Witnesses say the shootings happened Saturday as crowds approached centers run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The foundation, established to replace U.N.-led aid efforts, claims Hamas diverts supplies, a charge the U.N. denies. Local health officials report hundreds have died near these hubs in recent months. Gaza faces a dire humanitarian crisis, with over 2 million residents on the brink of famine. The ongoing conflict has caused massive casualties and displacement, with no progress in ceasefire talks.",

      "description": "Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has urged Sunni Bedouin tribes to honor a ceasefire aimed at ending deadly clashes with Druze-linked militias Sweida. The violence has left hundreds dead and drawn Israeli airstrikes targeting Syrian forces. Al-Sharaa blamed \"armed groups from Sweida\u201d for reigniting the conflict on Thursday and criticized Israeli intervention. A separate U.S.-brokered ceasefire was announced early Saturday between Syria and Israel, but tensions remain high. Al-Sharaa emphasized unity, vowing to protect minorities and thanking the U.S. and Arab mediators for their support during Syria\u2019s ongoing crisis.",

      "description": "When House Speaker Mike Johnson gifted to President Donald Trump the gavel used to enact the Republicans' tax breaks and spending bill, it was a memorable moment at the White House. The image from the bill signing on Independence Day underscored the symbolic transfer of political power from a compliant Congress to the White House during Trump's second term. Since Trump\u2019s return to office in January, the Republicans in control of Congress have shown an unusual willingness to give the president of their party what he wants. And that poses a risk to Congress, an equal branch of government but one the Founding Fathers placed first in the Constitution.",

By his six-month mark in office on July 20, Trump will have made 49 trips to 14 states and seven foreign countries. That\u2019s not far off from Biden's pace. The Democrat made 45 trips to 17 states and three foreign countries early in his presidency during the pandemic. Trump\u2019s second-term travel is also less prolific than his first, at least in terms of visiting different parts of the United States.",

Minnesota stopped coverage for adults, and Illinois ended its program for people ages 42-64. California will cap enrollment starting next year. Doctors and advocates say it will only cost states more in the long run because more people will end up in hospitals.
