      "description": "U.S. immigration officials say they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia's defense attorneys wrote in a Saturday court filing that the Costa Rica offer came on Thursday when it was clear he would likely be released the following day. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday. Separately, prosecutors then gave him until Monday to accept the plea deal. His attorneys declined to say if he's still considering it.",

      "description": "The Trump administration plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined a plea deal involving deportation to Costa Rica. This development follows his release from a Tennessee jail on Friday. Abrego Garcia's case has drawn attention amid President Trump's immigration crackdown. He was mistakenly deported in March and returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem criticized his release, vowing to ensure he faces justice. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue the charges are vindictive, and a trial is set for January.",

      "description": "Soon after arriving at a Gaza City hospital, Texas surgeon Mohammed Adeel Khaleel examined a 17-year-old with gunshot wounds sustained when he went to an aid site. The teen whose ribs protruded from his emaciated torso was just one of many patients showing signs of severe malnutrition. When doctors at Al-Ahli Hospital stabilized him, he raised his heavily bandaged hand and pointed to his empty mouth. He and other doctors didn't have to wait until the pronouncement Friday by the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises that Gaza's largest city is gripped by famine. They see evidence of deprivation in the patients right in front of them.",

Israeli forces on Sunday killed four aid seekers in a military zone where convoys have been overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds traveling to an aid distribution point. Hospital officials and eyewitness reported the deaths in the Netzarim corridor as Palestinians in northern Gaza braces for a new Israeli offensive. Gaza City is the largest city in the besieged strip and where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltering. Israel has invaded multiple times and believes a network of tunnels used by militants lie beneath the city.",

He now appears to be fulfilling that campaign promise while threatening to expand his powers well beyond Washington. The actions look like the payback Trump said he would pursue after being hit with four separate sets of criminal charges during his four years out of office. Democrats and others fear Trump is wielding the authority of his office to intimidate his political opponents and consolidate power in a way unlike any other in American history.

It is renewing hope for Democrats as they gain attention for pushing back against the GOP redistricting efforts led by President Donald Trump. Republican rivals are using the moment to burnish their leadership credentials. Texas Democrats have ended a two-week walkout aimed at stopping a Republican effort to redraw districts before the 10-year timeline in order to secure Trump more allies in the U.S. House during the 2026 midterms.",

      "description": "Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House\u2019s demands. For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump\u2019s relentless hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September. It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation that remains a problem and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.",

He delivered the message during an audience Saturday with refugees from Chagos, a contested Indian Ocean archipelago that is home to a strategic U.S.-U.K. military base. Leo strongly affirmed the right of the Chagossian people to return to their homes and hailed the recent treaty with Mauritius about the island's future as symbolically important on the international stage. Leo met with a delegation of refugees from Chagos, some 2,000 of whom who were evicted from their homes by Britain in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. could build a naval and bomber base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia.",
