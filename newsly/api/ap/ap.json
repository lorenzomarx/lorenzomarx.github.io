      "description": "Health workers and aid groups fear hunger that has been building in Gaza for months under Israel's blockade is now reaching a tipping point into accelerating death. The Gaza Health Ministry says that in the past three weeks, at least 48 people died of causes related to malnutrition, including 20 children. That\u2019s up from 10 children who died in the five previous months of 2025. At the main emergency center for malnourished kids in northern Gaza, five children died in rapid succession over four days last week, with staff unable to treat them because key medicines had run out.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump plans to visit the Federal Reserve as his allies scrutinize its expensive building renovations. It's a highly personal and confrontational escalation of Trump's campaign to pressure the central bank to slash interest rates. Trump administration officials have used concerns about the Washington building overhaul to cast doubt on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s decision making. The Trump administration officials are scheduled to inspect the site Thursday. The White House says the Republican president will also be visiting. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the chair has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3%. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "description": "Justice Department officials will meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned girlfriend of financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. That's according to a person familiar with the matter. The person tells The Associated Press the meeting is Thursday in Florida, where Maxwell is held. The meeting is part of a Justice Department effort to cast itself as transparent following backlash from parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s base over an earlier refusal to release additional Epstein records. A Justice Department spokesman hasn't returned a message seeking comment. A lawyer for Maxwell says she'll \"always testify truthfully.\u201d Maxwell was convicted of helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Epstein died in a New York jail awaiting trial.",

But at least some of the information in the briefing to Trump, which The Wall Street Journal said took place in May, should not have been a surprise. His association with Epstein is well-established and his name was included in records that his own Justice Department released back in February.
