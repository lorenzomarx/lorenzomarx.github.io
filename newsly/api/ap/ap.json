The prime minister told the BBC he believes the U.S. president wants a durable peace in Ukraine. He repeated his assertion that American security guarantees will be needed to make it stick.

      "description": "Britain is hosting a summit of European leaders to shore up support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump that left many uncertain where the once staunch allies stood. The London meeting on Sunday has now taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally and boosting the continent\u2019s defenses. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will welcome leaders of more than a dozen countries and other officials to the gathering, embraced Zelenskyy on his arrival in London, saying he is determined to find an end to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",

      "description": "Key Republicans and Democrats have been stalwart supporters of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But a blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to sign a deal Friday that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Instead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance further splintered American political support for Ukraine. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has backed Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster.\"",

      "description": "Ukrainians have rallied around President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a defender of their country\u2019s interests in the hours after he left the White House after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump. Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy during an Oval Office meeting on Friday for what they saw as a lack of gratitude for past U.S. aid, a confrontation that pleased Moscow. The friction cast doubt on future U.S. support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia. But despite the diplomatic fallout, many Ukrainians supported Zelenskyy\u2019s firm stance. Officials across Ukraine praised their leader's resilience, while some cautioned against losing crucial U.S. backing.",

It also shows the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect U.S. foreign policy priorities toward his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term. The episode has left in doubt the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia.",

The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday.

Communities on either side of the line that divides the United States and Canada are closely intertwined. Residents of Skagway, Alaska, shop in the capital of the Yukon because it's easier to get there than Juneau. Auto parts sometimes travel multiple times between Detroit and Ontario. Craft beer makers in Buffalo, New York, use Canadian aluminum cans. The director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University says a trade dispute will produce far-reaching effects, from price increases to longer waits at border crossings.",

Named for a rare species of fireflies, Blue Ghost blasted off from Florida in January. Two other companies' landers are hot on its heels, with the next one targeting a landing later this week.

Compared to last Ramadan, many found relief in the truce \u2014 but there is also worry and fear about what\u2019s next and grief over the grave losses, raw wounds and numerous scars left behind. Some lamented harsh living conditions and economic hardships. Others are searching for ways to bring some Ramadan cheer and make ends meet. Those efforts saw a setback on Sunday as Israel cut off all aid and other supplies to Gaza to pressure Hamas to accept a new proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire.",
