      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill will cut taxes by $3.75 trillion but increase deficits by $2.4 trillion and leave 10.9 million more people without health insurance over the next decade. That\u2019s according to an analysis released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The analysis comes as the Republican president is pushing to have the final product on his desk by July Fourth. The CBO's findings will be weighed by lawmakers and others seeking to understand the budgetary impacts of the sprawling bill. The White House and Republican leaders have been sowing doubt on the CBO\u2019s work. Democrats say Republicans explode the debt when they\u2019re in power.",

That\u2019s a problem for a Republican Congress that has spent much of the past four years criticizing Joe Biden and Democrats for the nation\u2019s rising debt levels.

U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg ruled Wednesday that the administration has to give people a way to contest their deportations under under an 18th-century wartime law. He said they must also be able to dispute allegations that they are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The ruling is the latest milestone in a monthslong legal saga over the fate of deportees imprisoned at El Salvador\u2019s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center.",

Authorities arrested 32-year-old Daniel Park on Tuesday night in New York upon his return from Poland. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli say Park shipped 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to Guy Edward Bartkus, who bombed the clinic. The chemical compound is an explosive precursor that can be used to make homemade bombs, Essayli said. Park also traveled to Southern California in late January to stay with Bartkus for about two weeks, Essayli said. Bartkus was killed in the explosion.",

That came after health officials said dozens of Palestinians were killed in a series of shootings near the sites this week. Separately, officials said Israeli strikes across the territory killed 26 people overnight and into Wednesday. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it was in discussions with the Israeli military on better guiding foot traffic near its distribution sites and enhancing military procedures. Gaza health officials, the Red Cross and the U.N. rights office said 27 people were killed Tuesday. Witnesses blamed Israeli forces. Israel\u2019s military said it fired near people it described as suspects and that it is looking into reports of casualties.",

To attract the brightest minds to America, President Donald Trump proposed during his campaign he would grant green cards to all foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. But that promise never came to pass. International students have found themselves at the center of an escalating campaign to kick them out or keep them from coming as his administration merges a crackdown on immigration with an effort to reshape higher education.",
