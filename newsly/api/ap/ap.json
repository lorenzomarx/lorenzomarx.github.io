      "description": "Ukrainian officials say that a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least twelve people and injuring dozens. The attack early on Sunday came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month which have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers on Saturday, a day after each released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Further releases were expected on Sunday.",

They say the practice has become ubiquitous over 19 months of war. Israel\u2019s military says it prohibits using civilians as shields, a practice it's long accused Hamas of using.

The melanin in darker skin offers some extra protection from the sun, but dermatologists say that isn\u2019t enough on its own. Sunscreen does help prevent skin cancer, but the cancers affecting Black people tend not to be sun-related. Dermatologists say sunscreen is an additional protective layer that helps prevent a host of other skin problems including sunburns, rosacea and dark patches.
