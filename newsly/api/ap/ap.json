      "description": "The Senate is muscling Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination as defense secretary toward confirmation. The Republican senators are prioritizing the former Fox News host and combat veteran\u2019s vow to create a \u201cwarrior culture\u201d at the Pentagon over allegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behavior toward women. Votes are expected by Friday evening. Confirming Hegseth would round out President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security Cabinet officials. It would also show Trump's ability to get what he wants from the Republican-led Senate considering his outsider nominees. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe won confirmation within days of Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",

      "description": "The Senate has advanced the nomination of Pete Hegseth as President Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary. Thursday's vote pushed Hegseth toward confirmation, despite grave objections from Democrats and stirring unease among Republicans over his behavior and qualifications to lead the U.S. military. Two Republicans, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, broke ranks to oppose Hegseth. The former combat veteran and Fox News host faces allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive actions toward women, which he has denied. A final confirmation vote is expected Friday.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court has agreed to take on a new culture war dispute: whether the nation\u2019s first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma. The justices said Friday they would review an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that invalidated a state board\u2019s approval of an application by the Catholic Church in Oklahoma to open a charter school. The conservative-dominated high court has issued several decisions in recent years signaling a willingness to allow public funds to flow to religious entities. At the same time, conservative-led states have sought to insert religion into public schools, including Louisiana\u2019s requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms.",

      "description": "People are listing phones preloaded with TikTok for tens of thousands of dollars on eBay, Facebook marketplace and other online storefronts. But it is not clear if there are many buyers at those prices. TikTok was briefly unavailable to U.S. users over the weekend, but as of Sunday anyone who had previously downloaded it has been able to use it. But the app is still not available for download on Apple and Google\u2019s app stores, so anyone who didn\u2019t think to get TikTok before Sunday is out of luck. As a result, some entrepreneurial spirits are selling phones and tablets that have TikTok \u2014 and other apps from its parent company ByteDance, such as Lemon8 and video editor CapCut. On eBay, listings could be found for as much as $50,000 (or as little as $340) on Friday.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is heading to hurricane-battered western North Carolina and wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles. It's the first trip of his second term. Trump has frequently blended politics and disasters, and Friday will likely be no different. He has sharply criticized President Joe Biden's administration for its handling of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and he's suggested withholding money from California unless it changes water policies. Trump will follow those stops with a Saturday victory rally in Las Vegas, where he plans to start detailing how he can begin keeping a campaign promise to exclude tips from federal taxes.",

That's according to a person familiar with the matter. Fauci is the latest in a string of former Trump aides-turned-critics to see their federal protection canceled despite ongoing threats to their lives. Speaking to reporters Friday in North Carolina, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t feel any responsibility if harm befell the former government officials. A person familiar with the matter says Fauci\u2019s federal security detail was ended on Thursday and he has since hired private security.",

      "description": "Like most presidents, Donald Trump faces an economy that seldom bends to political ambitions. The Republican has promised strong growth, high tariffs, income tax cuts and booming oilfields. But despite the solid job market and low 4.1% unemployment rate, he has to contend with headwinds like inflation, a budget deficit, increased tensions over trade, the fallout from his plans to curtail immigration and a persistent wealth gap. Each of these issues could help to shape how voters feel about a president they returned to the White House with the specific goal of fixing the economy.",

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults strongly or somewhat approve of President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk leads. The poll shows Americans aren\u2019t broadly worried about a government filled with \u201cdeep state\u201d actors poised to undermine Trump\u2019s Republican agenda. They're also ambivalent about some of the changes Trump has mentioned, including eliminating large numbers of federal jobs and moving federal agencies outside Washington.",
