      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill will cut taxes by $3.75 trillion but increase deficits by $2.4 trillion and leave 10.9 million more people without health insurance over the next decade. That\u2019s according to an analysis released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The analysis comes as the Republican president is pushing to have the final product on his desk by July Fourth. The CBO's findings will be weighed by lawmakers and others seeking to understand the budgetary impacts of the sprawling bill. The White House and Republican leaders have been sowing doubt on the CBO\u2019s work. Democrats say Republicans explode the debt when they\u2019re in power.",

      "description": "A small, government office with some 275 employees has found itself caught in the political crossfire as Congress debates President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cone big beautiful bill.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the legislation would increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over 10 years. That\u2019s a problem for a Republican Congress that has spent much of the past four years criticizing Joe Biden and Democrats for the nation\u2019s rising debt levels. The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are taking issue with CBO\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, Democrats are touting CBO\u2019s findings as evidence of the bill\u2019s failings.",

That came after health officials said dozens of Palestinians were killed in a series of shootings near the sites this week. Separately, officials said Israeli strikes across the territory killed 26 people overnight and into Wednesday. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it was in discussions with the Israeli military on better guiding foot traffic near its distribution sites and enhancing military procedures. Gaza health officials, the Red Cross and the U.N. rights office said 27 people were killed Tuesday. Witnesses blamed Israeli forces. Israel\u2019s military said it fired near people it described as suspects and that it is looking into reports of casualties.",

Authorities arrested 32-year-old Daniel Park on Tuesday night in New York upon his return from Poland. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli say Park shipped 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to Guy Edward Bartkus, who bombed the clinic. The chemical compound is an explosive precursor that can be used to make homemade bombs, Essayli said. Park also traveled to Southern California in late January to stay with Bartkus for about two weeks, Essayli said. Bartkus was killed in the explosion.",

Three of the four died in hospital. Erin Patterson denies the charges against her but she accepts that the beef Wellington meal she served contained the poisonous mushrooms. Prosecutors say the poisoning was deliberate but the defense says it was a tragic accident. Patterson faces life in prison if convicted. The trial is to continue on Thursday.",

And that\u2019s just how the ruling Communist Party wants it. Security was tight Wednesday around Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, where weeks of student-led protests shook the party in 1989. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed in a June 4 crackdown. The Communist Party bans any public commemoration of the events. In recent years, that ban has been extended to Hong Kong. It is only in Taiwan that June 4 gatherings can still take place. The self-governing island is claimed by China but runs its own affairs",
