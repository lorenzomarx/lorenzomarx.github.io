      "description": "Days before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Ukrainians are as somber and tense as they were right before Moscow launched the war. Only now, they aren\u2019t just worried about their longtime enemy. Ukraine\u2019s stunning new threat comes from its once staunchest ally, the United States. U.S. support appears to be fading as President Donald Trump parrots the propaganda of Russian President Vladimir Putin as he pledges to stop the fighting between the two countries. After their initial shock at Trump\u2019s false claims this week that Ukraine is led by a \u201cdictator\u201d who started the war with Russia, the Ukrainian people are rallying around a defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who publicly criticized Trump for promoting Russian \u201cdisinformation.\u201d",

      "description": "Political and military leaders in Europe are fleshing out details of a plan for European forces to help ensure Moscow does not attack Ukraine again once the guns fall silent. The proposal backed by Britain and France would see fewer than 30,000 European troops on the ground in in Ukraine, backed by Western air and sea power. The proposal will likely be on the agenda when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron visit Washington next week to meet President Donald Trump. Starmer has stressed that the force won\u2019t work without U.S. military might to back it up. Persuading Trump to provide it could be a tall order.",

      "description": "A news conference that was planned to follow talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine envoy has been canceled. The cancellation happened Thursday as political tensions deepened between the two countries over how to end the almost three-year war with Russia. The event was originally supposed to include comments to the media by Zelenskyy and retired U.S. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg. But it was changed at the last minute to a simple photo opportunity where two leaders posed for journalists. They did not deliver statements or field questions. A Ukrainian presidential spokesman said the change was requested by the U.S. side.",

Waltz said the frustration with Zelenskyy is \u201cmultifold\" and said Zelenskyy needs to demonstrate \u201cdeep appreciation\u201d for what U.S. taxpayers and Trump have done for Ukraine.",

They are staying late Thursday to debate a $340 billion package Trump\u2019s team says it needs for mass deportations and security measures that top the Republican agenda. It's a sight to see: Senators will be voting in rapid-fashion for hours on one amendment after another diving into intricate policy details, largely from Democrats trying to halt the package. Even if the Senate package is approved, it still needs to be merged with one from the House, which is preparing Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that includes some $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and up to $2 trillion less spending.",

On Thursday, the designation of eight Latin America-based criminal organizations was published in the U.S. Federal Register, carrying out a Jan. 20 executive order by Trump. The U.S. hopes the designation, something usually reserved for terrorist groups with political rather than economic objectives, will increase pressure on the groups. Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Thursday that Mexico wouldn\u2019t allow outside involvement in investigations or prosecutions without authorization and collaboration of the Mexican government.",
