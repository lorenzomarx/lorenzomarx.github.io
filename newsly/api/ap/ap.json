      "description": "An AP-NORC poll finds that only about one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Elon Musk after his brief foray into the federal government. And about two-thirds of U.S. adults think he has too much influence in Washington. Musk has spent years building his reputation as a business titan and tech visionary, but the billionaire entrepreneur is expected to leave his administration job in the coming weeks. Musk is noticeably less popular than is the effort to pare back the government workforce. Although about half of U.S. adults believe President Donald Trump has gone too far, 31% say he\u2019s on target and 15% want him to go even further.",

The facility purportedly linked to an earlier delivery of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant.

While Iran\u2019s military sought to deny the delivery of ammonium perchlorate from China, new videos emerged showing an apocalyptic scene at the still-smoldering port.",

The visits came a day after Pope Francis was bade farewell by the powerful of the world and a crowd of hundreds of thousands. A single white rose was placed on the tomb that said \u201cFranciscus\u201d \u2014 the pope\u2019s name in Latin. A light cast its warm glow over the tomb and a reproduction of the late pontiff\u2019s pectoral cross on the wall above it.

The airstrike on Sunday targeted what Israel says are Hezbollah facilities. A warning was issued before the strike. It prompted panicked evacuations across the southern suburbs. An earlier drone strike killed a man in southern Lebanon. Israel says it targeted a Hezbollah member rebuilding militant capabilities.

Hezbollah has warned it will \u201cresort to alternatives\u201d and won't disarm if Israeli airstrikes persist and Lebanon\u2019s government doesn't act.",

One person was reported killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded in the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipropetrovsk region, which was hit for the third consecutive night. The attacks came hours after Russia claimed to have regained control over the remaining parts of the Kursk region, which Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last August.

      "description": "Republican members of Congress have gone to great lengths to avoid public meetings with their constituents over their two-week Easter recess. Nationwide, Republicans hosted only a handful of in-person town halls during the congressional break. The most vulnerable House Republicans were especially shielded from public view. Some didn't answer their office phones for days. None of them, a collection of swing-district conservatives from across states like Colorado, California, Iowa and Pennsylvania, hosted in-person events that were open to the public. Just one planned a telephone town hall. Others favored smaller invitation-only gatherings with local officials promoted only after they were over.",

Many older investors are taking the advice of experts to fine-tune investments if necessary but avoid dramatic moves that would cement losses. It's hard for someone of any age to watch their account drop in value, but it can be especially tough on older people. Financial planner Tj Binkowski of Nashville, Tennessee, says that when you're retired, paper losses aren't just on paper anymore.",

      "description": "People with diseases caused by rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than other patients despite rapid recent advancements in the growing field of genetic science. In cystic fibrosis, for example, medications can vastly improve health for 90% of people with the condition, which is the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S. But the therapies don't work for the 10% of patients with rare mutations. Experts say one big reason for this dynamic is that it's less profitable to develop therapies for smaller numbers of people. With help from charities, however, scientists are working on gene therapies that can help all patients, regardless of mutation.",

Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Trump has been mostly focusing on the wrong priorities as to say he's been focusing on the right ones. The findings suggest Democrats are even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in.
