      "description": "President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are showing no signs of reconciling on Friday, but Republicans are increasingly urging them to settle their dispute. They know what's at stake \u2014 a massive tax and border spending bill from the Republican Party that Musk has been railing against for days. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says he hopes \u201cthat both of them come back together.\u201d Still, the feud between Trump and Musk is probably best described as a moving target. One person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking says Musk wants to speak with Trump, but that the president doesn\u2019t want to do it \u2014 or at least, not on Friday.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to pause a court order to reinstate Education Department employees who were fired in mass layoffs as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the agency. The Justice Department\u2019s emergency appeal to the high court Friday said U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston exceeded his authority last month when he issued a preliminary injunction reversing the layoffs of nearly 1,400 people and putting the broader plan on hold. Joun\u2019s order has blocked one of Trump\u2019s biggest campaign promises and effectively stalled the effort to wind down the department. A federal appeals court refused to put the order on hold while the administration appealed.",

Tens of thousands of people attended the commemorations, which included parachute jumps, flyovers, remembrance ceremonies, parades, and historical reenactments. The June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied France was unprecedented in scale and audacity, using the largest-ever armada of ships, troops, planes and vehicles to punch a hole in Hitler\u2019s defenses in western Europe. A total of 4,414 Allied troops were killed on D-Day itself.",
