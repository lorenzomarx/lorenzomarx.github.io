      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan says immigration enforcement will reduce the number of officers in Minnesota. Homan suggested during a news conference Thursday that a drawdown would happen only after \u2018cooperation\u2019 from state officials. Trump sent Homan to Minnesota in the wake of the Saturday fatal shooting of a protester at the hands of a federal immigration officer. Homan doubled down on the need for local jails to alert Immigration and Customs Enforcement to people in their custody who ICE can remove from the country.",

      "description": "Senate Democrats are poised to block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies on Thursday. That would bring the government a step closer to a partial shutdown if Republicans and the White House do not agree to new restrictions on President Donald Trump\u2019s surge of immigration enforcement. As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest.",

Kaja Kallas said that she expects foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday to agree on adding Iran\u2019s Guard to its terrorist list. She said the move would put the Guard on the same footing as al-Qaida, Hamas and the Islamic State group. Iran had no immediate comment, but it has been criticizing Europe in recent days as it considered the move, which follows the U.S. earlier sanctioning the Guard.",

Officials say it could be days before power is restored across the South and more subfreezing temperatures are expected by Friday. The growing misery and anxiety comes amid what Mississippi officials say is the state\u2019s worst winter storm in more than 30 years. Roughly 298,000 homes and businesses remained without power Wednesday night. The vast majority of them are in Tennessee and Mississippi, where many are unaccustomed to and ill-equipped for freeing temperatures. At least 70 people have died across the U.S. in states afflicted by the dangerous cold.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is looking at basing the new Board of Peace in the Washington building that formerly housed the U.S. Institute of Peace. That word comes from four administration officials. The Board of Peace's initial task is to oversee President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza ceasefire plan, but he seems to have broader ambitions for the initiative. The U.S. Institute of Peace is an independent nongovernmental organization established by Congress. The administration seized the building last year and fired almost all the institute's staff. The building has since been renamed the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace, but its name and status are in legal limbo.",

      "description": "Donald Trump lost his bid for reelection in 2020. But for more than five years, he\u2019s been trying to convince Americans the opposite is true by falsely saying the election was marred by widespread fraud. Now that he\u2019s president again, Trump is pushing the federal government to back up those bogus claims. On Wednesday, the FBI served a search warrant at the election headquarters of Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta, seeking ballots from the 2020 election. It marks an escalation of Trump's obsession with the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and some observers say his administration is using Georgia as a blueprint for challenging results this November.",
