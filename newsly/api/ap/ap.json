      "description": "Israeli airstrikes across Gaza have killed at least 17 people including children as the new U.S. ambassador to Israel made his first public appearance in Jerusalem. Gaza hospitals say among the dead early Friday were 10 people in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, including eight from the same house. The strikes come a day after more than two dozen people died in Gaza as Israel ramps up attacks to pressure Hamas to return the hostages and disarm. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee appeared at the Western Wall, the holiest Jewish prayer site in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, where he inserted a prayer handwritten by President Donald Trump.",

The strikes were confirmed by the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which did not acknowledge any casualties. The airstrikes represent one of the highest death tolls so far in the campaign launched under President Donald Trump that has involved hundreds of strikes since March 15. Central Command said U.S. forces acted to eliminate fuel for the Houthis and deprive them of illegal revenue.",

By early Friday, memorials of candles and flowers dotted the campus and a school-wide vigil had been scheduled as students and faculty tried to start healing from the shooting that investigators said killed two men and wounded at least six others. Investigators say the son of a sheriff\u2019s deputy opened fire with his mother\u2019s former service weapon. Officers who arrived almost immediately shot and wounded the shooter who is believed to be a Florida State student.",

      "description": "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals. The mine in California can\u2019t meet the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is pushing for new mines. Rare earth elements are ingredients in electric vehicles, advanced fighter jets, smartphones and many other products. They aren\u2019t actually rare, but it\u2019s hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment. Experts say prices are likely to increase quickly if China extends its import controls but there is likely enough of a stockpile to keep factories operating for now.",

On the American side, billionaire real estate magnate Steve Witkoff leads the effort by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to restrict Tehran\u2019s atomic program, which they fear could allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon. Representing Iran is Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who like many of his generation is a veteran of the bloody Iran-Iraq war. He rose through the ranks of Iran\u2019s diplomatic corps and served as a trusted negotiator during talks that led to Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",

Currencies rise and fall all the time over inflation fears and other factors, but economists worry the dramatic dollar drop shows a loss of confidence in the U.S. as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade. If true, the blow could be big. The special status of the dollar as the medium of international trade and a safe haven has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at low rates even as debts have ballooned, which has helped speed economic growth.",

El Santuario de Chimay\u00f3 just north of Santa Fe is one of the most important Catholic pilgrimage centers in the U.S. It culminates Friday in displays of faith, reflection and repentance on backcountry highways. The church at Chimay\u00f3 is renowned for a tiny indoor well of holy dirt thought to have curative powers. The site also is significant because of the Nuestro Se\u00f1or de Esquipulas crucifix, which was found on the site in the early 1800s.",
