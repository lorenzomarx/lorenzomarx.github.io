Israeli officials say that the bodies belong to Ronen Engel and Sonthaya Oakkharasri. They were killed during Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel has threatened on Sunday to keep the Rafah border crossing closed until Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning all deceased hostages. Hamas has handed over the remains of 13 bodies. Eleven of them have been identified as hostages. Israel said one of the bodies released didn't belong to a hostage. The Palestinian group said that talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.",

      "description": "China has expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get approval for exporting products containing even small amounts of China-originated materials. This move mirrors the U.S.'s foreign direct product rule, which restricts China's access to certain U.S. technologies. Experts say China is adopting U.S. strategies in trade disputes. Since 2018, China has developed laws and policies to retaliate in trade conflicts, similar to U.S. practices. These include the Unreliable Entity List and the Anti-Foreign Sanction Law. While these tools help China counter U.S. actions, they also risk escalating tensions.",

The Trump administration has cut state grants and tied funding to immigration enforcement. And the government shutdown adds to the problem. Last week, a federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop linking grants to immigration enforcement. Some states have seen drastic cuts to homeland security grants, leading to a freeze on the entire $1 billion program. Emergency management agencies are delaying hiring and equipment purchases. Experts warn these disruptions could jeopardize preparedness and response to disasters.",
