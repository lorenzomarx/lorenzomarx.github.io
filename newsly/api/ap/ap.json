      "description": "Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s ability to carry out President Donald Trump's \u201cplay call\u201d for funding the government is being put to the test. The House is holding a procedural vote Tuesday on a bill that would end the partial government shutdown. Johnson will need near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed. The legislation funds most of the federal government through Sept. 30 and the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks as lawmakers negotiate potential changes for the agency that enforces the nation\u2019s immigration laws, often referred to as ICE. Trump urged lawmakers to back the bill in a social media post.",

The Speaker of the House of Lords says Mandelson will retire effective Wednesday. He faces a potential police investigation over claims he passed sensitive government information to Epstein. The British government sent police a file on Tuesday about Mandelson's alleged leaks. Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he's is appalled by the revelations in newly released Epstein files. The files suggest Mandelson shared market-sensitive information about the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party on Sunday to avoid further embarrassment.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to welcome Colombian President Gustavo Petro to the White House for talks. Tuesday's meeting comes weeks after Trump accused the Colombian leader of pumping cocaine into the United States and threatened military action against his South American country. U.S. administration officials say the meeting will focus on regional security cooperation and counternarcotics efforts. Bad blood between the leaders looms large ahead of the sit-down. Trump, on the heels of an operation to capture Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, warned Petro last month that he could be next. The conservative Trump and leftist Petro are ideologically far apart, but both leaders share a tendency for verbal bombast and unpredictability. That's giving the visit an anything-could-happen vibe.",

On the Egyptian side, Palestinians who fled earlier in the Israel-Hamas war await return. On the Gaza side, those needing medical treatment unavailable in Gaza hope to cross. The crossing's reopening is seen as a step forward in the fragile ceasefire, but only a small number have crossed so far. Health officials emphasize the urgent need for medical supplies and evacuations. The situation remains tense with ongoing security and bureaucratic challenges.",

The strikes reported Tuesday came a day before U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi. Zelenskyy said that Russia targeted the power grid again in five regions of Ukraine in a bid to deny civilians light, heating and water during a harsh winter. At least 10 people were wounded. Zelenskyy urged allies to send more air defense supplies and increase pressure on Russia. Talks between Moscow and Kyiv have been described as constructive.
