The meeting between the two countries\u2019 top diplomats in Riyadh on Tuesday would be their most significant since the Russia invaded its neighbor almost three years ago, and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

      "description": "European leaders are seeking to form a united front at emergency talks in Paris, called after a U.S. diplomatic blitz on Ukraine which has thrown a once-solid alliance into turmoil and left the Europeans questioning the reliability of their key transatlantic partner. Shortly before the meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump, but Macron\u2019s office would not disclose details about the 20-minute discussion. European leaders have been stunned by a weeklong diplomatic blitz on Ukraine from the Trump administration that seemed to embrace the Kremlin while it cold-shouldered many of its age-old European allies. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, underlined Monday that Europe has no place at the negotiating table.",

But they now fear it could come on unfavorable terms. Top U.S. and Russian officials plan to meet Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to discuss an end to the war. Kyiv won't participate. That rankles some Ukrainians who worry they will be sidelined. While Ukraine will not take part in Tuesday\u2019s talks, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said any actual peace negotiations would only take place with Ukraine\u2019s involvement.",

U.S. President Donald Trump last week suggested he would be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, long has been floated as a possible site for peace talks as well given the large population of Russian and Ukrainian expatriates who have flooded the country since the war began, and due to the Emirates\u2019 work on prisoner exchanges in the past.
