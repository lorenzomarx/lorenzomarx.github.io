      "description": "House lawmakers tried to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, but the former girlfriend and confidant of Jeffrey Epstein invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be incriminating. An attorney for Maxwell also told lawmakers that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she would be willing to testify that neither Trump nor former President Bill Clinton were culpable for wrongdoing in their relationships with Epstein, according to both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who exited the closed-door meeting. The House Oversight Committee had wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she\u2019s serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking",

      "description": "Buckingham Palace says King Charles III will \u201csupport\u2019\u2019 UK police assessing reports that the former Prince Andrew gave confidential information to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The statement came after police said they were examining reports that the former prince, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, sent trade reports to Epstein in 2010. Thames Valley Police, which serves areas west of London, including the ex-royal\u2019s former home in Windsor, launched the inquiry after news organizations reported on emails that suggest the then-prince sent Epstein reports from a 2010 tour of Southeast Asia he took as Britain\u2019s envoy for international trade.",

Opening arguments for the first, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, begin this week. Instagram parent company Meta and Google\u2019s YouTube will face claims that their platforms deliberately addict and harm children. TikTok and Snap, which were originally named in the lawsuit, settled for undisclosed sums. This case marks the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms.",

Not in recent U.S. memory has an American policing operation so consistently masked its officers from the public. Whether to allow \u2014 or ban \u2014 the masks has emerged as a central question as Congress debates over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats want to ban masks as one of several proposals to rein in immigration operations. But many Republicans support the masks. The Department of Homeland Security believes the masks are important to safeguard employees from online harassment. Lawmakers face a Friday midnight funding deadline to avoid a partial agency shutdown.",

The number of people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention has topped 70,000 for the first time. The agency said there were 7,252 people in custody at least six months in mid-January, including 79 held for more than two years. That\u2019s more than double the 2,849 who were in ICE custody at least six months in December 2024, the last full month of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",

The tentative agreement announced Monday involves Montefiore and Mount Sinai hospital systems. Nurses remain on strike at NewYork Presbyterian. The walkout began Jan. 12. The hospitals scrambled to hire legions of temporary nurses to fill in during a demanding flu season. Mount Sinai alone hired 1,400 temporary nurses. The three-year deal, which still needs to be approved by union members, affects roughly 10,500 of the some 15,000 nurses on strike at some of the city\u2019s biggest private, nonprofit hospitals.",
