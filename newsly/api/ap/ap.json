      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country wants \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d before any talks to end the Ukraine-Russia war. Zelenskyy made his remarks Friday during a highly anticipated meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference. Shortly before sitting down with Vance, Zelenskyy said he will only agree to meet in-person with Russian leader Vladimir Putin after a common plan is negotiated with U.S. President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy said he believes Trump is the key to ending the war, and said the U.S president gave him his telephone number.",

      "description": "Russian media say a U.S. citizen was detained after cannabis-laced marmalade was found in his luggage. The arrest comes days after a Moscow-Washington prisoner swap that the White House called a diplomatic thaw and a step toward ending the fighting in Ukraine. Russian police said the 28-year-old American had attempted to smuggle a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of drugs into the country. The Interfax news agency said he was detained at Moscow\u2019s Vnukovo airport after flying in from Istanbul last Friday. Mash, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, said the U.S. citizen, identified only as K. Byers, faced up to seven years in prison if convicted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department.",

      "description": "A drone armed with a warhead hit the protective outer shell of Ukraine\u2019s Chernobyl nuclear plant. Friday's strike punched a hole in the shell and briefly started a fire. Kyiv blamed Russia, while the Kremlin denied it was responsible. The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency said radiation levels at the shuttered plant in the Kyiv region have not increased. It said the strike did not breach the plant\u2019s inner containment shell. The IAEA did not attribute blame. Fighting around nuclear power plants has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war. Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986.",

Speaking on state radio Friday, Orb\u00e1n praised Trump\u2019s efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine and criticized the European Union's stance on sanctions. A recent Trump-Putin call raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe about a settlement without their involvement. Orb\u00e1n, a longtime critic of EU sanctions, warned high energy prices could lead to the bloc\u2019s collapse. He described Trump\u2019s influence as a \u201cTrump tornado,\u201d reshaping Western policies. Hungary remains heavily reliant on Russian energy, diverging from most European nations.",

Court documents published Friday show the three men were deported the day after a federal judge approved a temporary order blocking a possible transfer to Guantanamo.

The three men were abducted from one of the hardest-hit communities in southern Israel during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that ignited the war. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel is to release more than 300 Palestinian prisoners held in its jails in return. Of the 251 hostages taken, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead.",
