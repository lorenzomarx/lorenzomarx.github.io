      "description": "Officials in Kansas and Texas are evaluating damage from overnight tornadoes just days after storms killed more than two dozen people in communities in Kentucky and Missouri. The National Weather Service says meteorologists predicted days of dangerous weather conditions across the central U.S. with heavy rains, thunderstorms and potential tornadoes. Officials in Reno County, Kansas, say a powerful tornado tore through late Sunday and damaged several homes, trees and utility poles. Officials say damage was extensive, but no injuries or deaths were reported. An official in Palo Pinto County, Texas, says they're evaluating damage there on Monday morning.",

The court\u2019s order Monday, with only one noted dissent, puts on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept in place Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans that would have otherwise expired last month. The status allows people already in the United States to live and work legally because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife.",

Israel on Sunday said it would resume aid deliveries into the war-battered territory after a complete halt on imports since early March.",

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone. His office said Sunday this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, but the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.",

He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers say prosecutors are showing proof of domestic violence, but not the federal crimes with which he's charged.",

But the latest economic reports don\u2019t match the doom and gloom. Inflation actually eased last month, and hiring was solid in April. For now, the disconnect has businesses and consumers struggling to reconcile what they were told to expect, what the numbers say and what they are seeing on the ground. So is it time to breathe easy? Not yet, economists say. Trump\u2019s tariffs are still huge, unpredictable and working their way through the system.",

Trump expressed his hopes for a \u201cproductive day\u201d Monday \u2014 and a ceasefire \u2014 in a social media post over the weekend. His effort will also include calls to NATO leaders. Trump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022. That makes these conversations a serious test of his reputation as a dealmaker after having claimed he'd quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, or even before he took office.",
