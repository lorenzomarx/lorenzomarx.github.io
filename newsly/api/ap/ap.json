      "description": "Crews have pushed through mountainous wilderness in California near Lake Tahoe during a snowstorm to rescue six backcountry skiers who survived an avalanche but were trapped by its snow and ice. Nine others from their tour group remain missing. The Nevada County Sheriff's Office says two of the six were taken to a hospital for treatment. The sheriff\u2019s office says there were 15 skiers on the trip \u2014 not 16 as initially believed. Extreme weather conditions in the Northern California mountains slowed the rescue effort. It took crews several hours to reach the skiers and take them to safety, where they were evaluated by the Truckee Fire Department.",

      "description": "Les Wexner\u2019s long-time friendship with the late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein will be the subject of a closed-door congressional deposition in Ohio. The billionaire retail magnate on Wednesday is expected to face questions about new revelations contained in Epstein-related documents released by the Justice Department. The 88-year-old Wexner is the retired founder of L Brands. He says he intends to cooperate with House Oversight Committee members' inquiry. As one of Epstein\u2019s most prominent former friends, Wexner has already spent years answering for their association. He denies any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein\u2019s crimes. Wexner's name appears more than 1,000 times.",

Prosecutor Laurence Beccuau says one case covers sex abuse crimes and the other covers financial wrongdoing. She says investigators want to use newly released U.S. files, media reports, and fresh complaints to build a broader picture. She called on Wednesday on people who may never have spoken up before to file formal complaints or give witness accounts. She also says older French files will get reviewed.",

      "description": "The former Ukrainian army general widely seen as the top political rival to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken publicly for the first time about a deep rift between the two men. The comments made by Valerii Zaluzhnyi during an interview with the AP signal his possible desire to run for the presidency after the war is over. Zelenskyy ousted Zaluzhnyi as head of the army in 2024 and later appointed him as the country\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Zaluzhnyi told AP that their strained relationship reached a boiling point in 2022, when domestic intelligence agents raided his office, a previously unreported incident he alleges was an act of intimidation. Zelenskyy's office and the country's security service declined to comment. The AP could not confirm Zaluzhnyi's account of the raid.",

Democrats\u2019 favorability among the party\u2019s rank-and-file plummeted after the 2024 election. The latest measure of how Democrats view their party hasn't improved since then. The midterm elections are still many months away, and lackluster favorability doesn\u2019t spell electoral doom. Other factors could benefit Democrats this year, including broadly negative views of Trump and other Republicans. But the lack of enthusiasm could be a longer-term problem for the party.",

      "description": "Some Republican legislators are pushing to limit state environmental regulations. Alabama lawmakers approved legislation Tuesday limiting state agencies from adopting pollution rules stricter than federal standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. It follows efforts by the Trump administration to roll back rules at the agency. The Alabama measure would allow new state pollution limits only if there is a direct link between exposure and bodily harm. Supporters say the bill reduces regulatory burdens and aligns with President Donald Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda. Environmental groups and Democrats say the bill prioritizes industry over public health. The bill now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey.",

Jesse Jackson kept up his more than half-century-long fight for civil and human rights through his final years despite challenges over his health, the coronavirus pandemic, racial injustice and political divisions.
