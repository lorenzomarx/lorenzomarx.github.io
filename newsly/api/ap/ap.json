      "description": "Authorities say firefighters who rushed to put out a blaze in a northern Idaho mountain community found themselves instead in an unexpected shootout. A man who had intentionally set the fire to ambush the crew on Sunday was perched in a sniper position, firing at the firefighters on Canfield Mountain just north of Coeur d\u2019Alene. Authorities say they took cover behind firetrucks, but two died and a third was wounded during a barrage of gunfire over several hours. First responders made urgent calls for help. Authorities eventually found the suspect dead in the mountains. It is unknown how he died, and authorities have not yet revealed a motive.",

      "description": "The Senate will try to sprint ahead on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts after a weekend of setbacks. An all-night session to consider an endless stream of proposed amendments, called a vote-a-rama, was abruptly postponed. It's now scheduled to launch when the Senate gavels open Monday. With Democrats united against the Republican president's legislation, the voting could take all day. The day ahead could be pivotal for Republicans, who are racing to meet Trump's Fourth of July deadline to pass the bill. The House is being called back to session for votes as soon as Wednesday, if the Senate can pass the bill.",

The 61-year-old Bacon announced Monday that he would not seek a sixth term in the U.S. House. Bacon recently indicated he was considering retiring from public service, saying he wanted to spend more time with family.

The administration is threatening to cut all federal funding from the Ivy League school if it fails to take action. A federal task force sent a letter to Harvard on Monday finding the university violated civil rights laws requiring colleges to protect students from discrimination based on race or national origin. It says Harvard was at times a \u201cwillful participant in anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff\u201d and that campus leaders allowed antisemitism to fester on the Massachusetts campus. In a statement, Harvard said it strongly disagrees with the government findings and is committed to fighting bias.",
