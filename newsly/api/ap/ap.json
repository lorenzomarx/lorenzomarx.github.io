      "description": "TikTok says it will have to \u201cgo dark\u201d this weekend unless the outgoing Biden administration assures the company it won\u2019t enforce a shutdown of the popular app after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the federal law banning the app unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company. The court ruled Friday the risk to national security posed by TikTok's ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the U.S. The court\u2019s decision means new users won\u2019t be able to download the app and updates won\u2019t be available, but it won\u2019t disappear from users\u2019 phones.",

      "description": "TikTok arrived in the U.S. almost 6 1/2 years ago. The possibility the U.S. would outlaw the video-sharing app has kept influencers and users in anxious limbo for more than four of the years since then. Now, the moment its fans dreaded is here, but uncertainty over TikTok\u2019s future lingers. On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that bans the social media platform starting Sunday unless its China-based parent company sells to an approved buyer. An official says the Biden administration plans to leave the law\u2019s implementation to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Monday. During its short life, TikTok has been both a global cultural phenomenon and the subject of political wrangling.",

      "description": "President-elect Donald Trump says he \u201cmost likely\u201d will give TikTok 90 more days to work out a deal that would allow the popular video-sharing platform to avoid a U.S. ban. Trump said in an NBC News interview on Saturday that he hasn't decided what to do but was considering granting TikTok a reprieve after he is sworn into office on Monday. A law that prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from distributing TikTok to U.S. users takes effect on Sunday. The law gave TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company nine months to sell the platform\u2019s U.S. operation, but allows the sitting president to grant an extension if a sale is in progress.",

But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning that a ceasefire won't go forward unless Israel receives the names of hostages to be released, as had been agreed. Families of hostages held in Gaza are bracing Saturday for news of loved ones, while Palestinians prepare to receive freed detainees and humanitarian groups hurry to set up a surge in aid. The pending ceasefire has set off a flurry of activity and a fresh wave of emotions as relatives wonder if hostages will be returned alive or dead.",

The operation will be concentrated largely in the Chicago area. Arrests are expected throughout the week, subject to possible weather delays. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the operation has not been made public. Immigrants and groups advocating for them have been preparing since Trump won the presidency in November. Trump has often criticized Chicago for its protections for people in the country illegally.",

Yoon and his lawyers on Saturday appeared before the court\u2019s judge during a hearing and argued for his release.",
