Trump also said at the hotel ballroom event Thursday he'll name Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead a task force to \u201ceradicate anti-Christian bias.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump advocated at the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol for Americans to \u201cbring God back\u201d into their lives and said his relationship with religion \u201cchanged\u201d after a pair of failed assassination attempts last year. Trump joined a more than 70-year-old Washington tradition that brings together a bipartisan group of lawmakers for fellowship. The nondenominational Christian says he believes \u201cyou can\u2019t be happy without religion.\u201d",

      "description": "Vice President JD Vance recently cited medieval Catholic theology in justifying the immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. \u201cJust google \u2018ordo amoris,\u2019\u201d he posted Jan. 30 on the social media platform X. The concept has been translated as \u201corder of love\u201d or \u201corder of charity.\u201d The ancient St. Augustine said everyone and everything should be loved in its own proper way. \u201cBut since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who ... are brought into closer connection with you,\" Augustine wrote. The medieval St. Thomas Aquinas echoed this theme but added sometimes one must help a stranger in greater need than a family member.",

At double the width of our Milky Way Galaxy, this jet of radio waves is the biggest ever detected in the early universe. Astronomers announced the discovery Thursday. They say radio jets like this are not uncommon in our cosmic neighborhood, but elusive in the distant early universe. The double-sided radio wave is estimated to be at least 200,000 light-years across. Quasars are among the universe's brightest objects.",

      "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio may have hoped to spend his first trip abroad focused exclusively on issues close to his heart: immigration, counternarcotics and curbing Chinese influence in the Western Hemisphere. Instead, the five-nation tour to Central America was overshadowed by a massive Washington-centered upheaval in U.S. foreign policy. Just two weeks into his job as President Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat, the Miami-born former Florida senator did stay true to his original intent in meetings with the leaders of Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. But the dismantlement of the U.S. Agency for International Development and Trump\u2019s surprise proposal for a U.S. takeover of the Gaza Strip dominated his public engagements.",

U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. in Boston sided with several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan orchestrated by Trump adviser Elon Musk. The Republican president is trying to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. The judge didn't express an opinion on the legality of the program.

It\u2019s happened with his attempts to freeze funding, undermine birthright citizenship and push out government workers. Now the question is whether the court rulings are a mere speed bump or a big roadblock for the Republican president, who is determined to expand the limits of his power \u2014 sometimes by simply ignoring the laws. Lawsuits could end up at the U.S. Supreme Court, where a conservative majority has demonstrated its willingness to overturn precedent.",
