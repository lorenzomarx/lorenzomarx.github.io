      "description": "Donald Trump has begun erasing Joe Biden\u2019s legacy after taking office as the nation\u2019s 47th president. He has pardoned nearly all of his supporters who rioted at the U.S. Capitol in 2021 and issued a blizzard of executive orders that signal his desire to remake American institutions. It's an aggressive start for a returning president who feels emboldened and vindicated by his unprecedented political comeback. Four years after being voted out of the White House, Trump has a second chance to launch what he called \u201ca golden era\u201d for the country. He signed orders for increasing border security, freezing new regulations and establishing a task force for reducing the size of the federal government. He also rescinded dozens of directives issued by Joe Biden.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or vowed to dismiss the cases of all of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump\u2019s action Monday paves the way for the release from prison of people found guilty of violent attacks on police, as well as leaders of far-right extremist groups convicted of failed plots to keep the Republican in power after he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden. The pardons are a culmination of Trump\u2019s yearslong campaign to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack that left more than 100 police officers injured.",

He has repealed dozens of former President Joe Biden\u2019s actions, begun his immigration crackdown, withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate accords and sought to keep TikTok open in the U.S., among other actions. He has pardoned hundreds of people for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He is easing regulatory burdens on oil and natural gas production, something he promises will bring down costs of all consumer goods. He is pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and has ordered a comprehensive review of foreign aid spending",

The Republican vowed to reverse changes made by the outgoing Democratic president, Joe Biden, offering a glimpse of several executive actions to chart a new course for America.

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration seemed normal, but there were concerns about U.S. democracy lingering just beneath the surface. Trump himself made those apparent when he followed his speech that urged unity and optimism with one to supporters vowing to pardon Jan. 6 rioters \u2014 and then later he did just that. Trump has also promised to seek revenge against his political opponents. That pledge led to a blitz of last-minute preemptive pardons issued by outgoing President Joe Biden. The ceremony was moved inside the U.S. Capitol due to cold weather. That meant it took place in the very halls Trump supporters stormed on Jan. 6, 2021, as they acted on Trump's election lies and sought to stop Biden from taking office.",

In the streets of the capital, some Panamanians on Monday saw it as Trump\u2019s way of applying pressure on Panama for something else he wants: better control of migration through the Darien Gap. Others recalled the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama with concern. Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino responded forcefully, saying that the canal belongs to his country of 4 million and will remain Panama\u2019s territory.",

It's the first measure that President Donald Trump likely will sign into law and gives more weight to his plans to deport millions of migrants. Trump has made a broad crackdown on illegal immigration his top priority. And Congress, with Republicans in control and some Democrats willing to go along, is showing it's ready to follow suit. The Laken Riley Act is named after a Georgia nursing student whose murder by a Venezuelan man last year became a rallying cry for Trump\u2019s White House campaign.",
