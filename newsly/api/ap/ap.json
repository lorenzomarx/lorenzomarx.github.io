      "description": "Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development have been instructed to stay out of its Washington headquarters after billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency. That's according to a notice distributed to the staffers early Monday. USAID staffers say they tracked 600 employees who reported being locked out of the agency\u2019s computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying \u201cat the direction of Agency leadership\u201d the headquarters building \u201cwill be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.\u201d The developments come after Musk said he'd spoken with Trump about the U.S. aid and development agency and the Republican president agreed they should shut it.",

The S&P 500 sank 1.4% in early Monday trading following similar losses for markets across Asia and Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 435 points, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.8%. Everything from bitcoin to the Mexican peso fell, not just stocks of the U.S. companies expected to be the first to feel pain from tariffs on goods imported from Canada, Mexico and China. Some of the sharpest losses hit Big Tech and stocks that would be hurt most by higher interest rates and the worse inflation that could result from tariffs. Oil rose.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken executive action to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico. The move fulfills campaign promises but also sparked retaliatory moves that could signal an extended trade war with key trading partners and, in the case of Mexico and Canada, the closest U.S. neighbors and allies. Unlike during the 2024 campaign, when Trump billed his economic agenda as a sure-fire way to reduce the cost of living for American workers, the president now is acknowledging what many economists have long forecasted: the levies could yield higher prices and lower supplies across the market.",

      "description": "Hundreds of internal emails show executives of the New Orleans Saints were far more involved than previously known in providing public relations help to Catholic church leaders as they confronted a clergy sex abuse crisis. The emails sharply undercut assurances the Saints provided five years ago when they asserted they had provided only \u201cminimal\u201d assistance to the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Survivors of clergy abuse say they're disgusted by the team's involvement. The Saints said in a statement Friday that the team does not condone sex abuse. They also criticized the media for using leaked emails to misconstrue what they called \u201ca well-intended effort.\u201d",

Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers says portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for further investigation. Crews are expected to begin the work of lifting the wreckage on Monday and at daybreak they could be seen aboard a vessel with a crane.

      "description": "President Donald Trump says Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. He's also claiming that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States. The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort are causing a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty. And they're threatening to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year\u2019s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. The tariffs are set to launch on Tuesday.",

The former official says members of Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 known as DOGE \u2014 eventually did gain access Saturday to the agency\u2019s classified information, which includes intelligence reports.",
