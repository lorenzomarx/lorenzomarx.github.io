      "description": "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in its first case stemming from the flurry of actions marking the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Before the court Thursday are the Trump administration\u2019s emergency appeals of lower court orders putting nationwide holds on the Republican president\u2019s push to deny citizenship to children born to people who are in the U.S. illegally. Birthright citizenship is among several issues the administration has urgently asked the court to deal with, after lower courts acted to slow Trump\u2019s agenda. The administration, like the Biden administration before it, complains judges are overreaching by issuing nationwide injunctions that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.",

      "description": "Defense officials say military commanders will be told to identify troops in their units who are transgender or have gender dysphoria, then send them to medical checks in order to force them out of the service. A senior defense official laid out Thursday what could be a complicated and lengthy new process aimed at fulfilling President Donald Trump\u2019s directive to remove all transgender service members from the U.S. military. The new order to commanders relies on routine annual health checks that service members are required to undergo. It scraps, for now, plans to go through troops\u2019 health records to identify those with gender dysphoria. Instead, transgender troops who don\u2019t voluntarily come forward could be outed by commanders or others.",

      "description": "A hospital in southern Gaza says 54 people have been killed in overnight airstrikes on the city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press cameraman counted 10 airstrikes on the city overnight into Thursday and saw numerous bodies taken to the morgue in Nasser Hospital. Some bodies arrived in pieces, with some body bags containing the remains of multiple people. The hospital\u2019s morgue confirmed 54 people had been killed. The strikes come as U.S. President Donald Trump visits the Middle East, visiting Gulf states but not Israel. There had been hope that Trump\u2019s regional visit could usher in a ceasefire or renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza. An Israeli blockade of the territory is now in its third month.",

Her family says it should have the option to stop the life-support devices but that they've been told state law removes that choice. Georgia bars abortion in most cases after cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks into pregnancy. One expert says whether states can force measures to preserve the life of a fetus are murky in the aftermath of the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state abortion bans.",

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan entered the plea during an arraignment Thursday in federal court. She and her lawyers left after the brief hearing without talking to reporters. Dugan is charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. According to an FBI affidavit, Dugan showed a man out the back door of her courtroom last month after learning immigration agents were in the courthouse looking to arrest him for being in the country illegally. The case has escalated a clash between Trump administration and Democrats over the president\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown.",

Investigators focused on 87 autopsies performed during the tenure of Dr. David Fowler. Fowler testified for the defense at the 2021 murder trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin.
