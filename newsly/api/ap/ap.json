      "description": "Crews are using backhoes and their bare hands to dig through piles of debris that stretch for miles in the search for more than 160 people believed to be missing in the flash floods that laid waste to Texas Hill Country. Over 100 bodies have been recovered so far, but the large number of missing suggested that the full extent of the catastrophe was still unclear five days after the disaster. Gov. Greg Abbott says the efforts will not stop until every missing person is accounted for. Officials have been seeking more information about those who were in the popular tourist destination during the Fourth of July holiday weekend.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has sent out tariff letters to seven smaller U.S. trading partners in his first batch of import tax announcements of the day. The countries targeted so far Wednesday are the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka. None of them is a major industrial rival to the United States. He says a letter is also coming for Brazil. Most economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth. But Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies.",

Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor's lawyers say O'Connor invoked doctor-client privilege and his rights under the Fifth Amendment before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. Republicans are investigating Biden\u2019s actions in office and questioning whether the Democrat's use of an autopen may have been invalid.

      "description": "The Trump administration has resumed sending some weapons to Ukraine, a week after the Pentagon had directed that some deliveries be paused. The weapons now moving into Ukraine include 155 mm munitions and precision-guided rockets known as GMLRS, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear exactly when the weapons started moving. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the pause last week to allow the Pentagon to assess its weapons stockpiles, in a move that caught the White House by surprise. The Pentagon has denied that Hegseth acted without consulting President Donald Trump. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly.",
