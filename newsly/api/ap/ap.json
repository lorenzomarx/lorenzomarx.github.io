      "description": "Palestinian health officials say Israeli strikes overnight and into Sunday killed 10 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children. Two of the strikes hit tents in the southern city of Khan Younis, each killing two children and their parents. Other strikes killed a child and a man riding a bicycle, according to Nasser Hospital, which received bodies from all the strikes. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths in the 19-month-old war because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the latest strikes.",

Residents and officials in the disputed Kashmir region say there was overnight fighting between Pakistani and Indian troops, despite a ceasefire, but the clashes subsided by Sunday morning. As part of the ceasefire announced a day earlier, the nuclear-armed neighbors agreed to immediately stop all military action on land, in the air and at sea. They accused each other of repeatedly violating the deal hours later. The recent escalation in violence followed a gun massacre of tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir and is the most serious military confrontation between them in decades.",
