      "description": "The Trump administration and billionaire ally Elon Musk have moved to shutter an agency that provides crucial aid to fund education and fight starvation overseas, sparking a showdown with congressional Democrats who blasted the effort as illegal and vowed a court fight. Officers prevented staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development and lawmakers the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters. Trump says shutting down USAID \u201cshould have been done a long time ago.\u201d The lawmakers, who appeared outside the USAID building before they were denied entrance, gave the most forceful response against Trump since the Republican took office last month.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs sent Wall Street on a roller coaster. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% Monday following sharper loses across Asia and Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.2%. U.S. stocks had initially been on track for much worse losses on worries about how much pain U.S. companies would feel because of the U.S. tariffs announced for imports from Canada, Mexico and China. The S&P 500 was briefly down nearly 2%, and the Dow dropped as many as 665 points. But they pared losses after Mexico\u2019s president said she had negotiated a one-month reprieve for her country. After the U.S. stock market closed for the day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a conversation he had with Trump also led to a 30-day pause.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken executive action to impose or threaten new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. The moves fulfill certain campaign promises but also have roiled stock markets and supply chains, while testing relations with the country\u2019s North American neighbors and, in China\u2019s case, the world\u2019s second-largest economy. But Trump is also declaring initial victories as Mexican and Canadian leaders agreed to more cooperation on border control. Unlike during the 2024 campaign, when Trump billed his economic agenda as guaranteed to reduce the cost of living for Americans, the Republican president now is acknowledging what many economists have long forecasted: that his approach could yield higher prices and lower supplies across a roiled U.S. market.",

      "description": "Hundreds of internal emails show executives of the New Orleans Saints were far more involved than previously known in providing public relations help to Catholic Church leaders as they confronted a clergy sex abuse crisis. The emails sharply undercut assurances the Saints provided five years ago when they asserted they had provided only \u201cminimal\u201d assistance to the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Survivors of clergy abuse say they're disgusted by the team's involvement. The Saints said in a statement Saturday that the team does not condone sex abuse. They also criticized the media for using leaked emails to misconstrue what they called \u201ca well-intended effort.\u201d",

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a closed-door meeting with diplomats last week that the U.S. will be hurt by a lack of access to critical information about global disease outbreaks. Internal materials obtained by The Associated Press show countries pressed WHO about how it might cope with the exit of its biggest donor. A confidential budget document showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash and that emergency operations in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan would be the most affected.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. He's also claiming that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States. The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort are causing a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty. And they're threatening to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year\u2019s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. The tariffs are set to launch on Tuesday.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China is aimed at stopping the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Chinese and Mexican officials say the opioid crisis is largely a U.S. problem because that's where the demand is. Ingredients for fentanyl are produced in China and used by pharmaceutical companies to make legal painkillers, but a portion of those chemicals is purchased by the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels in Mexico for the manufacture of illicit drugs. The cartels make fentanyl in labs and then smuggle the drug into the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona.",
