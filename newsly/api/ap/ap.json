      "description": "Cardinals are returning to the Sistine Chapel to continue voting for a new pope. The first conclave ballot failed to find a winner, sending black smoke through the chapel chimney. Some cardinals expected a short conclave to replace Pope Francis, but it may take a few rounds of voting for one man to secure the two-thirds majority needed. The secretive ritual began Wednesday with Cardinal Pietro Parolin leading the proceedings. Thousands gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square to watch the event on video screens. The cardinals are sequestered from the outside world until they find a new pope.",

The emergency appeal filed Thursday asks the justices to halt a lower-court order keeping in place legal protections for more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Republican administration argues the decision wrongly intrudes on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s authority.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says the plan calls for six new air traffic control centers, along with technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation\u2019s air traffic facilities over the next three years. How much it will all cost wasn\u2019t immediately revealed. Officials want to add fiber, wireless and satellite technology at more than 4,600 locations, replace 600 radars and increase the number of airports with systems designed to reduce near misses on runways.",

      "description": "New experiments show eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side. It\u2019s commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends because the arc-shaped bottom redirects the force of the impact and softens the blow. But when scientists ran simulations and dropped nearly 200 eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights, eggs broke less when they landed on their side. Scientists discovered that the egg\u2019s equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The new research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
