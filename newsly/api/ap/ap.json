      "description": "A massive search is stretching into its second day for a man who authorities say posed as a police officer and fatally shot a Democratic state lawmaker in her suburban Minneapolis home. Authorities say the suspect also shot and wounded a second lawmaker. Authorities have identified him as 57-year-old Vance Boelter. Melissa Hortman, a former Minnesota House Speaker, and her husband were fatally shot early Saturday in their Brooklyn Park home. The second state lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife were shot multiple times in nearby Champlin. Gov. Tim Walz has called it \u201ca politically motivated assassination.\u201d The FBI has issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to Boelter's arrest and conviction.",

      "description": "Melissa Hortman\u2019s power as a Democratic leader to shape the course of a deeply divided Minnesota Legislature was a far cry from her job as a teenager making chili-cheese burritos and overshadowed her volunteer work training service dogs for veterans. The 55-year-old was a lifelong Minneapolis-area resident who went to college in Boston and then returned home for law school. She was elected to the Minnesota House in 2004 and helped pass a sweeping liberal program as its speaker in 2023. The chamber was split evenly between Democrats and Republicans this year and she helped break a budget impasse. Friends and colleagues remembered her as grounded, kind and compassionate.",

      "description": "The attacks on two Democratic Minnesota state lawmakers at home are the latest in a grim and alarming spike in political violence. One lawmaker and her husband were killed while a second one and his wife were gravely wounded. Those attacks follow the firebombing of a march in Colorado calling for the release of hostages in Gaza, the killing of two Israeli embassy workers in Washington, D.C., and the firebombing of the Pennsylvania governor's mansion. And that's just in the past two months. Before that came the attempted assassination of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, the attack on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband and a shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice.",

Planned talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which could provide an off-ramp, were called off. The region braced for a protracted conflict after Israel\u2019s surprise bombardment of Iran\u2019s nuclear and military sites on Friday killed several top generals and nuclear scientists, and neither side showed any sign of backing down. Israel reportedly targeted a gas installation, raising the prospect of a broader assault on Iran\u2019s heavily-sanctioned energy industry that could affect global markets.",

While the requests may seem technical and mundane, collectively they suggest the department is moving away from its traditional stance of protecting access to the ballot box. Instead, the actions address concerns that have been raised by a host of conservative activists following years of false claims surrounding elections in the U.S. By targeting certain states \u2014 presidential battlegrounds or those controlled by Democrats \u2014 they also could be foreshadowing an expanded role for the department in future elections.",

Many people believe that the proliferation of apartments rented for days to tourists reduces the supply of housing for residents while driving up prices. Anger is growing, and spreading: anti-tourism protests are being planned on Sunday across Spain, Portugal and Italy. In Spain, authorities are trying their best to placate residents while protecting an industry that provides 12% of its economic growth. Barcelona has pledged to close all of the city's 10,000 tourist apartments by 2028 and national authorities are cracking down on Airbnb.",
