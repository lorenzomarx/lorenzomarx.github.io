      "description": "President Donald Trump has started imposing higher import taxes on goods from over 60 countries, including the European Union, Japan and South Korea. These tariffs, which began Thursday, are part of Trump's strategy to reduce the trade deficit and encourage foreign investment in the U.S. However, the economic impact is already visible, with signs of stalled hiring, rising inflation and declining home values. Despite the uncertainty, Trump remains optimistic about economic growth, while many experts warn of potential long-term damage.",

Some shootings have been isolated incidents between service members. But others have been attacks on bases or mass-casualty events. A 2009 shooting at Ford Hood in Texas by an Army pyschiatrist left 13 people dead. It was the deadliest attack on a domestic military installation in U.S. history. Wednesday's shooting in Georgia occurred at Fort Stewart. Authorities said the shooter has been taken into custody. The conditions of the victims were not immediately released.",

That brings the combined tariffs imposed by the United States on India to 50%. The tariffs would go into effect 21 days after the signing of the order Wednesday, meaning that both India and Russia might have time to negotiate with the administration on the import taxes. Trump\u2019s move could reshape India\u2019s economic ambitions. Many American companies have seen India as an alternative to the Chinese manufacturing that Trump had hoped to diminish through the use of tariffs.",

The halt in federal funding has meant some of the world\u2019s most prominent researchers exploring everything from opioid addiction to how diseases like cancer progress are laying off young researchers and shelving years or even decades of research. Some research might be lost forever. The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country\u2019s top universities. It has taken a particular hard and aggressive line against Harvard, freezing funding after the university rejected a series of demands from a federal antisemitism task force.",

The indictment against Elias Rodriguez was unsealed Wednesday and includes nine counts, including hate crime resulting in death. It also could clear the way for the Justice Department to potentially seek the death penalty. Rodriguez is accused of killing Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim in May, reportedly shouting \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during his arrest. Prosecutors say Rodriguez planned the attack, flying from Chicago with a handgun. Witnesses described him pacing outside before opening fire. He allegedly confessed inside the museum afterward.",
