      "description": "Up all night, House Republicans voted pre-dawn to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cuts package. The House is now starting a round of debates ahead of a final vote expected later Thursday morning. GOP leaders worked almost around the clock trying to persuade skeptical holdouts. Trump worked the phones as Republicans race to send the bill to his desk by the Fourth of July deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson had recalled lawmakers to Washington, eager to seize on the momentum of the 887-page bill's passage the day before in the Senate. Some GOP lawmakers are criticizing the legislation as straying from the party's fiscal goals. Johnson expects votes later Thursday morning.",

      "description": "Republicans in Congress have muscled President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending bill to passage. At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. The House approved the bill on Thursday, the final step necessary to get the bill to Trump's desk by the GOP\u2019s self-imposed deadline of July 4th. The bill would make permanent many of the tax breaks passed in Trump's first term while also adding new ones, such as new tax deductions for tips, overtime, seniors and interest payments on auto loans.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump will be in Iowa to kick off a year of patriotic festivities leading up to next year's 250th anniversary of American independence. Organizers see the coming year of festivities, which start Thursday, as a way to help unite a polarized country and bridge partisan divides. But a recent Gallup poll showed the widest partisan split in patriotism in over two decades, with only about a third of Democrats saying they are proud to be American compared with about 9 in 10 Republicans. As a candidate, Trump proposed a \u201cGreat American State Fair\u201d in Iowa, but it will take place next year in Washington instead.",

The justices said Thursday they will review lower court-rulings in favor of transgender athletes in Idaho and West Virginia. The case highlights a broader national debate over transgender rights, with more than two dozen states enacting laws restricting transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports. Some of these laws have been blocked in court. The issue has become a focal point in legislative and legal battles over the inclusion of transgender individuals in public life.",

Madsen\u2019s career spanned more than 300 credits stretching back to the early 1980s, many in low budget films. But his most memorable screen moment may have been the sadistic torture of a captured police officer in 1992\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs.\u201d He would become a Tarantino regular, appearing in the \u201cKill Bill\u201d films and \u201cThe Hateful Eight.\u201d",
