      "description": "The Supreme Court has again cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip temporary legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants, pushing the total number of people who could be newly exposed to deportation to nearly 1 million. The justices on Friday lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The court has also allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.",

He had spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to slash federal spending. However, Musk fell far short of his targets and struggled in the unfamiliar environment of Washington. Thousands of people were laid off or pushed out of their jobs while litigation piled up. Musk plans to go back to running his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. He's also said he'll curtail political spending after becoming Trump's biggest donor in last year's presidential campaign.",
