      "description": "Officials say a nighttime Russian missile and drone barrage has killed at least 15 people and injured 116 others in Ukraine while they slept in their homes, with the main barrage centering on the capital Kyiv. The Kyiv City Military Administration says 14 people were killed and 99 others were injured in the capital as explosions echoed across the city for hours during the night. The bombardment demolished a nine-story residential building, destroying dozens of apartments. It was one of the deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in recent months and came as two rounds of direct peace talks have failed to make progress on ending the war, now in its fourth year.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s air campaign on Iran\u2019s capital appeared to broaden on the fourth day of an intensifying conflict as U.S. President Donald Trump posted an ominous message warning residents of the city to evacuate. Earlier, the Israeli military called for the some 330,000 residents of a neighborhood in the city center to evacuate. Israel says its sweeping assault on Iran\u2019s top military leaders, uranium enrichment sites and nuclear scientists, is necessary to prevent its longtime adversary from getting any closer to building an atomic weapon. The strikes have killed at least 224 people since Friday. Iran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel and more than 500 injured.",

Palestinian witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli forces had fired on the crowds. The military said it was looking into reports that its forces had fired toward the crowd, causing several casualties. It did not appear to be related to a new Israeli- and U.S.-supported aid delivery network that rolled out last month and has been marred by controversy and violence.",

      "description": "A federal jury in Colorado has found MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed a former employee for a leading voting equipment company. Jurors reached the verdict Monday for Lindell, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent election conspiracy theorists. He had called the employee for Dominion Voting Systems, Eric Coomer, a traitor. Lindell\u2019s online media platform also streamed an event where a conservative podcaster accused Coomer of helping rig the 2020 election. During the trial in Denver, Lindell denied making any statements he knew to be false about Coomer. Coomer said his career and life have been destroyed as a result of the statements. Coomer\u2019s lawyers said Lindell either knew the statements were lies, or conveyed them recklessly without knowing if they were true.",

Judge Arun Subramanian made the ruling on Monday, rejecting arguments by Combs' attorneys that it would disrupt the diversity of the jury to replace the Black man with a white juror. Subramanian had first announced late Friday that he was dismissing the juror, but multiple defense lawyers protested. The judge delayed dismissing the juror until Monday, when the trial entered its sixth week.",
