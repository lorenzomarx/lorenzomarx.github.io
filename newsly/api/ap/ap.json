      "description": "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is set to depart the Trump administration. That's according to two people familiar with the matter, which marks the first major staff shakeup of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, has also targeted Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda.",

      "description": "A federal judge has barred the Trump administration from deporting any Venezuelans from South Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. is the first judge to rule that the Alien Enemies Act cannot be used against people who the Republican administration claims are gang members invading the United States. In March, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the U.S. He said he had special powers to deport immigrants, identified by his administration as gang members, without the usual court proceedings.",

      "description": "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to strip temporary legal protections from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to being deported. The Justice Department asked the high court Thursday to put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept in place Temporary Protected Status that would have otherwise expired last month. A federal appeals court had earlier rejected the administration\u2019s request. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending TPS for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians.",

The Associated Press obtained the planning documents, which are dated April 29 and 30. They represent the Army\u2019s most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th birthday festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Trump has long wanted but is still being discussed. The slides don't include any price estimates. But it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars to put on an event of that size.",

The strike came after days of clashes between pro-Syrian government gunmen and fighters who belong to the Druze minority sect near the capital, Damascus. The clashes left dozens of people dead or wounded. The Israeli army said in a statement that fighter jets struck adjacent to the area of the Palace of President Hussein al-Sharaa in Damascus. It gave no further details. Pro-government Syrian media outlets said the strike hit close to the People\u2019s Palace on a hill overlooking the city.",

However, in a ministry statement it said one-sided tariffs of up to 145% imposed by President Donald Trump remain an obstacle and undermine trust. The statement reiterated China\u2019s stance that is open to talks, but also that Beijing is determined to fight if it must. The statement cited an unnamed ministry spokesperson as saying that Beijing had taken note of various statements by senior U.S. officials indicating a willingness to negotiate over tariffs. But it emphasized that China would regard overtures without a change in President Donald Trump\u2019s sharp tariff hikes as insincere.",

It\u2019s the second year in a row with a decrease. That reverses a troubling trend that\u2019s plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade. The officials say that while the decline is a good sign, the numbers of reported assaults are still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the report hasn\u2019t been publicly released.",
