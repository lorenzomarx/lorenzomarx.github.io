Hours after Trump lamented his breakup with Musk and said Thursday that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his former backer and adviser and Musk responded on social media, Trump escalated the feud by threatening to use the U.S. government to hurt Musk\u2019s bottom line. \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media network. \u201cI was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d",

The justices\u2019 decision Thursday affects lawsuits in 20 states and the District of Columbia where, until now, courts had set a higher bar when members of a majority group, including those who are white and heterosexual, sue for discrimination under federal law. The court ruled in an appeal from Marlean Ames, who's worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for years. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson says federal civil rights law draws no distinction between members of majority and minority groups.",

The travel ban issued Wednesday is a repeat of an order of his first administration that led to widespread confusion at airports. This version includes Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The Republican president\u2019s first travel ban was issued in 2017 and banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. After legal challenges, the order was retooled until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump has said the initial ban was aimed at protecting the country.",
