      "description": "President Donald Trump says 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada will start Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war. He announced the coming tariffs at the White House on Monday. He says the tariffs are to force the two U.S. neighbors to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. Trump provided a one-month delay in February as both countries promised concessions. But Trump said Monday that there was \u201cno room left for Mexico or for Canada\u201d to avoid the steep new tariffs. U.S. stock markets moved sharply lower after Trump\u2019s comments. Trump said he would also add on another 10% tariff on goods from China, on top of the initial 10% he put in place last month.",

Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \u201cCrypto Strategic Reserve\u201d that will include lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",

While royal officials did not provide details about the private talks Monday at the monarch\u2019s royal residence, the king and Trudeau were expected to discuss Trump\u2019s comments about making Canada the 51st state. Charles is the head of state in Canada, a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies. Britain\u2019s monarchs must remain politically neutral, but the Canada issue shows how delicate that balancing act can be.",

      "description": "Federal employees face a midnight deadline to comply with Elon Musk\u2019s second demand for reports on their recent accomplishments. The request has become a flashpoint within the government workforce. Musk and President Donald Trump have suggested that employees who don\u2019t comply could get fired. They\u2019ve also described the requirement \u2014 a list of five things that each person did last week \u2014 as an unobjectionable way to increase accountability within a sprawling bureaucracy. But for many workers, it\u2019s been a source of anxiety and confusion as the new administration tightens its grip on the federal government. Judging by instructions that have circulated in recent days, they\u2019ll face a standing request for lists of accomplishments every Monday.",

Appearing in a Lake County circuit courtroom, Robert E. Crimo III, withdrew his earlier not-guilty plea in the Highland Park shooting. The judge said with the plea change, there would be no trial or further motions on the case. Sentencing will come April 23, but Crimo is certain to spend life behind bars. He was charged with 21 counts of first-degree murder, and the maximum sentence for each count is natural life in prison.",

      "description": "When Donald Trump started the biggest trade war since the 1930s in his first term, his impulsive combination of threats and import taxes on U.S. trading partners created chaos, generated drama -- and drew criticism from mainstream economists who favor free trade. But it didn\u2019t do much damage to the U.S. economy. Or much good. The trade war sequel that Trump has said he\u2019s planned for his second term could likely be costlier. Trump seems to have grander ambitions and is operating in a far more treacherous economic environment, one in which his tariffs risk rekindling inflation.",
