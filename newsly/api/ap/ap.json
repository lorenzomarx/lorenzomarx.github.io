      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's joining some of his top economic advisers for negotiations at the White House over tariffs and trade with a top Japanese official who's traveling to Washington for the talks. The Republican president says in a post on his social media platform he'll attend the meeting Wednesday alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Trump recently announced a round of global tariffs but then quickly put them on hold for 90 days after the markets tanked. Japan's 24% across-the-board tariff is on hold. But a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. remain in place.",

      "description": "Japan recorded a trade deficit for the fiscal year that just ended but racked up a $63 billion surplus with the United States. The Finance Ministry reported Thursday that the deficit was 5.2 trillion yen, or $37 billion, for the fiscal year through March, the fourth straight year of red ink. Exports to the U.S. are a contentious issue for U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese negotiators are in Washington to argue their case against higher U.S. tariffs. Japan is a key longtime U.S. ally and major investor in the U.S., employing hundreds of thousands of Americans in the U.S.",

U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg said Wedneday that the administration must try to \u201cpurge\u201d itself of a contempt finding or he'll launch hearings and potentially refer the matter for prosecution. The move by Boasberg marks an escalation in a battle between the judicial and executives branches of government over a president\u2019s powers to carry out key White House priorities.",

Israeli forces have taken over large areas of Gaza in recent weeks in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law.",

Wednesday's charges are the second time a group of correctional officers in New York was indicted for a death behind bars this year. Other prisoners say several guards severely beat Messiah Nantwi, a prisoner at the Mid-State Correctional Facility, sending him to a hospital where he died on March 1. The Utica-area facility was one of many state prisons that was struggling to function during a three-week wildcat strike by guards.",
