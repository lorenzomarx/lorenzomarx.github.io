      "description": "Officials say a Russian drone has struck an apartment building in a southeastern Ukraine city, killing three people and injuring 10 others. The attack early Friday came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump rebuked Russia\u2019s leader for a deadly missile and drone attack on Kyiv while Washington endeavors to stop the more than three-year war. Russia pounded Kyiv in an hourslong barrage Thursday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 87 in its deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since July. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday for the second time this month.",

      "description": "Heads of state and royalty will begin converging on Rome for Pope Francis\u2019 funeral in the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, but the group of poor people who will meet his casket in a small crosstown basilica are more in keeping with Francis\u2019 humble persona and disdain for pomp. U.S. President Donald Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei are among the leaders arriving Friday. That is the last day Argentine pope will lie in state in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica before his coffin is sealed in preparation for his funeral Saturday. More than 90,000 mourners have waited hours in line to bid farewell to Francis, who died Monday.",

      "description": "Disgraced former U.S. Rep. George Santos is facing sentencing in federal court this week. The New York Republican pleaded guilty last summer to federal wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos admitted he deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people to fund his congressional campaign. He served less than a year in Congress before being expelled in 2023 after his lies and fraud were uncovered. Prosecutors are seeking seven years in federal prison, but Santos has argued the proposed sentence is overly harsh. His lawyers have called for two years behind bars.",

India immediately described the massacre a \u201cterror attack\u201d and said it had \u201ccross border\u201d links, blaming Pakistan for backing it.

Trump says he\u2019s on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks \u2014 but also suggests it\u2019s \u201cphysically impossible\u201d to hold all the needed meetings. The Republican president has said he'll simply set new tariff rates negotiated internally within the U.S. government over the next few weeks \u2014 although he already did that April 2, causing the world economy to shudder. The sure bet is uncertainty will persist in ways that employers and consumers alike expect to damage the economy and that leave foreign leaders scratching their heads in bewilderment.",

But unlike in his first term, Trump\u2019s efforts have not sparked the kind of widespread condemnation that forced him to retreat from some unpopular positions. Immigration has emerged as one of the Republican president's strongest issues in public polling. The White House has seized on this shift, mocking critics and egging on Democrats to engage on an issue Trump\u2019s team sees as a win.",
