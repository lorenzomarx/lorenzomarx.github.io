In a Senate hearing and interviews with reporters this week, Republican skepticism of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda reached a level unseen since he won the GOP presidential nomination last year. While GOP lawmakers made sure to direct their concern at Trump\u2019s aides and advisers, it still amounted to a rare Republican break from Trump.

Those House Republicans are refusing to accept a Senate GOP budget framework approved over the weekend because it doesn\u2019t cut enough. Trump summoned House Republicans to the White House for a Tuesday meeting. But many Republicans left unmoved. Next steps are uncertain. The beleaguered speaker wants to nudge the process forward before lawmakers leave for a two-week spring recess.
