      "description": "President Donald Trump began his White House briefing with a moment of silence and a prayer for the victims of Wednesday\u2019s crash at Reagan National Airport. But his remarks quickly became a diatribe against diversity hiring. Trump on Thursday variously pointed the finger at the helicopter\u2019s pilot, air traffic control, his predecessor, Joe Biden, and other Democrats including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom he labeled a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Buttigieg responded by calling Trump \u201cdespicable.\u201d The cause of the crash is still unknown. Authorities are investigating and have not publicly identified the cause or said who might have been responsible for the collision of an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army helicopter.",

The American Airlines crew members were traveling on a daily route from Wichita, Kansas, to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday night. The soldiers aboard the Black Hawk helicopter were conducting an annual night proficiency training flight. Family and friends have identified three of the four members on the American Airlines flight as pilots Sam Lilley and Jonathan Campos and flight attendant Danasia Elder. Relatives identified two of the soldiers as Ryan O'Hara and Andrew Eaves.",

National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has described the investigation into Wednesday night's crash as an \u201call-hands-on-deck event\u201d for her agency. She appeared at a news conference Thursday with members of the board and a senior investigator overseeing the probe. The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents and other serious incidents in the U.S. Authorities say 60 passengers and four crew died aboard the jet and three soldiers aboard the helicopter.",

Those fears materialized Wednesday night when an American Airlines plane collided with a military helicopter, taking the lives of 67 people, including three soldiers and more than a dozen figure skaters. Even in peak flying conditions, experts say, the airspace around Reagan Washington National Airport can challenge the most experienced pilots, who must navigate hundreds of other commercial planes, military aircraft and restricted areas around sensitive sites.",

The tariffs would also invite retaliation. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, has already vowed to counterpunch by pulling American alcohol off store shelves in the Canadian province. Trump\u2019s tariffs threaten to blow up the trade agreement he himself negotiated with America\u2019s two neighbors in his first term.",

One hostage who was released last year, Ilana Gritzewsky, said she was so full of adrenaline after her release she couldn't sleep for two days. But now, she still struggles with lingering health problems. Her own rehabilitation is hindered by the fact that she's tirelessly advocating for the release of her boyfriend and the other approximately 80 hostages still being held in Gaza. Whether the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will hold and allow freedom for others remains uncertain.",

The asteroid was first spotted last month. It's estimated to be 130 to 330 feet across. It's much too soon to know where on Earth it might strike. Scientists are keeping close watch on the space rock, which is currently heading away from Earth. As the asteroid's path around the sun becomes better understood, space agency officials say there's a good chance the risk to Earth could drop to zero.",

That was the word from authorities Thursday as they scrutinized the actions of the military pilot after the country\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the jet late Wednesday while it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.",

The rules govern how complaints of misconduct are investigated and how to settle cases where students present differing accounts.
