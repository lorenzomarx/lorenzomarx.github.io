      "description": "President Donald Trump says Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. He's also claiming that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States. The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort are causing a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty. And they're threatening to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year\u2019s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. The tariffs are set to launch on Tuesday.",

      "description": "Canada\u2019s prime minister and Mexico\u2019s president have ordered retaliatory tariffs against Americans, following through with their threats after U.S. Donald Trump sparked a trade war by imposing sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. Canada had been very proactive for months saying it will retaliate, while Mexico kept a more cautious approach on recent weeks, but in the end both did what they had promised: retaliate. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum spoke in a telephone call before Trudeau announced Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs but there is no indication the two countries are coordinating responses.",

      "description": "Tariffs are in the news at the moment. But what are they? Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs.",

Canada and Mexico quickly announced retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would take \u201cnecessary countermeasures.\u201d Trump declared an economic emergency Saturday in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a lower 10% rate.
