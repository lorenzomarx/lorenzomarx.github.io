      "description": "Hundreds of weather forecasters and other federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employees on probationary status have been fired, lawmakers and weather experts say. Federal workers who were not let go said the Thursday afternoon layoffs included meteorologists who do crucial local forecasts in National Weather Service offices across the country. Cuts at NOAA appeared to be happening in two rounds, one of 500 and one of 800. That\u2019s about 10% of NOAA\u2019s workforce. Congresswoman Grace Meng of New York called the terminations \u201cunconscionable\u201d and said, \"This action will only endanger American lives going forward.\u201d",

      "description": "Civilian federal jobs are being cut by the thousands, as Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency continues to shrink the government workforce at the behest of President Donald Trump. That\u2019s brought a lot of churn and uncertainty in the nation\u2019s capital, where 20% of the country\u2019s more than 2 million civilian \u2014 or nonmilitary \u2014 federal workers are located. It\u2019s also affecting workers and communities outside the Washington, D.C. area, where about 80% of that workforce is based. Those cuts mean that members of Congress are now facing potential angst among the out-of-work federal employees in their districts across the country. Some of the highest concentrations of federal workers are in places such as Oklahoma, Alaska, Alabama and New Mexico.",

      "description": "A federal judge in San Francisco finds the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful. Thursday\u2019s decision grants temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration\u2019s massive trimming of the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including the Department of Defense. Lawyers for the personnel office say individual agencies made the decision to fire employees and that it had no role in ordering the firings.",

That's according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. The five men represent Republican and Democratic administrations over the past three decades. They said the dismissals raised troubling questions about the administration\u2019s desire to politicize the military. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the firing of Gen. CQ Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs, saying that other presidents made changes in military personnel and that Trump deserves to pick his own team.",

      "description": "The Social Security Administration is preparing to lay off at least 7,000 people from its workforce of 60,000 \u2014 and the final reduction in force number could be as high as 50%, according to two people familiar with the agency\u2019s plans who are not authorized to speak publicly. It\u2019s unclear how the layoffs will directly impact benefits of the 72.5 million beneficiaries, including retirees and children who receive retirement and disability benefits. However, advocates and Democratic lawmakers warn that layoffs will reduce the agency\u2019s ability to serve recipients in a timely manner. The layoffs are part of the Trump administration\u2019s intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, run by Trump advisor Elon Musk.",
