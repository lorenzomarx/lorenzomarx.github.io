      "description": "The jury in Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial is set to resume deliberations. The jury reached a verdict Tuesday on all but one of the five counts the hip-hop mogul faces. Judge Arun Subramanian ordered the jury to continue deliberating for a third day on Wednesday. The jury said Tuesday it was unable to reach consensus on the top charge of racketeering conspiracy. It indicated it had already decided about other charges, including sex trafficking. Subramanian, prosecutors and Combs\u2019 defense team said less than 13 hours of deliberations was too soon to give up on reaching a verdict on all counts. The jury's partial verdict remains under wraps for now.",

      "description": "More than two years after the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students shocked the rural community of Moscow, Idaho, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders is expected in court Wednesday to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty. Brian Kohberger agreed to the plea deal in the past few days, just weeks before his trial was to begin, after his attorneys tried but failed to have execution stricken as a possible punishment. The deal drew mixed reactions from the victims' families, ranging from support to outrage that Kohberger would live.",

      "description": "House Republicans are sprinting toward a vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cuts package. The Republicans are looking to seize momentum from a hard-fought vote in the Senate, essentially daring members with concerns to defy Trump and vote against it. The bill will extend and make permanent various individual and business tax breaks Republicans passed in Trump\u2019s first term, plus temporarily add new tax breaks, such as no income taxes on tips and overtime. The House already passed one version of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It's unclear if House Republicans will be able to do the same with the Senate-amended version Wednesday.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump keeps saying that Republicans\u2019 mega tax and spending cut legislation will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits. It does not. Instead of eliminating the tax, the Senate and House have each passed their own versions of a temporary tax deduction for seniors aged 65 and over, which applies to all income \u2014 not just Social Security. And it turns out not all Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction. Those who won\u2019t be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don\u2019t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.",

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced Israel's agreement to a 60-day ceasefire plan. Trump urged Hamas to accept it before conditions worsen. A Hamas official on Wednesday stopped short of accepting the proposal announced by Trump. Israel hasn't publicly commented but maintains it will only end the war if Hamas surrenders and disarms. But Hamas refuses to do so. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to travel to the White House next week to discuss Gaza and other matters.",

Ukrainian officials said draft legislation to support the effort will be voted on later this month. The U.S. has cited concerns over its own stockpiles for the halt in shipments.

      "description": "Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has said the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending speculation ignited by his remark that he might be the last person to hold the role. Speaking at prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said in a recorded statement the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized following Buddhist traditions. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated. His succession plan is politically consequential for Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of the territory. China has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.",

      "description": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban. The court\u2019s liberal majority ruled 4-3 on Wednesday that the ban is no longer valid because newer abortion restrictions superseded it. State lawmakers adopted the total ban in 1849. It was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nullified it, and was never repealed. Conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision overturning Roe reactivated the prohibition. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued, arguing that a 1985 state law that prohibits abortions after viability essentially repealed the ban.",
