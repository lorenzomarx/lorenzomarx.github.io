      "description": "Top Trump administration officials visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-up immigration enforcement in the nation\u2019s third-largest city as federal agencies touted arrests around the country. \u201cBorder czar\u201d Tom Homan and Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove were in Chicago. Few details of the operation were immediately made public, including any arrests. Federal agents in Colorado detained about 50 people in an operation targeting drug trafficking by a Venezuelan hang. The sheer number of federal agencies involved showed President Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to use federal law enforcement beyond the Department of Homeland Security to carry out his long-promised mass deportations.",

      "description": "President Trump is reversing his predecessor\u2019s efforts to clean up areas hardest hit by pollution from heavy industry, ports and roadways \u2013 communities that are often largely Black, Latino and low-income. He eliminated the \u201cJustice 40\u201d initiative the Biden created which required 40% of the benefits from certain environmental programs go to hard-hit communities. He disbanded a team of White House advisors who focus on the issue. It's part of a spate of early executive orders that align with Trump's campaign pledge to slash regulations and eliminate an emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion. The new administration actions end a short-lived federal embrace of environmental justice.",

Issues confronting him range from global conflicts and border security to administrative tasks. He'll have to address President Donald Trump\u2019s priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern border. And Hegseth will be reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law enforcement. That's something done rarely. He'll have decisions to make about aid to Ukraine, the ceasefire in Gaza and troop deployments in the Mideast. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the government of diversity programs and personnel.",
