      "description": "House Republicans are preparing to push their hard-fought package of tax breaks and spending cuts through its next hurdle in the Budget Committee. But renegade conservatives have warned they'll vote against it Friday without further changes. Tallying a whopping 1,116 pages, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is teetering at a critical moment. Conservatives are holding out for steeper cuts to Medicaid and other programs to help offset the costs of the tax breaks. Lawmakers from high-tax states including New York are demanding a deeper local tax deduction. House Speaker Mike Johnson insists Republicans are on track with the bill he says will shore up the economy.",

      "description": "At least 82 people were killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza on Friday, as US President Donald Trump wrapped up his regional trip. Strikes overnight and into Friday hit across Gaza, including the outskirts of Deir al-Balah and the city of Khan Younis. At least 66 people were killed according to the Indonesian hospital, where most of the bodies were taken. A further 16 bodies were taken to Nasser hospital, said health officials. The widespread attacks across northern Gaza come as Trump finishes his visit to Gulf states but not Israel. There had been widespread hope that Trump\u2019s regional visit could usher in a ceasefire deal or renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza.",

A Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov sat down Friday with a low-level Russian team headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. That's according to Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson who published a photo of the meeting. The officials present sat around a U-shaped table, with the Russians and Ukrainians facing each other. Officials and observers expect the Turkish-brokered talks to yield little immediate progress on stopping the more than three-year war.",

Hadi Matar was sentenced Friday in a western New York courtroom, where a jury found him guilty earlier this year of attempted murder and assault. The 27-year-old stabbed Rushdie multiple times, blinding him in one eye, as the author was about to speak at the Chautauqua Institution. Matar next faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges. Although the first trial focused mostly on the details of the knife attack itself, the next one is expected to delve into the more complicated issue of motive.",
