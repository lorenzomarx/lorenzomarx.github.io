      "description": "The German government says that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Berlin on Wednesday to join Chancellor Friedrich Merz for talks with European and U.S. leaders ahead of the Trump-Putin summit later this week. Merz has convened a series of virtual meetings on Wednesday in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukraine\u2019s leaders heard ahead of a summit that they have been sidelined from. Zelenskyy is due to meet with European leaders first, to prepare for a virtual call with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance about an hour later.",

      "description": "Wildfires are raging across southern Europe, killing at least three people in Spain, Turkey and Albania. Thinly-stretched crews are fighting to contain blazes after weeks of searing heat. A nightlong battle to protect the perimeter of Greece\u2019s third-largest city, Patras, has so far failed to contain the gale-fueled blaze. In southern Albania a wildfire caused explosions after detonating buried World War II-era artillery shells. Officials said Wednesday an 80-year-old man died in one blaze south of the capital, Tirana. A firefighting volunteer died in Spain, while a forestry worker was killed in southern Turkey.",

      "description": "Sections of Alaska\u2019s capital city are bracing for the arrival of what could be record floodwaters due to rainwater and snowmelt flowing downstream from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier. Residents in some parts of Juneau have evacuated. Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern for residents. On Tuesday, officials confirmed water had started escaping the ice dam and was flowing downstream, with flooding expected into Wednesday. In past years the flooding has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. The Mendenhall Glacier is a thinning, retreating glacier that acts as a dam for Suicide Basin, which fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hinting that ceasefire efforts are now focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages in Gaza all at once. Arab officials told The Associated Press last week that mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new framework for a deal that would include the release of all hostages in one go in return for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The long-running indirect talks appeared to break down last month. But Egyptian state-run media reports that a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for talks on Tuesday.",

      "description": "Shares have advanced in Europe and Asia after the U.S. stock market rallied to records when data showed inflation across the United States improved slightly last month. U.S. futures also gained, while benchmarks in Tokyo and several other Asian markets jumped more than 1%. A recent rally in share prices has been driven partly by relief over an extended truce in President Donald Trump's trade war with China, and partly by persisting hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 1.1% and topped its all-time high. The Dow industrials jumped 1.1% and the Nasdaq composite surged 1.4% to set its own record. Lower rates can help boost the economy and investment prices.",

Bowser emphasized that crime has been dropping and Trump's state of emergency doesn't match the numbers. She acknowledged that the city has little choice but to comply. Bowser linked the takeover to the larger issue of D.C. statehood, stating that limited autonomy makes the city vulnerable. Trump's decision fits a pattern of using emergency declarations to rule by executive order. Bowser maintains that violent crime has decreased, a claim supported by Trump's former U.S. attorney nominee.",
