They are experimenting with pigs to simulate how human bodies decompose, and researchers are using satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques to study changes in the porcine graves. They hope the research will enhance efforts to find the more than 130,000 reported missing across Mexico. Jalisco, a state heavily affected by disappearances, is a focal point for this research. While technology isn't a complete solution, it complements traditional methods such as witness testimonies and digging.",
