      "description": "The U.N. food agency says Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have blocked and offloaded dozens of food trucks as desperation mounts following Israel\u2019s monthslong blockade and airstrikes. The World Food Program said Saturday that 77 trucks carrying aid, mostly flour, were stopped by hungry people who took the food before the trucks were able to reach their destination. Hamas meanwhile is reviewing a U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that negotiators were nearing a deal. A truce would pause the fighting for 60 days and release some of the 58 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and food aid.",

Many Black women have hair types and workplace-favored styles that require careful attention. They can spend hundreds of dollars at salons each month on extensions, weaves, wigs and braids. Most hair, salon tools and packaging is imported from China. Stylists are considering raising their prices while the the U.S. and China negotiate new trade agreements. But many dread what price increases will do for clients who are lower income and already strained by months of inflation on virtually everything else.",

But after Trump declared a \u201cnational energy emergency,\u201d it took just 11 days for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to approve the Velvet-Wood uranium mine's plan for resuming operations in the red-rock desert south of Moab, Utah. More fast approvals could be coming. But U.S. uranium mining has a long way to go to offset imports. About 98% of the uranium used in U.S. power plants currently is imported.",
