      "description": "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz is set to depart the Trump administration. That's according to two people familiar with the matter, which marks the first major staff shakeup of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Waltz came under searing scrutiny in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on the encrypted messaging app Signal, which was used to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. A far-right ally of the president, Laura Loomer, has also targeted Waltz, telling Trump in a recent Oval Office conversation that he needs to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda.",

      "description": "A federal judge has barred the Trump administration from deporting any Venezuelans from South Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. is the first judge to rule that the Alien Enemies Act cannot be used against people who the Republican administration claims are gang members invading the United States. In March, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the U.S. He said he had special powers to deport immigrants, identified by his administration as gang members, without the usual court proceedings.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is calling for more reliance on behavioral therapy for transgender youth instead of broader gender-affirming medical care. A report from the Department of Health and Human Services questions the current practices and medical groups that endorse them. The administration\u2019s position released Thursday sprang from Trump\u2019s executive order calling for the federal government not to support gender transition for people under age 19. A court has put some parts of the order on hold. The new report is one of several ways Trump and his administration have contradicted guidelines for treating transgender people accepted by major medical organizations.",

      "description": "U.S. defense officials say the number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year and there was a significant drop in the Army. It\u2019s the second year in a row with a decrease. That reverses a troubling trend that\u2019s plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade. The officials say that while the decline is a good sign, the numbers of reported assaults are still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the report hasn\u2019t been publicly released.",

NASA's Anne McClain emerged from the International Space Station on Thursday alongside Nichole Ayers. They launched to the orbiting lab in March to replace NASA's two stuck astronauts, who are now back home. During their spacewalk, the pair will prepare the space station for new solar panels and move an antenna. McClain should have taken part in the first all-female spacewalk in 2019, but there weren't enough medium-size suits. The latest was the fifth all-female spacewalk in 60 years of spacewalking.",

At age 15, she's still got it. And researchers say she was better than people at keeping rhythm. Findings were published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. Ronan joins a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
