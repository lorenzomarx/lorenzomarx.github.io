At the same time, he tried offering a positive take on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of his contentious White House meeting with the Republican president and Vice President JD Vance.",

      "description": "The U.S. Cyber Command is pausing its offensive operations against Russia. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made the decision, which was confirmed Monday by a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations. The suspension of some cybersecurity preparations comes as many national security experts warn of a greater threat posed by Russia, China and other adversaries. Hegseth\u2019s decision doesn't affect cyberoperations conducted by other agencies, including the CIA. U.S. Cyber Command oversees and coordinates defensive and offensive cybersecurity work for the Pentagon and is known as America's first line of defense in cyberspace.",

      "description": "As his White House meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart devolved into a stunning blowup, President Donald Trump leaned on a familiar refrain to explain his unique kinship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He said that Putin had \u201csuffered\u201d through the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The reference underscored the extent to which Trump\u2019s lingering fury over an inquiry he has misleadingly branded a \u201choax\u201d remains top of mind even now. It also showed that Trump\u2019s view of a war that Russia launched in Ukraine three years ago is colored not only by his relationship with Putin but also by his experience with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

The extraordinarily frank criticism from Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou came in a parliamentary debate on Ukraine on Monday.

      "description": "Israel has introduced what it said was a new U.S. ceasefire plan and is trying to force Hamas to accept it by imposing a siege on the Gaza Strip. The plan is different from the one the two sides agreed to in January. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to it as the \u201cWitkoff proposal.\u201d He says it came from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff. But the White House has yet to confirm that. Netanyahu\u2019s remarks came a day after the first phase of the negotiated ceasefire ended, with no clarity on what would come next since the agreement\u2019s second phase has not yet been hammered out. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",

      "description": "China's leaders are overseeing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world. While cheaper prices can be a blessing, deflation is a symptom of relatively weak demand and stalling economic growth. Falling housing prices have left many families reluctant to spend, while factories keep churning out goods. This has led to the country's longest deflationary streak since the 1960s. Deflation is an abstract economic concept but it reflects very concretely in family balance sheets. Economists say it may signal bigger trouble ahead, while rising tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States could dent demand, further aggravating the problem.",

The heated conversation that played out live on television looms over all American support for Ukraine and could shape the country\u2019s war against the Russian invasion. The scene will almost certainly stick with Zelenskyy for the rest of his presidency, if not his life. American officials have said that they want an apology from Zelenskyy.
