      "description": "Pope Francis\u2019 body will be moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to lie in state allowing the Catholic faithful to pay their respects to the Argentine pope. Francis is being remembered for his humble style, concern for the poor and insistent prayers for peace. Heads of state are expected for the funeral Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square. But the three days of public viewing are largely for ordinary Catholics to mourn the 88-year-old pope. Francis died Monday after suffering a stroke. His body will be transferred Wednesday morning to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The public mourning period will end on Friday night.",

      "description": "Pope Francis had a learning curve on clergy sexual abuse, with the turning point coming in 2018. Few people could have predicted that a comment he made then, dismissing victims of Chile's most notorious pedophile, would blow up into the biggest crisis of his papacy. But it was one that eventually set the Catholic Church on a new path of accountability for clergy sexual abuse. Years later, Francis recognized that the Chile trip was his \u201cconversion\u201d moment, when he came to realize he had been misled about just how bad the problem was.",

Tuesday's attack appears to be a major shift in a regional conflict in which tourists have largely been spared from violence. Two senior police officers say at least four gunmen, whom they described as militants, fired at dozens of tourists from close range. The officers say at least three dozen people were wounded, with many of them reported to be in serious condition. The region's top elected official says the attack is \u201cmuch larger than anything we\u2019ve seen directed at civilians in recent years.\u201d",

But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. President Donald Trump placed a 145% import tax on China, which countered with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures.",

That's according to the International Coral Reef Initiative. Warming oceans cause corals to expel the colorful algae living inside of them, putting the coral at risk of death. Healthy corals are essential for seafood production, jobs and coastline protection worldwide. Scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gases that are the main driver of atmospheric warming. Last year was the warmest on record, and much of that heat is going into oceans.",
