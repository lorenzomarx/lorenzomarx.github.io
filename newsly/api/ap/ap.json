      "description": "Two top European leaders have stiffened their spines over unsettling new policies from President Donald Trump. Ukraine\u2019s president urged creation of an \u201carmed forces of Europe\u201d and the leader of Germany denounced meddling in its election after U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with a German far-right leader. Strident speeches from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday testified to the impact of Trump decisions that have resonated at home and in Europe. Those include Trump's hopes to end the Russia-Ukraine war and nurture political allies.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is taking a blowtorch to the rules that have governed world trade for decades. The \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs that he announced Thursday are likely to create chaos for global businesses and conflict with America\u2019s allies and adversaries alike. Pointing to America\u2019s massive trade deficits, Trump charges that the playing field is tilted against U.S. companies. A big reason for that, he and his advisers say, is because other countries usually tax American exports at a higher rate than America taxes theirs. Trump has a fix: He\u2019s raising U.S. tariffs to match what other countries charge. Economists don\u2019t share Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for tariffs. They\u2019re a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers.",

      "description": "Some white South Africans have showed support for President Donald Trump and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own government. Hundreds of protesters held placards Saturday that read \u201cThank God for President Trump\u201d and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority. Many were from the white Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the South African government.",

      "description": "U.S. conservatives have looked to Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n as an inspiration for a right-wing America, and the prime minister has become a close ally of President Donald Trump. During Orb\u00e1n's 15 years in power, he's transformed Hungary from a young democracy into what the European Parliament calls an \u201celectoral autocracy.\u201d The Orb\u00e1n-Trump relationship is drawing renewed interest as Trump pushes to expand his presidential power in his second term. While the countries\u2019 systems of government are different, there are striking parallels between Trump\u2019s actions and agenda, and what Orb\u00e1n has achieved in Hungary.",

      "description": "A traffic stop in Vermont has cracked open a cultlike group called Zizians linked to six deaths in three states. Officials have offered few details about their cross-country investigation, but police and court records, interviews and online postings point to a small group of young computer scientists portrayed as highly intelligent and increasingly violent. Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence. The dead include Border Patrol Agent David Maland, two members of the group, the parents of another member and a California landlord who tried to evict some of them.",

The private plane was parked at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday. The current Air Force One planes are more than 30 years old. Boeing has had to push delivery of the new versions from 2024 to 2027 and 2028. Trump has railed against the project's cost and the delivery delays. Boeing's CEO recently said Trump adviser Elon Musk is working with the company to help speed delivery.",
