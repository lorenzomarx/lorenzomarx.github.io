      "description": "In the first three weeks of his administration, President Donald Trump has moved with brazen haste to dismantle the federal government\u2019s public integrity guardrails that he frequently tested during his first term. In a span of hours on Monday, word came that he had forced out leaders of offices responsible for government ethics and whistleblower complaints. And in a boon to corporations, he ordered a pause to enforcement of a decades-old law that prohibits American companies from paying bribes to win business in foreign countries. That\u2019s all on top of the firings of more than a dozen inspectors general tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies.",

In a nearly hour-long speech on the House floor, Mace accused her ex-fianc\u00e9 of physically abusing her and recording sex acts with her and others without their consent. She said she also has evidence of him conspiring with business associates in acts of rape and sexual misconduct. The former fianc\u00e9, Patrick Bryant, categorically denied all the allegations. Mace said she was speaking out because South Carolina's top prosecutor didn\u2019t take action. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson's office called Mace's comments about the prosecutor\u2019s conduct \u201ccategorically false.\u201d",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic. Trump signed an executive order to reverse federal policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic straws. Trump has long railed against paper straws, and his 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws. His move targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, by 2035. Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws because they pollute oceans and waterways and harm marine life. Some restaurants no longer automatically give plastic straws to customers.",

Cameron Hamilton is the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and his Monday comments came after Elon Musk blasted the transactions. Musk posted on X that his team had discovered $59 million sent to New York City to house people in the country illegally in hotels. Musk gave no evidence. Information from the city indicated that the money the city has received from the federal government to care for migrants was appropriated by Congress and allocated to the city last year by FEMA.

He warned that the program to forcefully deport people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \u201cwill end badly.\u201d Francis took the remarkable step of addressing the migrant crackdown in a letter Tuesday to U.S. bishops. The letter appeared to take direct aim at Vice President JD Vance\u2019s defense of the deportation program. History\u2019s first Latin American pope has long made caring for migrants a priority of his pontificate, demanding that countries welcome, protect, promote and integrate those fleeing conflicts, poverty and climate disasters.",

A pro-Palestinian legal group had convinced a federal judge in Brazil to open a war crimes investigation for his alleged participation in the demolition of civilian homes in Gaza. The group, the Hind Rajab Foundation, has brought dozens of complaints in more than 10 countries, using a legal concept called \u201cuniversal jurisdiction,\u201d which allows governments to prosecute people for the most serious crimes regardless of where they are allegedly committed. Its campaign has yet to yield any arrests. The army reservist vacationing in Brazil fled the country and returned to Israel.",

      "description": "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions. Some of the efforts appear to be stalled this year. It's too early to tell whether others will gain momentum. Several states have banned abortion, but only Louisiana so far has specifically classified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances. The move can increase penalties for people who possess them without prescriptions. No state has passed a law to allow charges against a woman who obtains an abortion. One scholar says introducing legislation can normalize the debates on ideas previously seen as extreme.",
