      "description": "The former Prince Andrew has moved out of his long-time home on crown-owned land near Windsor Castle earlier than expected, after the latest release of documents from the U.S. investigation of Jeffrey Epstein revived questions about his friendship with the convicted sex offender. The 65-year-old brother of King Charles III, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, left the Royal Lodge in Windsor on Monday and is now living on the king\u2019s Sandringham estate in eastern England. That's according to a person familiar with the matter said. British media reported that Mountbatten-Windsor will live temporarily at Wood Farm Cottage while his permanent home on the estate undergoes repairs.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the situation in Iran in a wide-ranging call that comes as the U.S. administration pushes Beijing and others to isolate Tehran. Trump said Wednesday the two leaders also discussed Taiwan and his plans to visit Beijing. Trump continues to weigh taking military action against Iran. Trump announced last month he'd impose a 25% tax on imports to the U.S. from countries that do business with Iran. Years of sanctions aimed at stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear program have left the country isolated. But the World Trade Organization says Tehran still did nearly $125 billion in international trade in 2024, including $32 billion with China.",

Oman hosted multiple rounds of earlier nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S. The U.S. has not acknowledge the talks would take place in Oman, though the White House said it anticipated the negotiations would take place even after the U.S. shot down an Iranian drone on Tuesday and Iran attempted to stop a U.S.-flagged ship.",

The motion filed Wednesday also requests the unsealing of a law enforcement agent's sworn statement. That statement was presented to the judge who approved the search warrant. The motion isn't being released because the case is under seal. The search took place on Jan. 28 at Fulton County\u2019s main election facility. Fulton County votes overwhelmingly Democratic. It's been a target of Donald Trump and his allies since the Republican narrowly lost the state to Joe Biden in 2020.",

Congress is discussing potential new rules for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other officers who are conducting immigration arrests after the deaths of two Minneapolis protesters in January. The negotiations come during some bipartisan sentiment that Congress should step in to de-escalate tensions that have rocked Minnesota and other states. But it\u2019s unclear if the president or enough congressional Republicans will agree to any of the Democrats\u2019 larger demands.",

Critical minerals are needed for everything from jet engines to smartphones. China dominates the market for those ingredients crucial to high-tech products.",
