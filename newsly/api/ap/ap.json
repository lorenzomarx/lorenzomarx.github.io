      "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s top leaders have doubled down on how destructive the U.S. attacks had been on Iran's nuclear facilities. And they described in detail the study and planning behind the bombing mission. In a rare Pentagon press briefing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine tried to shift the debate from whether the nuclear targets were \u201cobliterated,\u201d as President Donald Trump has said, and focus on what they portrayed as the heroism and extensive research and preparation that went into carrying them out. Hegseth said once more than an early assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency was preliminary.",

CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Kaine are expected to give the classified briefing to senators on Thursday. It comes as questions swirl in Congress about the effectiveness of the attack and what\u2019s ahead for America\u2019s military involvement in the Middle East. Also, senators are weighing their support for a resolution affirming that Trump should seek authorization from Congress before launching more military action against Iran.",

But the prosecutors Thursday also said that they would comply with all court orders and that their plans are not imminent. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia earlier asked the federal judge to order his return to Maryland when he is released from jail in Tennessee, an arrangement that would prevent likely attempts by immigration officials to quickly deport Abrego Garcia.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court is letting South Carolina block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. For abortion opponents, it's a victory for the idea that states with more restrictive abortion laws shouldn't have to support groups that provide services policymakers disagree with. Abortion rights supporters frame the ruling as a blow to health care access. The ruling comes as the U.S. Senate is considering a national ban on federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Federal policy already blocks paying for most abortions. The restrictions in question would bar public funding for other services offered by Planned Parenthood.",

It\u2019s a blow to Republicans rushing to finish the package this week. The guidance from the parliamentarian is rarely ignored and forces GOP leaders to consider options. Republicans could try to revise it or strip it from the package. Otherwise, the provision could be challenged during floor votes. Democrats are unified against the Republican president's bill. And even GOP senators warn the tax change would hurt rural hospitals. Some Republicans call for challenging or even firing the parliamentarian, the nonpartisan chief arbiter of Senate rules.",
