      "description": "Malnutrition and hunger are prevelant in the Gaza strip as Israel\u2019s blockade enters its third month. Shortage of food and supplies has driven the territory toward starvation. Supplies to treat and pervent malnutrition are depeleted and quickly running out as documented cases of malnutrition rise. Some 3,600 children were admitted and treated for acute malnutrition in the past month_ a figure that is likely rising. Parents are running out of options of what to feed their children and where to take fhem to get help. Images of emaciated children are becoming more frequent and hungry children at community kitchens are fighting for food, alongside adults.",

      "description": "Morocco's ports have emerged as a flashpoint in protests against the country's decision to normalize ties with Israel. A year and a half of protests have emboldened activists and exposed a gulf between the government and those they govern. Demonstrators from across the political spectrum have taken to the streets to target the country's 4-year-old decision to normalize ties with Israel. Activists accuse the government of disregarding public sentiment and are expanding their targets, which now include the country's strategic ports. Protests swelled this month ahead of the docking of vessels suspected of carrying military cargo as part of a program that includes Israel.",

Eleven candidates are vying for the presidency and a May 18 runoff is expected. A median of local polls suggests George Simion, a MAGA-style hard-right nationalist, will emerge as the frontrunner, likely pitting him against Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, or the governing coalition\u2019s candidate Crin Antonescu.",

      "description": "While Pope Francis accomplished a lot in his 12-year papacy, he left much unfinished business and many challenges for his successor \u2014 from the Vatican\u2019s disastrous finances to the wars raging on multiple continents. When the conclave\u2019s cardinals finish casting their ballots in the Sistine Chapel, the 267th pope will have to decide whether to continue with Francis\u2019 policies, radically change them, or abandon them altogether. He also must choose what new projects will take precedence. Among the pressing issues are the role of women in the church, the division between traditionalists and progressives, what to do about clergy sex abuse and whether to LGBTQ+ Catholics.",

Viterbo is also considered the birthplace of the modern conclave, where cardinals are confined to a single place until they elect a new pontiff and often need to negotiate to reach a compromise on the final name.",

The social media post comes as the mourning of Pope Francis continues and the papal conclave is set to begin in a few days. The image is raising eyebrows on social media, at the Vatican, from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and from Italians. Catholics are in the period of official mourning after Francis' death. Catholic cardinals are due to open the solemn conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday. The death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics",

Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party won an emphatic victory in elections on Saturday. As vote counting continued, the government was on track to win at least 85 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties need a majority to form an administration. Labor held 78 seats in the previous Parliament, and gaining seats in a second term is rare in Australian politics. Albanese told reporters on Sunday: \u201cThe Australian people voted for unity rather than division.\u201d Opposition leader Peter Dutton lost his parliamentary seat. His coalition was reduced to 37 seats.",
