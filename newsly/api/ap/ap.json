      "description": "Russia launched 550 drones and missiles across Ukraine overnight in the largest aerial assaults since the war began. The capital Kyiv was the primary target. At least 23 people were injured, and multiple residential buildings in the capital were damaged. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 270 targets and another 208 targets were lost from radar and presumed jammed, but dozens still struck or caused damage across the city. Fires and destruction were reported in at least five of Kyiv's 10 districts, and railway infrastructure was also hit. The attack came hours after President Donald Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and made his first public comments on the U.S. decision to pause some shipments of weapons to Ukraine.",

      "description": "Up all night, House Republicans voted pre-dawn to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cuts package. The House is now starting a round of debates ahead of a final vote expected later Thursday morning. GOP leaders worked almost around the clock trying to persuade skeptical holdouts. Trump worked the phones as Republicans race to send the bill to his desk by the Fourth of July deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson had recalled lawmakers to Washington, eager to seize on the momentum of the 887-page bill's passage the day before in the Senate. Some GOP lawmakers are criticizing the legislation as straying from the party's fiscal goals. Johnson expects votes later Thursday morning.",

      "description": "Republicans in Congress have muscled President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending bill to passage. At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. The House approved the bill on Thursday, the final step necessary to get the bill to Trump's desk by the GOP\u2019s self-imposed deadline of July 4th. The bill would make permanent many of the tax breaks passed in Trump's first term while also adding new ones, such as new tax deductions for tips, overtime, seniors and interest payments on auto loans.",

Organizers see the coming year of festivities, which start Thursday, as a way to help unite a polarized country and bridge partisan divides.

As a candidate, Trump proposed a \u201cGreat American State Fair\u201d in Iowa, but it will take place next year in Washington instead.",

Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements and are already financially strained. While the measure includes $50 billion to help make up the loss to rural hospitals, advocates worry it won\u2019t offset the funding shortfall. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.
