      "description": "A traffic stop in Vermont has cracked open a cultlike group called Zizians linked to six deaths in three states. Officials have offered few details about their cross-country investigation, but police and court records, interviews and online postings point to a small group of young computer scientists portrayed as highly intelligent and increasingly violent. Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence. The dead include Border Patrol Agent David Maland, two members of the group, the parents of another member and a California landlord who tried to evict some of them.",

In the early going, he's empowered Elon Musk to help force the firing of thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies. The new president has imposed tariffs, wiped out diversity programs and rolled back transgender rights. His administration has begun an immigration crackdown that's been overshadowed by so many other steps. At the same time, the economy is beginning to soften, judges are having their say and even some Republicans in Congress are starting to grumble.",
