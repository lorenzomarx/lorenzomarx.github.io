      "description": "Israel\u2019s military warned people Thursday to evacuate the area around Iran\u2019s Arak heavy water reactor. The warning came in a social media post on X. It included a satellite image of the plant in a red circle like other warnings that proceeded strikes. The Arak heavy water reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",

      "description": "An Iranian missile hit the main hospital in southern Israel early Thursday, wounding people and causing \u201cextensive damage,\u201d the medical facility said. Separate Iranian strikes hit a high-rise apartment building in Tel Aviv and other sites in central Israel. At least 40 people were wounded, according to Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom rescue service. Israel, meanwhile, carried out strikes on Iran\u2019s Arak heavy water reactor, its latest attack on Iran\u2019s sprawling nuclear program. Iranian state TV said the facility had been evacuated before the attack. The seventh day of conflict came a day after Iran\u2019s supreme leader rejected U.S. calls for surrender and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause \u201cirreparable damage to them.\u201d",

Visiting the site with top officials on Thursday, Zelenskyy called the attack a sign Russia is rejecting ceasefire efforts. He thanked allies ready to push the Kremlin to \u201cfeel the real cost of the war.\u201d The strike was part of Russia\u2019s largest assault on Kyiv this year amid a broader offensive along the front line. While Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he\u2019s open to talks on ending the war, he has effectively rejected a U.S. ceasefire offers.",

The justices\u2019 6-3 decision Wednesday effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to the one in Tennessee. Chief Justice John Roberts writes for a conservative majority the law does not violate the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same. Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissent joined by her liberal colleagues that the majority \u201cabandons transgender children and their families to political whims.\u201d",
