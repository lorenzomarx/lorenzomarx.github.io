      "description": "A summit of European leaders to discuss Ukraine's defense has been overshadowed by the diplomatic row at the White House. The meeting in London on Sunday has taken on new importance since talks broke down between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he\u2019s determined to find an end to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as he hosts the gathering to discuss shoring up defenses across Europe. The meeting was supposed to cap a week of diplomacy by France and Britain to bring Trump closer to Ukraine as he talks with Russia about ending the war.",

      "description": "Britain is hosting a summit of European leaders to shore up support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump that left many uncertain where the once staunch allies stood. The London meeting on Sunday has now taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally and boosting the continent\u2019s defenses. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will welcome leaders of more than a dozen countries and other officials to the gathering, embraced Zelenskyy on his arrival in London on Saturday, saying he is determined to find an end to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",

      "description": "Key Republicans and Democrats have been stalwart supporters of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But a blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to sign a deal Friday that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Instead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance further splintered American political support for Ukraine. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has backed Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster.\"",

      "description": "Ukrainians have rallied around President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a defender of their country\u2019s interests in the hours after he left the White House after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump. Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy during an Oval Office meeting on Friday for what they saw as a lack of gratitude for past U.S. aid, a confrontation that pleased Moscow. The friction cast doubt on future U.S. support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia. But despite the diplomatic fallout, many Ukrainians supported Zelenskyy\u2019s firm stance. Officials across Ukraine praised their leader's resilience, while some cautioned against losing crucial U.S. backing.",

It also shows the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect U.S. foreign policy priorities toward his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term. The episode has left in doubt the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia.",

The argument, broadcast globally on Friday, was perhaps unique in American history. It led to the rest of Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit being canceled and called into question how much the U.S. will still support Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.",

He's undertaken a purge at the FBI and Department of Justice. He's forced out federal officials who are responsible for overseeing ethics and protecting whistleblowers. He's declared control over independent agencies such as the Federal Elections Commission. And he's gone after the arts and the media. Trump says he's the one who's saving American democracy. Yet his actions have raised alarms that the country's 240-year-old form of democratic government is under threat.",

Named for a rare species of fireflies, Blue Ghost blasted off from Florida in January. Two other companies' landers are hot on its heels, with the next one targeting a landing later this week.
