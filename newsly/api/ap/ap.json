      "description": "Texas and Oklahoma are bracing for ice and heavy snow in what forecasters predict will be some of the initial major effects of a huge winter storm. The forecasted days-long event threatens catastrophic damage, extensive power outages and bitterly cold weather in the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. Forecasters warn the storm could rival a hurricane in damage to power lines and trees, especially in areas with heavy ice. The storm is expected to start Friday in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, moving east through the South and then up the coast into New England. Bitterly cold air could follow, with wind chills dropping to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota.",

      "description": "A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy has been asking Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest against immigration enforcement in the state. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer during an operation on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the area for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements online and in the streets. But Friday\u2019s mobilization was planned as the largest action to date, including a march in downtown Minneapolis despite dangerously cold temperatures.",

U.S. Southern Command said Friday on social media that the boat was \u201cengaged in narco-trafficking operations\u201d and that the strike killed two people and left one survivor. It said it notified the Coast Guard to launch search and rescue operations. The U.S. military has focused lately on seizing sanctioned oil tankers with connections to Venezuela since the Trump administration launched an audacious raid to capture Maduro. The last boat strikes occurred in late December.",

      "description": "Activists report that Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people. Many more are feared dead, but information is scarce in part because Iran has imposed the most comprehensive internet blackout in its history. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency provided the latest death toll Friday and noted more than 26,800 people have been detained. Iran's government says 3,117 have died, but it has a history of giving lower tolls for political reasons. The Associated Press has been unable to verify these numbers due to the two-week internet shutdown. Meanwhile, the U.S. has moved an aircraft carrier group closer to the Middle East, and President Donald Trump is warning of potential action against Iran.",

School officials claim agents told the boy to knock on a door to lure out his mother. The Department of Homeland Security denies this, calling it a \"horrific smear.\" The father and son are now at a family detention center in Texas. School officials say other adults offered to care for the boy, but agents refused. The family's lawyer is exploring legal options. The Trump administration's policy on detained parents states ICE should not take custody of children, but exceptions exist.",

The ruling extends by two weeks an earlier one in which a judge ordered the money to continue to flow to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York. Judge Vernon Broderick says he'll decide later whether to order the money be kept moving as the challenge to the action is decided. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on Jan. 6 that it was withholding money because it had \u201creason to believe\u201d there was fraud in those states, although it didn\u2019t present details or evidence.",
