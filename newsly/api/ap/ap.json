      "description": "Local health officials say at least 38 Palestinians were killed overnight and into Wednesday in the Gaza Strip while seeking aid from United Nations convoys and sites run by an Israeli-backed American contractor. The Israeli military said it had fired warning shots when crowds approached its forces. The latest deaths came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to announced further military action \u2014 and possibly plans for Israel to fully reoccupy Gaza. Experts say Israel\u2019s ongoing military offensive and blockade are already pushing the territory of some 2 million Palestinians into famine.",

      "description": "Trump has signed an executive order to place an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil. That brings the combined tariffs imposed by the United States on India to 50%. The tariffs would go into effect 21 days after the signing of the order Wednesday, meaning that both India and Russia might have time to negotiate with the administration on the import taxes. Trump\u2019s move could reshape India\u2019s economic ambitions. Many American companies have seen India as an alternative to the Chinese manufacturing that Trump had hoped to diminish through the use of tariffs.",

Researchers found that the August 2023 Maui fire, one of the deadliest in a century, left 1 in 5 people with lung damage and half with symptoms of depression. The fire also nearly doubled suicide and overdose death rates. In Los Angeles, a study found over 400 deaths linked to the fires due to health care disruptions and other factors. Experts say these findings emphasize the broader health risks of extreme climate events. The studies were published Wednesday in two American Medical Association journals.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 18 points, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.4%. McDonald\u2019s and Shopify rose following their profit reports, while Disney fell after its earnings beat forecasts but its revenue fell short. The mixed trading continues a cooldown for the stock market following several sharp swings. Strong profit reports and hopes for cuts to interest rates have helped offset worries about how tariffs may be hurting the economy.",
