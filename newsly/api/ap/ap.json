      "description": "The Supreme Court is meeting Friday to decide the final six cases of its term, including President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to enforce his executive order denying birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally. The justices take the bench at 10 a.m. for their last public session until the start of their new term on Oct. 6. The birthright citizenship order has been blocked nationwide by three lower courts. The Trump administration made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to narrow the court orders that have prevented the citizenship changes from taking effect anywhere in the U.S.",

      "description": "Iran's top diplomat says new nuclear talks with the U.S. are unlikely soon, citing complications from recent American military strikes. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi left open the possibility that his country would again enter talks on its nuclear program during an interview on Iranian state television broadcast late Thursday. But he suggested it would not be anytime soon. On Sunday, the U.S. bombed three key Iranian nuclear facilities. Araghchi acknowledged that \u201cthe level of damage is high.\" Iran retaliated Monday by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, though no casualties were reported.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's unconventional approach to clemency has spread hope among federal prisoners and formerly incarcerated people around the United States, prompting a wave of petitions carefully crafted to capture his attention. Like other presidents, Trump has drawn criticism for granting pardons and commutations to political allies. But legal scholars say the Republican president also has cast aside the traditional criteria and a clemency process historically overseen by nonpolitical Justice Department personnel. Trump has pardoned and commuted the sentences of more than 1,600 people since January. Administration officials say Trump decides on clemency requests after they\u2019re vetted by the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, the White House pardon czar and the Justice Department.",

      "description": "A mother and her two young kids are fighting for their release from a Texas immigration detention center. The lawsuit filed Tuesday is challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policy on immigrant arrests at courthouses. It's believed to be the first lawsuit involving children. It argues that the family\u2019s arrests after entering the U.S. legally using a Biden-era online appointment app violate the family\u2019s Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The mother, her 6-year-old son and her 9-year-old daughter have been held for a month after fleeing Honduras. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
