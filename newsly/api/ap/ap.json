      "description": "A federal judge has blocked Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer issued the order early Saturday after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued President Donald Trump. The case alleges the Trump administration allowed Musk\u2019s team access to the Treasury Department\u2019s central payment system in violation of federal law. Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency was created to discover and eliminate what the Trump administration has deemed to be wasteful government spending.",

      "description": "Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst has hailed Elon Musk and the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. So has Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. Their constituents are following the cost-cutting effort closely. Unlike their top elected officials, several of the constituents are expressing concerns. Some question the delivery of government services or whether Musk has the necessary authority. Others back Musk, saying his action is needed given the risk of doing nothing to sharply curb federal spending.",

They are citing \"threats to the economy and national security, and the potential violation of laws protecting Americans\u2019 privacy and tax data.\u201d The lawmakers, led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, sent letters Friday to Treasury\u2019s deputy inspector general and the acting inspector general for tax administration, as well as to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The letters laid out their concerns over a lack of transparency and public accountability about the access being granted to the federal government\u2019s financial plumbing.",

The five were the second batch of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were freed in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. There was no immediate information available about the last Thai hostage left in Gaza, Nattapong Pingsa, nor the two Thai workers whose bodies were taken into Gaza.",

Republican leaders say Democrats have walked away from negotiations. Not so, say Democrats. The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. The two sides also disagree about following an agreement made in mid-2023 with then-President Joe Biden that would increase spending this budget year by 1% for both defense and nondefense. Democrats want to follow that agreement. Republicans don't.",

They raise questions about funding for certain projects and organizations, often claiming without evidence that the money was used inappropriately. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said to reporters on Tuesday, for example, that USAID had spent $70,000 for the production of a \u201cDEI musical\u201d in Ireland; $47,000 for a \u201ctransgender opera\u201d in Colombia, $32,000 for a \u201ctransgender comic book\u201d in Peru. USAID did not fund those programs. They were awarded by the Department of State's Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.",

      "description": "Hamas-led militants have released three gaunt, frail-looking Israeli hostages and Israel freed 183 Palestinian prisoners in the fifth exchange of a ceasefire agreement that has paused the war in Gaza. The hostages\u2019 condition and scenes of Hamas forcing them to speak in the handover sparked outrage in Israel. It could increase pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend the ceasefire beyond its current six-week phase. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza does not appear to have affected the truce's current phase. But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult one.",

Israel views the prisoners as terrorists, while Palestinians see them as freedom fighters resisting a decadeslong military occupation. Nearly every Palestinian has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel at some point, for militant attacks or lesser offenses such as rock-throwing, protesting or membership in a banned political group. Some are held for months or years without trial.",
