      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off. That's according to a memo Tuesday from the Office of Personnel Management. The memo follows an executive order Trump signed on his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government\u2019s diversity and inclusion programs that could touch on everything from anti-bias training to funding for minority farmers and homeowners. The memo directs agencies to place DEI office staffers on paid leave by 5 p.m. Wednesday, and take down all public DEI-focused webpages by the same deadline.",

      "description": "Alaska's political leaders are cheering an expansive executive order signed by President Donald Trump that aims to boost oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state. But environmental groups cast the policies outlined by Trump as worrisome. Trump signed the order on his first day in office Monday. It was consistent with a wish list submitted by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy shortly after Trump\u2019s election. In many ways, the order seeks to revert to policies that were in place during Trump\u2019s first term. Among other things, it calls for allowing drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",

Trump on Tuesday defended his decision to use his first hours in office to pardon hundreds of people who participated in violence at the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, including the former leaders of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, who were convicted of seditious conspiracy charges but released from prison after Trump signed his order.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump unleashed an unprecedented barrage of executive orders after taking office this week. It's a sign that he's breaching the traditional boundaries of executive power as he returns to the White House. Although he tried to follow a similar playbook during his first term, there are fewer guardrails this time. His administration is stocked with loyalists, there's a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court and Republicans are in full control of Washington. Legal battles could eventually slow Trump down, but in the meantime he's drafting a blunt force blueprint for the presidency.",

In less than two days, the Republican president has moved to end diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government, withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate accords, blocked a federal law banning TikTok, and sought to end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship. Each of those actions enrages part of the Democratic base. Together, they make it difficult to formulate a response by an already fractured party.",

The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president\u2019s help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems. Trump has promised a lighter regulatory touch and picked pro-crypto officials for key government positions. By associating himself so closely with meme coins, some crypto fans worry that Trump hurts his chances to help the wider crypto industry.",
