      "description": "The Trump administration has presented a plan to dramatically cut staffing worldwide for U.S. aid projects as part of its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The proposal would leave fewer than 300 workers out of 8,000 direct-hires and contractors. Two current USAID employees and one former senior USAID official told The Associated Press of the administration\u2019s plan. It was presented to remaining senior officials of the agency Thursday. They spoke on condition of anonymity, in the face of a Trump administration order barring USAID staffers from talking to anyone outside their agency.",

      "description": "A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to push out federal employees by offering them financial incentives. The decision Thursday comes hours before the midnight deadline for workers to apply for the program. U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. in Boston sided with several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan orchestrated by Trump adviser Elon Musk. The Republican president is trying to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. The judge didn't express an opinion on the legality of the program. He scheduled a hearing for Monday and directed administration officials to extend the deadline to apply for the program until after the hearing.",

      "description": "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks. A day after his press secretary cited some $8 million in spending for Politico subscriptions, Trump dubbed it a \u201cscandal\u201d and online sleuths started looking for evidence of payments to other organizations like the New York Times and Associated Press. Said one Trump aide online: \u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions.\u201d But it's actually a long-running tradition, depended upon by governments around the world to help them keep up with what is going on. And, the AP noted, has been a staple of Democratic and Republican administrations.",

Thirteen attorneys general, including New York\u2019s Letitia James, said in a statement issued Thursday that they were taking action in defense of the Constitution, people's right to privacy and essential funding that individuals and communities are counting on. Government officials and labor unions have been among those raising concerns about DOGE\u2019s involvement with the payment system for the federal government. They say it could lead to security risks or missed payments for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.",

      "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s decision to close the U.S. Agency for International Development has drawn widespread criticism from congressional Democrats. The move also raised questions about the influence billionaire ally Elon Musk wields over the federal government. The United States is the world\u2019s largest source of foreign assistance by far, although several European countries allocate a much bigger share of their budgets. USAID funds projects in some 120 countries aimed at fighting epidemics, educating children, providing clean water and supporting other areas of development. The impact of the U.S. decision is hitting projects around the world, from efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest to HIV prevention in South Africa and hospitals in war-ravaged Syria.",

The officials said a NATO-nation ship recorded the radio exchanges involving the Russian eavesdropping vessel Kildin.
