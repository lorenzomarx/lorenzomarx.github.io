      "description": "Ukrainian officials say that Russia pounded the capital with yet another major missile and drone attack. At least least two people were killed in the attack overnight into Thursday. The strikes caused fires across Kyiv a day after the heaviest aerial attack of the war so far. An official in Kyiv said at least 16 people were wounded in the latest barrage. Russia has recently sought to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defenses with major attacks that include increasing numbers of decoy drones. The pressure has caused alarm among Ukrainian officials who are uncertain about continuing vital military aid from the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s policy toward Russia.",

The workers were up to 6 miles from the tunnel\u2019s only entrance Wednesday. Some workers scrambled over a tall mound of loose soil to reach coworkers. They were shuttled to the entrance and hoisted out. Paramedics were evaluating 27 of the workers and officials say none had major injuries. A Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts spokesperson says authorities are still investigating the cause of the cave-in at the nearly $700 million project.",

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron announced the deal Thursday in London. While the initial program will involve only 50 people a week, U.K. officials suggest it is a major breakthrough because it sets a precedent that migrants who reach Britain illegally can be returned to France.",

The vigil was held Wednesday evening to remember of the at least 120 people who died in the catastrophic flash floods over the July Fourth holiday. More than 160 are still believed to be missing in hard-hit Kerr County. People in the crowd clutched one another and brushed away tears during the vigil.

His lawyers filed a claim Thursday, alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution after his March arrest by federal agents. Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, said he suffered severe anguish in jail, and continues to fear for his safety.

Kellogg was founded in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1906. It makes Froot Loops, Special K, Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies. Kellogg has been struggling with falling U.S. cereal consumption as consumers opt for protein bars and other products. But industry watchers say its large distribution network and relations with grocers are appealing to Ferrero. The deal still needs the approval of WK Kellogg's shareholders.",
