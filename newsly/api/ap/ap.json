      "description": "Cardinals are meeting at the Vatican to make the first decisions about running the Catholic Church following the death of Pope Francis. They need to decide when Francis' body will be moved into St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing, when the funeral and burial will take place, and when the conclave will begin to elect his successor. The Congregation of Cardinals, the Tuesday gathering of the cardinals currently in Rome, could choose to begin the public viewing as soon as Wednesday. Under norms approved by Francis last year, the funeral and burial must occur between Friday and Sunday.",

      "description": "Every pope has his critics. But Pope Francis\u2019 conservative opponents were unique in that they actually had a living alternate as a point of reference. Pope Benedict XVI lived as a pope emeritus in the Vatican Gardens for the first decade of Francis\u2019 pontificate. The unprecedented anomaly of having a reigning and retired pope living together made the dynamics of the Francis opposition a first in Catholic history. It exacerbated longstanding divisions in the church that experts say must be addressed before any other pope decides to step down. They say norms are needed to regulate a papal resignation to prevent a retired pontiff from remaining a source of inspiration for those seeking to discredit his successor.",

His 2021 visit to Iraq, the first ever by a pope, had offered a rare moment of unity and hope after years of conflict and displacement. Just a few years before that, many Iraqi Christians had fled their homes as Islamic State militants swept across the country. During his visit to Iraq, Francis also held a historic meeting with the country\u2019s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.",

Cardinal Kevin Farrell is now in the spotlight. According to tradition, the camerlengo certifies the pope\u2019s death, seals the papal apartment and breaks the pope\u2019s fisherman\u2019s ring. He leads the procession accompanying the coffin into St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and presides over the burial. He also gets written reports from Vatican offices about their current assets; a copy of the current and projected budget for the Holy See; and any other information from the Vatican\u2019s economic ministry that would be useful for cardinals and the future pope.",

The administration's posture is meant to hold the line against Democratic demands for Hegseth\u2019s firing at a time when the Pentagon is engulfed in turmoil, including the departures of several senior aides. The White House has framed the revelation as the outgrowth of a power struggle between Hegseth and the career workforce. But some of the recently departed officials were brought in by Hegseth.",
