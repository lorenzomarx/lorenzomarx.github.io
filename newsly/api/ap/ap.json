A settlement announced Friday by the Justice Department means the federal government is ending a ban as part of a deal that also requires it to return seized devices. The settlement resolves a series of cases over the aftermarket trigger the government had previously argued qualify as machine guns under federal law.

As the U.S. president has jacked up tariffs, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for the taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses. Most economic analyses are deeply skeptical of those claims and have warned that the tariffs would worsen inflation, but Walmart warned on Thursday that everything from bananas to children\u2019s car seats could increase in price.",
