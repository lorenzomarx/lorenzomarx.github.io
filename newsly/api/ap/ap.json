      "description": "Forced leaves have begun in Washington and worldwide for most employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Under a Trump administration plan, the agency is to be left with fewer than 300 workers out of many thousands. The leaves at USAID started Friday. Federal workers associations have turned to the courts to try to roll back orders dismantling most of the agency and U.S.- funded aid programs around the world. It's not clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what Trump administration says is a review of the aid and development programs it wants to resume.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's administration has ordered all federal departments and agencies to provide lists of employees who are underperforming. The memo was sent Thursday as the administration seeks to shrink the workforce and awaits a court ruling related to its deferred resignation offers. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management directs the agencies to submit names of every employee who has received less than a \u201cfully successful\u201d performance rating in the past three years and to note whether the workers have been on performance plans. That data is due March 7.",

The agenda is taken largely from his \u201cAgenda 47\u201d campaign proposals, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 and other hard-right influencers with juice in Trump\u2019s White House. But between Trump and his allies, there is still a to-do list. It includes goals like shuttering the Department of Education, remaking U.S. higher education, loosening federal labor law and pursuing sweeping tax and trade legislation on Capitol Hill. Trump allies also want to restrict medication abortions. And the president still hasn't delivered on his promise to end wars in Ukraine and Israel.",

      "description": "For transgender Americans, passports just became a lot more complicated. President Donald Trump issued an executive order saying there are two sexes, male and female, and rejecting the idea that people can transition to a gender identify different from the one assigned at birth. The passport policy is among several actions Trump has taken since returning to office that could stifle rights and legal recognition of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people. Transgender people have reported having requests to change the gender marker on their passports denied and being asked to swear to a sex assigned at birth rather than the gender they live as. Several transgender people are challenging the order in court.",

The plane crashed on its way to the hub community of Nome on Thursday afternoon, killing everyone on board. As the community tried to process the deadly event Friday, crews worked swiftly on unstable, slushy ice to recover the dead passengers and aircraft with less than a day before the bad weather was expected. Officials said a Black Hawk helicopter would be used to move the wreckage.",
