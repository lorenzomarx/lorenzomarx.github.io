The Maryland construction worker became the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous. A judge in Tennessee determined that Abrego Garcia wasn\u2019t a danger or flight risk. He was released from jail on Friday. The Trump administration has said it will try to deport him before his trial.",

He was arrested in Texas last year. Prosecutors say that under the leadership of Zambada and Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, the Sinaloa cartel evolved from a regional player into the world\u2019s largest drug trafficking organization.",
