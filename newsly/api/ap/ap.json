The Egyptian official said 50 Palestinians would cross in each direction in the first day of the crossing\u2019s operation. The official, involved in talks related the implementation of ceasefire deal, spoke to the AP anonymously to discuss confidential information. State-run Egyptian media and an Israeli security official also confirmed the opening. The current ceasefire has halted more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas that began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",

      "description": "House Speaker Mike Johnson faces tough days ahead trying to pass a federal funding package and prevent a prolonged partial government shutdown. Democrats are demanding changes to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement operations after the deaths in Minneapolis. But Republicans are making their own demands in support of President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. A partial shutdown started over the weekend when funding lapsed for several agencies. Trump struck a deal with senators, who approved new funding, but only temporarily for Homeland Security until Feb. 13. That would give Congress time to consider new restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Johnson now needs Trump to help push that deal through the House.",

Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican and conservative activist Leigh Wambsganss in the Fort Worth-area district. His victory added to Democrats\u2019 record of overperforming in special elections so far this cycle. Trump used his social media platform to urge voters to support Wambsganss, but Rehmet had support from national organizations. The victory allows Rehmet to serve only until early January, and he must win the November general election to keep the seat after that.",
