      "description": "When Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he laid off thousands of employees, stopped paying rent and auctioned off coffee makers and office chairs in hopes of a big turnaround. Now the world\u2019s richest man has brought the same slash-and-burn strategy to the federal government. Some people who experienced Musk\u2019s takeover at Twitter have a warning: Expect chaos, cuts driven by ideology as much as by cost concerns, intimidation and plenty of lawsuits. Since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has consolidated control over large swaths of the government, sidelined career officials, gained access to sensitive databases and invited a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",

      "description": "Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst has hailed Elon Musk and the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. So has Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. Their constituents are following the cost-cutting effort closely. Unlike their top elected officials, several of them are expressing concerns. Some question the delivery of government services or whether Musk has the necessary authority. Others back Musk, saying his action is needed given the risk of doing nothing to sharply curb federal spending.",

      "description": "Democrats are opposing Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency as it turns its attention to the Education Department, with lawmakers raising questions about DOGE\u2019s access to internal systems containing personal information on tens of millions of Americans. A group of Democrats tells the acting education secretary it's seeking to intervene as DOGE appears to gain increasing access to student loan databases. Democrats fear it could lay the groundwork for a takeover akin to Musk\u2019s attempt to close the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Democrats want details about DOGE\u2019s work and vow to fight any attempt to close of the Education Department. The Republican president has set out to abolish the department.",

Thirteen attorneys general, including New York\u2019s Letitia James, said in a statement issued Thursday that they were taking action in defense of the Constitution, people's right to privacy and essential funding that individuals and communities are counting on. Government officials and labor unions have been among those raising concerns about DOGE\u2019s involvement with the payment system for the federal government.

And President Donald Trump says he's endorsing Vance's view. The Wall Street Journal reported that 25-year-old DOGE employee Marko Elez resigned Thursday after the newspaper linked him to a deleted social media account on X. Posts on the account included statements that \u201cI was racist before it was cool\u201d and \u201cYou could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.\u201d Vance, in a post on Musk-owned X, said Elez should be brought back and blamed \u201cjournalists who try to destroy people.\u201d",

      "description": "Forced leaves have begun in Washington and worldwide for most employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Under a Trump administration plan, the agency is to be left with fewer than 300 workers out of many thousands. The leaves at USAID started Friday. Federal workers associations have turned to the courts to try to roll back orders dismantling most of the agency and U.S.- funded aid programs around the world. It's not clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what Trump administration says is a review of the aid and development programs it wants to resume.",

      "description": "Recent aviation disasters and close calls definitely have people worried about the safety of flying. The midair collision that killed 67 near Washington and the fiery plane crash in Philadelphia and now a missing plane in Alaska are only the most high-profile disasters. There was also a plane that clipped a parked plane while taxiing at the Seattle airport earlier this week and a United Airlines plane that caught fire during takeoff at the Houston airport. But even with all these incidents the statistics show that flying remains the safest form of transportation compared with driving or even riding on a train.",

The NATO-nation military officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the fire and radio transmission that Russian authorities haven\u2019t publicly reported. The officials said a NATO-nation ship recorded the radio exchanges involving the Russian eavesdropping vessel Kildin. The audio provides an unusual peek inside Russia\u2019s fleet of spy ships that NATO nations are watching closely. A retired French vice admiral said the blaze highlights logistical difficulties for Russia of maintaining naval forces in the Mediterranean.",
