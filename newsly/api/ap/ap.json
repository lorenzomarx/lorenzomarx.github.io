      "description": "European Union leaders are appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to defend their security interests at a key summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. The Europeans are desperate to exert some influence over a meeting that they have been sidelined from. It's unclear whether whether even Ukraine will take part. Trump says he wants to see on Friday whether Putin is serious about ending the war. But he has disappointed U.S. allies by saying that Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. In a statement early Tuesday, the EU leaders welcomed his efforts to end the war, but insisted that \u201cthe path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d",

      "description": "Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has responded to President Donald Trump's plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard. Bowser emphasized that crime has been dropping and Trump's state of emergency doesn't match the numbers. She acknowledged that the city has little choice but to comply. Bowser linked the takeover to the larger issue of D.C. statehood, stating that limited autonomy makes the city vulnerable. Trump's decision fits a pattern of using emergency declarations to rule by executive order. Bowser maintains that violent crime has decreased, a claim supported by Trump's former U.S. attorney nominee.",

      "description": "Texas Republican leaders say they're prepared to end their stalemated legislative special session and immediately begin another standoff with Democrats in the GOP\u2019s efforts to redraw congressional maps as directed by President Donald Trump. Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows confirmed the plans Tuesday during a brief session that marked another failure to meet the required attendance standards. Dozens of Democrats have left the state and left the GOP majority unable to move forward with its gerrymandering attempt. Burrows said lawmakers will not reconvene again until Friday. If Democrats are still absent, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he will end the current session and will call another.",

      "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has expressed pride in being part of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, a conservative Christian network. Hegseth recently shared a CNN video about the church, showing its pastors arguing women should not have the right to vote. Hegseth is among President Donald Trump\u2019s most controversial Cabinet picks and attends a CREC church in Tennessee. The church network has connections to Christian nationalism and practices complementarianism, emphasizing traditional gender roles. Network co-founder Pastor Doug Wilson leads the flagship Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, and is known for his hard-line theology and patriarchal views. A Pentagon spokesman says Hegseth appreciates many of Wilson\u2019s writings and teachings.",

      "description": "U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago. The figures suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday\u2019s figures likely include some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.",

      "description": "Asian shares are mostly higher after President Donald Trump delayed raising tariffs on China for another 90 days. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 reached a new record high. Trump signed an executive order putting on hold a possible showdown between the world\u2019s two major economies, to allow time for talks. Without an extension, taxes on Chinese imports might have jumped from an already high 30%. Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China but it issued a similar statement about the extension of the tariff pause. U.S. stocks edged back from record highs. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, the Dow industrials fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.3%.",
