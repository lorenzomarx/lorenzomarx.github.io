      "description": "A senior Kremlin official says clinching a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cis far too complex to be done quickly.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov's comments Wednesday came as the U.S. labors to bring momentum to peace efforts and expresses frustration over the slow progress. Officials, meanwhile, said that a nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city of Kharkiv wounded at least 45 civilians. The United Nations reported that the number of Ukrainian civilian casualties in the more than three-year war has surged in recent weeks. Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin backs calls for a ceasefire \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances.\u201d",

      "description": "Chief Justice John Roberts appears to hold the key vote over whether the Supreme Court will allow the nation\u2019s first publicly funded religious charter school, in Oklahoma. Roberts was the only justice whose vote seemed in doubt after the court heard more than two hours of arguments Wednesday in a major culture-war clash involving the separation of church and state. Four other conservative justices seemed firmly on the side of the St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School and the state charter school board that approved it. The three liberal justices seemed just as likely to vote to affirm an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling that held that the taxpayer-funded school would entangle church and state in violation of the First Amendment.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has gotten worrisome news about how the U.S. economy is battening down for potential fallout from his tariffs. And the Republican president is trying to blame Democrat Joe Biden, who left office months ago. The government reported Wednesday the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% during the first three months of the year. Behind the decline was a surge in imports as companies tried to front-run Trump's sweeping tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and almost every country. After stocks sold off Wednesday morning, Trump said it's not his stock market, it's Biden's. A former Biden aide says Trump has taken the U.S. economy from strong, stable growth to negative GDP.",

It brings to nearly two dozen the total number freed from Kuwait in the past two months. Taken together, the pardons of 23 Americans since March \u2014 done as a goodwill gesture by a U.S. ally \u2014 amounted to the largest release of U.S. citizens by a single foreign country in years. Ten others were released on March 12, weeks after a visit to Kuwait by Adam Boehler, who is serving as the Trump administration\u2019s envoy for hostage affairs. The releases weren't done as part of a swap and the U.S. wasn't asked to give up anything in return.",
