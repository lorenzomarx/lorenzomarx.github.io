He asserts that \u201cour goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza.\u201d He is also pushing back against what he calls a \u201cglobal campaign of lies\u201d as condemnation of the plan grows both inside and outside Israel.

      "description": "Police in London are bracing for more demonstrations on Sunday as the war in Gaza continues to inflame tensions across the U.K. Demonstrators plan to march to the prime minister\u2019s residence, demanding the release of hostages in Gaza. The march organizers emphasize the humanitarian aspect of their demand for the hostages\u2019 release, saying it\u2019s not a political issue. This follows the arrest of 474 people on Saturday at a protest supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group. The group, Palestine Action, was banned after activists damaged military planes. Supporters are challenging the ban in court.",

      "description": "The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow\u2019s uncompromising demands in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. President Donald Trump to coerce Kyiv into accepting an unfavorable deal. The maximalist demands reflect Putin\u2019s determination to reach the goals he set when he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin sees a meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia\u2019s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.",

This comes before a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Trump has said the meeting in Alaska is to discuss ending the war, which has lasted over three years. European leaders have expressed concerns that Kyiv might be pressured into giving up land. A statement from European leaders stresses the need for a \"just and lasting peace\" for Ukraine. Trump has also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia if no settlement is reached.",

She was one of at least 12,000 refugees who had imminent travel plans canceled. Many of them had already sold belongings in anticipation of resettlement. A lawsuit brought by refugee aid groups and a handful of individuals, including the Congolese woman, is still playing out in the courts. The Congolese woman made it to the U.S. earlier this year thanks to a narrow window created by a court ruling that was later overturned. But thousands of refugees remain in limbo.",

With Senate confirmation, they'd have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House. Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump\u2019s second term, an Associated Press review finds at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any nominees support increased access to abortion.",
