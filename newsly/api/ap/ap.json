      "description": "Japan\u2019s meteorological agency says that a powerful earthquake has hit near Russia\u2019s Kamchatka Peninsula and issued a tsunami advisory for Japan. The agency said the quake registered a preliminary magnitude of 8.0 when it hit early on Wednesday. It issued an advisory for a tsunami of up to 1 meter (yard) along the Pacific coast of Japan. The quake was about 250 kilometers (160 miles) away from Hokkaido and was felt only slightly. That's according to Japan\u2019s NHK television. So far no damage has been reported. A tsunami watch, which is a relatively low-level warning, has been issued for Hawaii.",

      "description": "A powerful earthquake that struck off the coast of Russia has generated tsunami warnings and advisories for a broad section of the Pacific, including Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake registered a magnitude of 8.8 and was centered off the coast of Kamchatka peninsula. If you get a tsunami warning, move to higher ground if you are in a tsunami hazard zone. Some communities have buildings designated as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school. Others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside.",

      "description": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams says that a gunman who killed four people at a Manhattan office building was trying to target the headquarters of the National Football League but took the wrong elevator. Investigators believe Shane Tamura was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building\u2019s lobby but accidentally entered the wrong set of elevator banks, Adams said in interviews on Tuesday. Four people, including an off-duty New York City police officer, were killed. Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested he had a grievance against the NFL over an unsubstantiated claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy.",

      "description": "The man who killed four people in the New York City skyscraper that is home to NFL headquarters carried a note blaming the league for the cognitive problems he developed as a high school football player. Shane Tamura said in the three-page note found in his wallet that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can\u2019t be diagnosed until death, and implored those who found him to study his brain. CTE has been linked to concussions in contact sports. The disease has been diagnosed in more than 100 former NFL players and arisen as an existential threat to the United States\u2019 most powerful pro sports league.",

Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to abuse underage girls, has requested questions in advance and wants any interview scheduled after her Supreme Court petition is resolved. The House Oversight Committee, however, has stated it will not consider offering her immunity. Maxwell's lawyers have also urged the Supreme Court to review her conviction, claiming she did not receive a fair trial. They suggest she might testify openly if pardoned by former President Trump.",

Yet this authority \u2014 the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC \u2014 stopped short Tuesday of formally declaring a famine. Even though Israel eased a 2 1/2-month blockade on the territory in May, aid groups say only a trickle of assistance is getting into the enclave and that Palestinians face catastrophic levels of hunger. Still, the IPC has not yet obtained data that would meet its threshold for declaring a famine in Gaza.",

Combs was acquitted of the most serious federal charges he faced, but convicted of lesser prostitution-related offenses. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, argued on Tuesday that conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn are dangerous. Agnifilo noted that others convicted of similar offenses were typically released before sentencing. In July, Combs was denied bail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges.
