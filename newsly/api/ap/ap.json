      "description": "Federal regulators repeatedly granted appeals to remove Camp Mystic\u2019s buildings from their 100-year flood map, as the camp operated and expanded in a dangerous flood plain in the years before rushing waters swept away children and counselors. The Federal Emergency Management Agency included the prestigious camp for girls in a \u201cSpecial Flood Hazard Area\u201d in its National Flood Insurance map for Kerr County in 2011, which means it was required to have flood insurance and faced tighter regulation on any future construction projects. But in map amendments in 2013, 2019 and 2020, FEMA granted appeals to remove 30 Camp Mystic structures from the map. The amendments shielded buildings at the original site, as well as at a second camp site.",

Critics say some of these initiatives are nothing new or duplicative, while some governors are using their DOGE vehicles to target welfare programs or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The state initiatives have a markedly different character than Trump\u2019s slash-and-burn approach. Steve Slivinski of the libertarian Cato Institute says much of what he's seen is the same mundane stuff states routinely do to save money. Analysts at the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute say some governors and lawmakers are using DOGE agendas to consolidate power.",

In May, the PKK announced it would heed jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's calls to formally disarm and disband.",
