      "description": "Texas Democrats have left the state in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. The dramatic move Sunday could expose Democrats to fines and other penalties. Democrats have cast the decision to leave the state as a last-ditch effort to stop Republicans from pushing through a rare mid-decade redrawing of the congressional map. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature that started last month to take up the redistricting effort that President Donald Trump has urged.",

      "description": "California Democrats are weighing new political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state while bolstering Democratic incumbents in other battleground districts. The tentative proposal comes in response to plans by Texas Republicans to redraw House districts and strengthen the GOP hold on the chamber in 2026. According to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, the map aims to boost the Democratic margin to 48 seats out of California\u2019s 52 congressional districts, up from the 43 seats the party now holds.",

      "description": "The monthly jobs report is already closely-watched on Wall Street and in Washington but has taken on a new importance after President Donald Trump on Friday fired the official who oversees it. Trump claimed that June\u2019s employment figures were \u201cRIGGED\u201d to make him and other Republicans \u201clook bad\u201d yet provided no evidence. The firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics director followed Friday\u2019s jobs report that showed hiring was weak in July and had come to nearly a standstill in May and June. Economists and Wall Street investors have long considered the job figures reliable. Friday\u2019s revisions were unusually large, and the surveys used to compile the report are facing challenges from declining response rates. But that hasn\u2019t led most economists to doubt them.",

It's a move that may make the process unaffordable for many. In a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the department says it will start a 12-month pilot program under which people from countries deemed to have high overstay rates and deficient internal document security controls could be required to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 when they apply for a visa. It says the countries affected will be listed once the program takes effect.",

Families of hostages in Gaza fear starvation affects them too, but blame Hamas. The U.N. says several hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since May while seeking food aid.",

Starting in 2013, a wasting disease caused a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species. The sunflower sea star was worst hit, losing around 90% of its population. Researchers have identified the culprit as a bacterium that also infects shellfish. The findings, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, could help scientists intervene to save sea stars. This is crucial for Pacific ecosystems, as healthy starfish control sea urchin populations that threaten kelp forests.",
