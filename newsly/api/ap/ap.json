      "description": "Justice Department officials will meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned girlfriend of financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. That's according to a person familiar with the matter. The person tells The Associated Press the meeting is Thursday in Florida, where Maxwell is held. The meeting is part of a Justice Department effort to cast itself as transparent following backlash from parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s base over an earlier refusal to release additional Epstein records. A Justice Department spokesman hasn't returned a message seeking comment. A lawyer for Maxwell says she'll \"always testify truthfully.\u201d Maxwell was convicted of helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Epstein died in a New York jail awaiting trial.",

      "description": "The revelation that Attorney General Pam Bondi told President Donald Trump that his name was in the Jeffrey Epstein files has focused fresh attention on the president\u2019s relationship with the wealthy financier and the Justice Department\u2019s announcement this month that it would not be releasing any additional documents from the case. But at least some of the information in the briefing to Trump, which The Wall Street Journal said took place in May, should not have been a surprise. His association with Epstein is well-established and his name was included in records that his own Justice Department released back in February. Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump plans to visit the Federal Reserve as his allies scrutinize its expensive building renovations. It's a highly personal and confrontational escalation of Trump's campaign to pressure the central bank to slash interest rates. Trump administration officials have used concerns about the Washington building overhaul to cast doubt on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s decision making. The Trump administration officials are scheduled to inspect the site Thursday. The White House says the Republican president will also be visiting. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the chair has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3%. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

But it isn\u2019t the gilded version that the Republican is currently using. Instead, it's a mirror image of the Oval Office from Trump's first term. The replica initially looked like Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s office when the White House Historical Association opened \u201cThe People\u2019s House\" educational center last fall. It takes time to get copies made of every item in the real Oval Office. It will be fully revamped next year to mirror Trump's second-term office.

The federal public defenders had asked to be taken off the case, saying Routh had refused repeated attempts to meet with them.

That's a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns. And it's impossible to know the full extent of the problem. That's because the parks commonly aren\u2019t identified in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s national database of drinking water violations.
