Israel\u2019s military said it fired warning shots at people who approached its forces Sunday. The sites are run by an Israeli and U.S.-backed group. The past two weeks have seen frequent shootings near the new hubs where thousands of Palestinians are directed to collect food. Many are desperate after 20 months of war. The sites are inside Israeli military zones where independent media have no access. Gaza's Health Ministry says in all, at least 108 bodies were brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Israel says it identified Hamas chief Mohammed Sinwar\u2019s body, who was killed last month.",

Yet state and local officials say it\u2019s time to free Concordia Parish and other districts from court-ordered desegregation orders dating back decades. In a stunning shift that reverses decades of policy, they have allies in the federal government. The Trump administration has vowed to lift more desegregation plans from the 1960s.

Smartphones and other mobile devices present significant national security and cybersecurity risks, as foreign government hackers exploit vulnerabilities in mobile networks and apps to spy on people and steal secrets. And people's careless use of mobile devices to share sensitive information is another concern. National security experts say that mobile security hasn't kept up as mobile devices and networks have proliferated, making them a significant vulnerability in the nation's cyber defenses.",
