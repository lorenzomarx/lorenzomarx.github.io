      "description": "Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv are holding a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi to end their war. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power grid and after a rise in civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging allies to pressure Moscow to end the invasion, which began in 2022. He emphasizes the need for security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks. Fighting continues alongside the talks, with Russia targeting Ukraine\u2019s electricity network. Human Rights Watch reports a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties last year. Almost 15,000 civilians have been killed since the war began.",

      "description": "A judge says U.S. immigration agents in Oregon must stop arresting people without warrants unless they are likely to escape. U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai issued the preliminary injunction Wednesday. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by a nonprofit law firm representing a man who was detained by immigration officers without a warrant despite having a valid work permit. In a memo last week, the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement emphasized that agents should not make arrests without an administrative arrest warrant issued by a supervisor unless they develop probable cause to believe the person is likely to escape from the scene.",

Both sides accuse the other of violations, even as they continue to push ahead with the fragile process. At least 556 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since the U.S.-brokered truce came into effect, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza in the same period, with more injured, including a soldier who was severely wounded overnight. Little progress has been made on larger issues concerning Gaza's future.",

All of these things appeared in the mountain of documents released publicly by the U.S. Justice Department as part of its effort to comply with a law requiring it to open its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information.

The assaults on Tuesday evening targeted the villages of Woro and Nuku in Kwara state. Amnesty International reported over 170 deaths, criticizing a \"stunning security failure.\" Nigeria faces a complex security crisis with Islamic militants and criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits,\" expanding their reach. No group has claimed responsibility, but local officials suspect extremist groups. The attacks coincide with increased U.S. military support to Nigeria, aimed at addressing the country's escalating security challenges.",

The end of the New START Treaty could lead to an unconstrained nuclear arms race. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed readiness to stick to the treaty\u2019s limits for another year if the U.S. agreed, but U.S. President Donald Trump has been noncommittal. On Wednesday, Putin discussed the expiration with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Russia's Foreign Ministry stated that both countries are now free to choose their next steps. The treaty, signed in 2010, was extended in 2021 but inspections stopped in 2020.",
