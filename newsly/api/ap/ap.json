      "description": "President Donald Trump suffered a rare rebuke when the Supreme Court ruled against his tariff agenda. The decision Friday throws U.S. trade policy back into uncertainty. Trump has built his economic message around tariffs and the deals that he says they force. He argues they bring factories and jobs back. He also warns that losing them harms the economy. Trump called the ruling \u201cridiculous\u201d and said he is looking for other laws to keep tariffs in place. Democrats say the decision proves Trump broke the law. Polling from AP-NORC finds that most adults oppose tariffs and expect higher prices.",

It had been flipping between small gains and losses before the court\u2019s ruling, following discouraging reports showing slowing growth for the U.S. economy and faster inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%. Trading was tentative across markets after the ruling and after Trump pledged to put tariffs on other countries using other avenues. Treasury yields largely held steady in the bond market.",
