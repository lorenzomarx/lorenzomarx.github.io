      "description": "New trade penalties against Canada, Mexico and China that President Donald Trump plans to impose represent an aggressive early move against America\u2019s three largest trading partners, but at the risk of higher inflation and possible disruptions to the global economy. In Trump\u2019s view, the 25% tariffs against the two North American allies and a 10% tax on imports from Washington\u2019s chief economic rival are a way for the United States to throw around its financial heft to reshape the world. The Republican president is making a major political bet with this expected move on Saturday that his actions won't worsen inflation, cause financial aftershocks that could destabilize the worldwide economy or provoke a voter backlash.",

      "description": "Tariffs are in the news at the moment. But what are they? Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump said this week that tariffs on U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico will arrive Saturday. The two nations are not only close geographically, but economically as well. The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023. That is far greater than the $643 billion in commerce that the U.S. did with China in that same year. Following are just a few imported goods that could be hit first.",

Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20.

That's according to a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
