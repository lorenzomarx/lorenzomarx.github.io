      "description": "A key House committee is looking into the investigation of the late Jeffrey Epstein for sex trafficking crimes. It is working to subpoena President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice for files in the case as well as hold a deposition of Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee\u2019s actions show the mounting pressure for disclosure in a case that Trump has urged his supporters to move past. But they were also just the start of what can be a drawn out process.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has played golf at his course on Scotland\u2019s coast while protesters around the country took to the streets to decry his visit and accuse United Kingdom leaders of pandering to the American. Trump and his son Eric played on Saturday near Turnberry, a historic course that the Trump family\u2019s company took over in 2008. Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate about 100 miles away in Edinburgh, Scotland\u2019s capital. Protests are planned in other cities. While in Scotland, Trump is set to talk trade with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president.",

It\u2019s an astonishing figure, but still subject to negotiation and perhaps not the sure thing he\u2019s portraying. He says 90% of any profits from the money invested would go to the U.S. even if Japan had put up the funds. He calls it \u201ca signing bonus.\u201d A key Japanese trade negotiator isn't discussing the terms. It's unclear the degree to which the $550 billion could represent new investment or flow into existing investment plans.",

The majority of people were killed by gunfire waiting for aid trucks close to the Zikim crossing with Israel, officials said Saturday. The strikes come as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have hit a standstill after the U.S and Israel recalled their negotiating teams this week throwing the future of the negotiations into further uncertainty. The United Nations and experts say that Palestinians in Gaza are at risk of famine, with reports of increasing numbers of people dying from causes related to malnutrition.",

The body of 5-month-old Zainab Abu Halib arrived at a hospital in southern Gaza on Friday and her family buried her on Saturday.

The baby vomited and had diarrhea and ended up with sepsis, unable to swallow. Doctors and aid workers in Gaza blame the growing hunger on Israel\u2019s restrictions on the entry of aid.",

Now, Texas Republicans want to break that tradition. And other states could follow suit. President Trump has asked the Texas Legislature to create districts, in time for next year\u2019s midterm elections, that will send five more Republicans to Washington and make it harder for Democrats to regain the majority and blunt his agenda. There's no national impediment to a state trying to redraw districts in the middle of a decade and to do it for political reasons, such as increasing representation by the party in power.",

In Kentucky, there is limited restroom access for women in the Statehouse, who risk missing debates or votes if they have to stand in line to answer the call of nature. A $300 million renovation, expected to be finished by at least 2028, will add more bathrooms for women. Similar efforts are underway in Georgia, reflecting a shift toward inclusivity. Historically, many statehouses were built without considering female legislators. Advocates say these changes symbolize a shift toward respect and equality, ensuring public spaces meet the needs of all lawmakers and the public.",
