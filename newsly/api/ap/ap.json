The FBI immediately called it a \u201ctargeted terror attack.\u201d Officials said the man yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d as he attacked people Sunday calling for the immediate release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. The FBI identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman. Charges were not immediately filed against him, but officials said they expect to hold him \u201cfully accountable.\u201d",

Expectations are low for any significant progress Monday on ending the three-year war after a string of major attacks over the weekend. Ukraine said Sunday it launched a spectacular surprise attack on five Russian airbases thousands of kilometers apart, ranging from air bases close to Moscow to targets in Russia\u2019s Arctic, Siberia, and Far East. Ukraine claimed more than 40 Russian warplanes were destroyed in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called a \u201cbrilliant operation.\u201d Meanwhile, Russia on Sunday launched the biggest number of drones \u2014 472 \u2014 on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in February 2022.",

Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal say the U.S. Congress and Europe may have just two weeks to act. They spoke in Paris on Sunday in an Associated Press interview. Graham, a Republican, and Blumenthal, a Democrat, had just come from Kyiv, where they met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and visited neighborhoods destroyed in what they called the most intense bombardments since the war began. The senators are urging swift support for a sweeping sanctions bill to sever the economic lifeline fueling Russia\u2019s war.",

Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%. The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union. An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture hours later.",

It's designed to senf a message to Moscow \u2014 and Washington. The government is responding Monday to a strategic defence review , led by former NATO Secretary General George Robertson, that it says is the most consequential since the end of the Cold War. Prime MInister Keir Starmer says Britain faces greater threats than it has for many years. He said U.K. defense spending will hit 2.5% of GDP by 2027. But a goal of 3% before 2034 is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise.",

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised. The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add $5.1 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if they are allowed to continue. That's according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",
