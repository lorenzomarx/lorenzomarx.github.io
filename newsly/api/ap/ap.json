      "description": "Newly disclosed government files on Jeffrey Epstein show authorities thought they were close to indicting the wealthy financier on sex crimes nearly two decades ago, before that investigation was suddenly scrapped. Other documents in Friday\u2019s release include Epstein\u2019s communications with former White House advisers, an NFL team co-owner and billionaires including Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The Justice Department said it would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. Disclosures are resuming under a law intended to reveal what the government knew about his sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with rich and powerful people.",

      "description": "Britain\u2019s royal family is facing a fresh round of embarrassment after the latest release of documents from the U.S. investigation into Jeffrey Epstein revealed unsavory details about the relationship between the convicted sex offender and a correspondent who appears to be the man formerly known as Prince Andrew. Emails released by the U.S. Justice Department include an invitation for Epstein to dine at Buckingham Palace, Epstein\u2019s offer to introduce his correspondent to a 26-year-old Russian woman, and photos that appear to show Andrew kneeling over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The revelations come three months after King Charles III stripped Andrew of his royal titles, including the right to be called a prince.",

      "description": "A federal judge says she won\u2019t halt the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota and the Twin Cities as a lawsuit over it proceeds. Judge Katherine M. Menendez on Saturday denied a preliminary injunction sought in a lawsuit filed this month by state Attorney General Keith Ellison and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. It argued that the Department of Homeland Security is violating constitutional protections. The lawsuit sought a quick order to halt the enforcement action or limit its scope. Lawyers with the U.S. Department of Justice have called the lawsuit \u201clegally frivolous.\u201d Federal officers have fatally shot two people on the streets of Minneapolis: Renee Good on Jan. 7 and Alex Pretti on Jan. 24.",

Images of preschooler Liam Conejo Ramos in a bunny hat and Spiderman backpack being surrounded by federal agents in a Minneapolis suburb on Jan. 20 added to the outcry about the immigration actions of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The government says the father and son, originally from Ecuador, entered the U.S. in 2024. They were taken to a detention facility in Dilley, Texas.

The strikes hit northern and southern Gaza, including an apartment in Gaza City and a tent in Khan Younis, officials at the Nasser and Shifa Hospitals said. The casualties included two women and six children from two different families. Israel\u2019s military did not immediately respond to questions about the strikes. The strikes came a day before a border crossing is set to open in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, a reminder that the death poll is still rising even as a ceasefire agreement inches forward.",

      "description": "The partial government shutdown is a lot different from the record-long shutdown in the fall. That's mostly because the shutdown that began Saturday may not last long. When the House returns on Monday, lawmakers will try to pass legislation quickly that would end the shutdown. Congress has passed half this year\u2019s funding bills, and that means several important federal agencies and programs continue to operate. Nutrition assistance programs should be unaffected. But funding is lapsing, at least temporarily, for the Pentagon and agencies such as the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation. Essential functions will continue, but workers could go without pay if the impasse drags on.",

Ukraine\u2019s Energy Minister, Denys Shmyhal, said that the outages had been caused by a technical malfunction affecting several power lines. The shortages follow weeks of Russian strikes against Ukraine\u2019s already struggling energy grid, which have already triggered long stretches of severe power shortages. Moscow has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as \u201cweaponizing winter.\u201d",
