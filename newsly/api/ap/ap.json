      "description": "The jury in Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial is set to resume deliberations. The jury reached a verdict Tuesday on all but one of the five counts the hip-hop mogul faces. Judge Arun Subramanian ordered the jury to continue deliberating for a third day on Wednesday. The jury said Tuesday it was unable to reach consensus on the top charge of racketeering conspiracy. It indicated it had already decided about other charges, including sex trafficking. Subramanian, prosecutors and Combs\u2019 defense team said less than 13 hours of deliberations was too soon to give up on reaching a verdict on all counts. The jury's partial verdict remains under wraps for now.",

      "description": "More than two years after the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students shocked the rural community of Moscow, Idaho, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders is expected in court Wednesday to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty. Brian Kohberger agreed to the plea deal in the past few days, just weeks before his trial was to begin, after his attorneys tried but failed to have execution stricken as a possible punishment. The deal drew mixed reactions from the victims' families, ranging from support to outrage that Kohberger would live.",

      "description": "House Republicans are sprinting toward a vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cuts package. The Republicans are looking to seize momentum from a hard-fought vote in the Senate, essentially daring members with concerns to defy Trump and vote against it. The bill will extend and make permanent various individual and business tax breaks Republicans passed in Trump\u2019s first term, plus temporarily add new tax breaks, such as no income taxes on tips and overtime. The House already passed one version of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It's unclear if House Republicans will be able to do the same with the Senate-amended version Wednesday.",

Two U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers\u2019 internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. The contractor who provided the videos said the bullets were fired in all directions \u2014 in the air, into the ground and at times towards the Palestinians. The testimonies offer a rare glimpse inside an often-chaotic scene at these sites.",

Wednesday's decision could throw into doubt one of the key pillars of the president\u2019s plans to crack down on immigration at the southern border. But the judge gave the Trump administration two weeks to appeal. In an executive order Jan. 20, Trump declared that the situation at the southern border was an invasion, and he was \u201csuspending the physical entry\u201d of migrants and their ability to seek asylum until he decides it is over.",

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says Wednesday that emergency crews and investigators are working with the property\u2019s owner and monitoring the area using drones to find the individuals. It's not immediately clear if those missing worked at the warehouse or lived nearby. People were urged to avoid the area for several days following the Tuesday night blast, which set off a barrage of fireworks and caused a huge blaze that led to other spot fires and collapsed the building in the farming community northwest of Sacramento.",

      "description": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban. The court\u2019s liberal majority ruled 4-3 on Wednesday that the ban is no longer valid because newer abortion restrictions superseded it. State lawmakers adopted the total ban in 1849. It was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nullified it, and was never repealed. Conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision overturning Roe reactivated the prohibition. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued, arguing that a 1985 state law that prohibits abortions after viability essentially repealed the ban.",

Tesla is also facing stiff competition from other electric vehicle makers, especially in Europe where China\u2019s BYD has taken a bite out of its market share. The 13% plunge in sales reported Wednesday adds to growing signs that Musk\u2019s embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe has had a deep and enduring impact to Tesla\u2019s brand appeal. Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same period last year.",
