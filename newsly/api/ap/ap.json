      "description": "Pope Francis has died. He was history\u2019s first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change. He was 88. The Vatican camerlengo made the announcement Monday. Francis suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man. He was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there. From his first greeting as pope of a simple \u201cGood evening\u201d to his embrace of refugees and the downtrodden, Francis signaled a very different tone for the papacy, stressing humility over hubris for a Catholic Church beset by scandal and accusations of indifference.",

Francis\u2019 death now sets off the process of allowing the faithful to pay their final respects.

The drama will unfold in a Washington D.C. courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the U.S. Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway.",
