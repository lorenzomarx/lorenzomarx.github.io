      "description": "President Donald Trump is again banning people from countries his administration deems dangerous from coming to America. The travel ban issued Wednesday is a repeat of an order of his first administration that led to widespread confusion at airports. This version includes Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The Republican president\u2019s first travel ban was issued in 2017 and banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. After legal challenges, the order was retooled until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump has said the initial ban was aimed at protecting the country.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have spoken amid stalled negotiations between their countries over tariffs that have roiled global trade. The Chinese foreign ministry says Trump initiated the call. The White House hasn't commented. The discussion Thursday followed Trump suggesting it was tough to reach a deal with Xi. Trump posted Wednesday on social media he likes Xi but Xi \u201cis VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d Trade negotiations between the United States and China stalled shortly after a May 12 agreement between both countries to reduce their tariff rates to have talks. Behind the gridlock has been the continued competition for an economic edge.",

The justices\u2019 decision Thursday affects lawsuits in 20 states and the District of Columbia where, until now, courts had set a higher bar when members of a majority group, including those who are white and heterosexual, sue for discrimination under federal law. The court ruled in an appeal from Marlean Ames, who's worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for years. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson says federal civil rights law draws no distinction between members of majority and minority groups.",
