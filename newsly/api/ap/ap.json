      "description": "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce announced Tuesday it was implementing counter tariffs against the U.S. on multiple products. The government said that it would implement 15% tariff on coal and liquified natural gas products, as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and certain vehicles. \u201cThe US\u2019s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.\u201d China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation also Tuesday said it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is holding off on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada for 30 days after the two U.S. neighbors agreed to boost border security efforts. Trump on Saturday had directed that 25% tariffs on most imports from the two American partners \u2014 and 10% on Canadian energy products \u2014 go into effect at midnight Tuesday. The two nations threatened retaliation of their own, raising the prospects of a broader regional trade war. In a statement on X, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that on a call with Trump he pledged additional cooperation on border security. It follows similar moves by Mexico earlier Monday. \u201cProposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together,\u201d Trudeau said.",

      "description": "One of the world\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances is broken. Canadians are absorbing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state. Canadians are feeling a sense of betrayal after Trump declared a trade war against America\u2019s northern neighbor and longtime ally. Trump keeps threatening Canada\u2019s sovereignty and vowing to put sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian products. The ties between the two countries are without parallel. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian, or US$2.5 billion, worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states and 77% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the United States.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has taken executive action to impose or threaten new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. The moves fulfill certain campaign promises but also have roiled stock markets and supply chains, while testing relations with the country\u2019s North American neighbors and, in China\u2019s case, the world\u2019s second-largest economy. But Trump is also declaring initial victories as Mexican and Canadian leaders agreed to more cooperation on border control. Unlike during the 2024 campaign, when Trump billed his economic agenda as guaranteed to reduce the cost of living for Americans, the Republican president now is acknowledging what many economists have long forecasted: that his approach could yield higher prices and lower supplies across a roiled U.S. market.",

Tuesday's White House meeting comes as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce and resume the war against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want to see remaining hostages come home and the 15-month war brought to an end. Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect on the day before he returned to power last month.",

Police have demanded help repelling the assault on Kenscoff that has killed at least 40 people. The mayor blamed the attack on the Viv Ansanm gang coalition and described gunmen going home to home and indiscriminately opening fire. Gangs already control 85% of Port-au-Prince, and the United Nations secretary-general warned last month they could overrun the capital. Gang violence has left more than 1 million people homeless across Haiti in recent years.",

Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York. The lawsuits accuse Gaiman\u2019s wife, Amanda Palmer, of introducing Pavlovich to Gaiman as the couple's babysitter in 2022 even though she knew he would sexually assault her. Online court records don't list an attorney for Gaiman but earlier this year he denied ever engaging in non-consensual sex. The Associated Press does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly as Pavlovich has done.",

The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort are causing a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty. And they're threatening to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year\u2019s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. The tariffs are set to launch on Tuesday.",
