      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to deliver remarks at Arlington National Cemetery to commemorate Memorial Day. Trump on Monday placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a somber tradition for U.S. presidents. Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth joined him. Trump began the day with a decidedly different tone. In an all-caps social media message, Trump ranted at former President Joe Biden, calling him the \u201cSCUM THAT SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.\" Trump also went after federal judges who have blocked efforts to enact his mass deportation agenda.",

      "description": "Ukrainian officials say that a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least twelve people and injuring dozens. The attack early on Sunday came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month which have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers on Saturday, a day after each released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Further releases were expected on Sunday.",

The city is still struggling to decide what should become of the intersection where Floyd met his demise, which has become a place of pilgrimage known as George Floyd Square. City leaders have not agreed on whether to close the intersection to all traffic as a permanent memorial. Minneapolis has also begun a remake of its police department under court supervision \u2014 an effort that the mayor and police chief say will continue with or without the backing of the Trump administration.",

Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government\u2019s agenda for the new Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies. Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the United States. He said the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",

Businesses increasingly have chosen to stay open on the holiday, leading to what is now one of the biggest retail sales and travel weekends of the year. Government offices, post offices and schools are closed, as is the stock market, banks and a handful of businesses. The vast majority of retailers will be open, with many trying to lure customers with big promotional sales.",
