That's because a backpack the suspect was wearing is sold exclusively at Walmart stores. Chris Nanos, the sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, told The Associated Press in a text message on Monday that the suspect's \u201cOzark Trail Hiker Pack\u201d is the only clothing item that has been \u201cdefinitively identified.\u201d Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie\u2019s front door the night she vanished.",

      "description": "Israeli prosecutors say they plan to charge a settler in the killing of a Palestinian activist during a confrontation that was caught on video. That would open a rare prosecution of violence by Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. Attacks from settlers and home demolitions by authorities have spiked dramatically over the past two years. But the death in July of Awdah Hathaleen has drawn particular attention due to his involvement in the 2025 Oscar-winning film \u201cNo Other Land.\u201d The case also stands out because the confrontation was captured on video from multiple vantage points.",
