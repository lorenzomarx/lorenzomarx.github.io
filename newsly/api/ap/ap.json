      "description": "Faith leaders and hundreds of supporters have gathered at a church in Springfield, Ohio, to support Haitian migrants fearing the end of their Temporary Protected Status in the U.S. The event Monday at St. John Missionary Baptist Church called for an extension of TPS, which is set to expire Tuesday. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to end TPS for about 500,000 Haitians, citing improved conditions in the Caribbean island country. The Springfield Haitian community remains anxious, fearing deportation and anti-immigrant sentiment. Many are staying home, stockpiling supplies and signing caregiver affidavits that might keep their children out of foster care if they themselves get detained or deported.",

Secretary Kristi Noem made the announcement Monday on the social media platform X. The news of the body cameras comes as Minneapolis has been the site of intense scrutiny over the conduct of immigration enforcement agents.

      "description": "House Speaker Mike Johnson faces tough days ahead trying to pass a federal funding package and prevent a prolonged partial government shutdown. Democrats are demanding changes to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement operations after the deaths in Minneapolis. But Republicans are making their own demands in support of President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. A partial shutdown started over the weekend when funding lapsed for several agencies. Trump struck a deal with senators, who approved new funding, but only temporarily for Homeland Security until Feb. 13. That would give Congress time to consider new restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Johnson now needs Trump to help push that deal through the House.",

The move comes after months after Trump pressing India to cut its reliance on cheap Russian crude.

Lawyers for victims said in a letter to the judge Sunday that botched redactions had damaged the lives of nearly 100 victims.

James Heaps was sentenced in 2023 to 11 years in prison for sexually abusing female patients. The court ruling on Monday ordered the case to be sent back for retrial. A three-justice panel from California\u2019s 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled Heaps was denied a fair trial because his defense counsel was not made aware of a note pointing out concerns that one juror lacked sufficient English to carry out their duties. Heaps was convicted in October 2022 of three counts of sexual battery by fraud and two counts of sexual penetration of two patients.",
