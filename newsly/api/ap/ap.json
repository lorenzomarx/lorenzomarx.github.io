The strikes killed at least 48 people in total, the Indonesian Hospital in Jabaliya reported.

Wednesday's meeting will come a day after Trump announced his plan to ease sanctions on Syria and normalize relations with its new government to give Syria \u201ca chance at peace\u201d under al-Sharaa. The former insurgent had been imprisoned in Iraq for his role in the insurgency following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of the Arab country. He was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by al-Sharaa\u2019s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, that stormed Damascus, ending the 54-year rule of the Assad family.",
