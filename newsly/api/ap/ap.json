      "description": "The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow\u2019s uncompromising demands in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. President Donald Trump to coerce Kyiv into accepting an unfavorable deal. The maximalist demands reflect Putin\u2019s determination to reach the goals he set when he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin sees a meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia\u2019s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.",

      "description": "European nations have rallied behind Ukraine, emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without Kyiv's involvement. This comes before a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Trump has said the meeting in Alaska is to discuss ending the war, which has lasted over three years. European leaders have expressed concerns that Kyiv might be pressured into giving up land. A statement from European leaders stresses the need for a \"just and lasting peace\" for Ukraine. Trump has also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia if no settlement is reached.",

      "description": "Police in London are bracing for more demonstrations on Sunday as the war in Gaza continues to inflame tensions across the U.K. Demonstrators plan to march to the prime minister\u2019s residence, demanding the release of hostages in Gaza. The march organizers emphasize the humanitarian aspect of their demand for the hostages\u2019 release, saying it\u2019s not a political issue. This follows the arrest of 474 people on Saturday at a protest supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group. The group, Palestine Action, was banned after activists damaged military planes. Supporters are challenging the ban in court.",

      "description": "Many of President Donald Trump's picks to be federal judges have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. With Senate confirmation, they'd have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House. Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump\u2019s second term, an Associated Press review finds at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any nominees support increased access to abortion.",

Michelle Bowman pointed to July's hiring slowdown, along with her belief that inflation is heading down toward 2% despite President Donald Trump's tariffs. She was one of two Fed officials who voted a week and a half ago in favor of lowering interest rates. They lost out as nine other Fed officials voted to keep rates steady. Lower rates can help the economy but can also fuel inflation.",

Their SpaceX capsule parachuted into the Pacific off the Southern California coast on Saturday, a day after departing the orbiting lab. Splashing down were two Americans, one Japanese and one Russian. They launched in March as the replacements for NASA\u2019s stuck astronauts. Boeing\u2019s botched Starliner demo kept the two test pilots at the space station for more than nine months instead of a week. This was SpaceX\u2019s third Pacific splashdown with people on board, but the first for a NASA crew in 50 years.",
