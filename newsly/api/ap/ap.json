      "description": "Russia launched 479 drones at Ukraine in the war\u2019s biggest overnight drone bombardment, the Ukrainian air force said. As well as the drones, 20 missiles of various types were fired at different parts of Ukraine, the air force said Monday. The attacks usually start late in the evening and end in the morning, because drones are harder to spot in the dark. Russia has targeted civilian areas of Ukraine with Shahed drones since the start of the war. The attacks have killed more that 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. A recent escalation in aerial attacks has coincided with a renewed Russian battlefield push on eastern and northeastern parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.",

      "description": "Thousands of protesters took to the street in Los Angeles on Sunday in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. The demonstrations centered on a cluster of federal buildings including a detention center where immigrants arrested on Friday were taken. As the protests swelled on Sunday, demonstrators blocked a freeway entrance, set self-driving cars on fire and threw objects including concrete and electric scooters at law enforcement officers and vehicles. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell says some of the protesters engaging in the most aggressive behavior are agitators looking to cause trouble.",
