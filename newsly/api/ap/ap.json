      "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Washington for a high-stakes meeting with President Donald Trump. Carney will have lunch with Trump before a bilateral meeting Tuesday. The new Canadian prime minster hopes to ease tensions in the trade war, which has created economic uncertainty on both sides of the border. Carney\u2019s Liberal Party scored a stunning comeback victory last month in a vote widely seen as a rebuke of Trump. The Republican president has shattered a decades-old alliance by saying he wants to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and levying steep tariffs. Carney has stressed Canada is \u201cin a once-in-a-lifetime crisis.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump told reporters he wasn\u2019t quite sure why Carney was visiting.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court is allowing President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to enforce a ban on transgender people in the military, while legal challenges proceed. The high court acted Tuesday in the dispute over a policy that presumptively disqualifies transgender people from military service. The court\u2019s three liberal justices said they would have kept the policy on hold. Just after beginning his second term in January, Trump moved aggressively to roll back the rights of transgender people. Among the Republican president\u2019s actions was an executive order that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life\u201d and is harmful to military readiness.",

      "description": "Pakistani security officials say that India fired missiles across the border into Pakistani-controlled territory in at least three locations early Wednesday, killing at a child and wounding two other people. India said it was striking infrastructure used by militants. The strikes came amid soaring tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors over last month\u2019s militant attack on tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the militant attack, which Islamabad has denied. The missiles early Wednesday struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country\u2019s eastern Punjab province, according to three Pakistani security officials.",

Merz had been expected to win smoothly in the vote on Tuesday. A candidate for chancellor has never failed to win on the first ballot in post-World War II Germany. Merz needed a majority of 316 out of 630 votes in a secret ballot but only received 310 votes. The lower house of parliament has 14 days to elect a candidate with an absolute majority.

      "description": "Cardinals electing a new pope have some fundamental questions to weigh, beyond whether to give the Catholic Church its first Asian or African pope. Despite hailing from 70 different countries, the 133 cardinals seem fundamentally united in finding a pope who will be able to make the 2,000-year-old church credible and relevant today, especially to young people. That's a tall task, given the sexual abuse and financials scandals that have sullied the church\u2019s reputation. Add to that the Holy See\u2019s dire financial state and often-dysfunctional bureaucracy, and the job of being pope in the 21st century seems almost impossible. As Cardinal William Seng Chye Goh of Singapore put it: \u201cWe need a superman!\u201d",
