      "description": "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press reveals that the agency allows immigration officers to forcibly enter homes to make arrests without a judicial warrant. This change reverses previous guidance and raises concerns about constitutional protections against illegal searches. The memo, signed by ICE\u2019s acting director, states that administrative warrants are sufficient for forced entry if there\u2019s a final order of removal. This policy could face legal challenges and criticism from advocacy groups. Whistleblower Aid, representing two government officials, describes the directive as seemingly unconstitutional and a significant shift in arrest powers. The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress.",

The government persuaded the appeals court to freeze a judge\u2019s ruling that bars officers from using tear gas and taking other steps against peaceful protesters in Minnesota\u2019s Twin Cities. The stay is in effect while the government appeals. Meanwhile, an official in Maine turned down a request for more undercover license plates for U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicles.

The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee approved the contempt of Congress charges in bipartisan votes. It sets up a potential vote in the House. Democrats were split on the measures. A number of progressive lawmakers called for full transparency in the Epstein investigation even if it meant threatening a former Democratic president if he refuses to testify.",

Adrian Gonzales had faced 29 charges of child abandonment and endangerment and up to two years in prison. A jury acquitted him Wednesday. Prosecutors had alleged at trial that Gonzales abandoned his training and could have stopped the gunman outside Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022. Gonzales\u2019 lawyers insisted he never saw the gunman before he entered the school. The trial was a rare prosecution of an officer for allegedly failing to act to stop a crime and protect lives.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court seems inclined to keep Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook in her job, casting doubt on President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to wrest control of the nation\u2019s central bank. The justices heard arguments Wednesday over Trump\u2019s effort to fire Cook based on allegations she committed mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a sitting governor in the 112-year history of the Fed, which was structured to be independent of day-to-day politics. The true motivation for trying to fire Cook, Trump\u2019s critics say, is the Republican president\u2019s desire to exert control over U.S. interest rate policy. Conservative and liberal justices voiced skepticism over Cook's firing.",

This week, warm Arctic waters and cold continental land are combining to send subzero temperatures, heavy snow, and ice across the eastern two-thirds of the country. The frigid conditions are expected to persist through January and into early February. Experts say the atmospheric pattern is set, with the potential for crippling ice and snow. The National Weather Service cautions about power outages and treacherous travel conditions. The Midwest and North could see temperatures as low as 30 degrees below zero.",

The announcement came after Israel said the makeup of the Board\u2019s Gaza executive body did not align with Israel\u2019s interests. A statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office said he had accepted Trump\u2019s invitation. The Board of Peace led by U.S. President Donald Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the Gaza ceasefire plan. The Trump administration\u2019s ambitions have ballooned into a more sprawling concept, with Trump extending invitations to dozens of nations and hinting it will soon broker global conflicts, like a pseudo-U.N. Security Council.",
