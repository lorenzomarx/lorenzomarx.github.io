      "description": "President Donald Trump says he\u2019s doubling the tariff rate on steel to 50%, a dramatic increase that could further push up prices for a metal used to make housing, autos and other goods. Trump made the announcement Friday at U.S. Steel\u2019s Mon Valley Works\u2013Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, where he announced investments by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel. The price of steel products has increased roughly 16% since Trump became president in January, according to the government\u2019s producer price index. Trump later added that aluminum tariffs would also be doubled to 50% and said both tariff hikes would go into effect Wednesday.",

Publicist Harlan Boll says Swit died Friday at her home in New York City, likely from natural causes.

The justices on Friday lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The court has also allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.",

The ceasefire plan, which has been approved by Israeli officials, won a cool initial reaction Thursday from the militant group. A Hamas official and an Egyptian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, said Thursday that the proposal called for a 60-day pause in fighting, guarantees of serious negotiations leading to a long-term truce and assurances that Israel will not resume hostilities after the release of hostages, as it did in March. In a terse statement, Hamas said it is holding consultations with Palestinian factions over the proposal.",

Despite that early failure, experts say bloodhounds are playing a key role in the search for Hardin, now in its sixth day. They have clothing and other items Hardin left behind, which is used to give the hounds the scent they will search for.",
