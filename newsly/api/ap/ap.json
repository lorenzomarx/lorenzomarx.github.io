Kyiv had benefited from years of staunch support by its allies in the United States and Europe which had provided crucial military and financial support to help defend against Moscow\u2019s grinding incursions. But when Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week \u2014 undoing years of U.S. policy to isolate the Russian leader \u2014 it was taken as a signal in Kyiv and other European capitals that their alliance to contain Moscow was fraying.",

General Assembly that stops far short of a competing European-backed statement demanding an immediate withdrawal of all of Moscow\u2019s forces from Ukraine.

David Maland died Jan. 20. It was the latest in a series of deaths tied to a cultlike group called the Zizians.
