      "description": "False and misleading social media posts are circulating online as the Trump administration moves to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development. They raise questions about funding for certain projects and organizations, often claiming without evidence that the money was used inappropriately. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said to reporters on Tuesday, for example, that USAID had spent $70,000 for the production of a \u201cDEI musical\u201d in Ireland; $47,000 for a \u201ctransgender opera\u201d in Colombia, $32,000 for a \u201ctransgender comic book\u201d in Peru. USAID did not fund those programs. They were awarded by the Department of State's Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.",

      "description": "Forced leaves have begun in Washington and worldwide for most employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Under a Trump administration plan, the agency is to be left with fewer than 300 workers out of many thousands. The leaves at USAID started Friday. Federal workers associations have turned to the courts to try to roll back orders dismantling most of the agency and U.S.- funded aid programs around the world. It's not clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what Trump administration says is a review of the aid and development programs it wants to resume.",

U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer issued the order early Saturday after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued President Donald Trump. The case alleges the Trump administration allowed Musk\u2019s team access to the Treasury Department\u2019s central payment system in violation of federal law. Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency was created to discover and eliminate what the Trump administration has deemed to be wasteful government spending.",

Their constituents are following the cost-cutting effort closely. Unlike their top elected officials, several of the constituents are expressing concerns. Some question the delivery of government services or whether Musk has the necessary authority. Others back Musk, saying his action is needed given the risk of doing nothing to sharply curb federal spending.",

He's also indicating he'll dictate programming at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions and says he'll end events featuring performers in drag. Trump made the announcement on his social media website Friday.

Drag artists are are accusing Trump of trying to censor them in country where freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution.",

      "description": "Hamas-led militants have released three gaunt, frail-looking Israeli hostages and Israel freed 183 Palestinian prisoners in the fifth exchange of a ceasefire agreement that has paused the war in Gaza. The hostages\u2019 condition and scenes of Hamas forcing them to speak in the handover sparked outrage in Israel. It could increase pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend the ceasefire beyond its current six-week phase. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza does not appear to have affected the truce's current phase. But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult one.",

They say making trains harder to climb and train surfers more easy to detect might need to be part of the solution. One subway driver says locking the doors at the ends of train cars might help prevent people from climbing onto the roof. Six people died surfing New York City subway trains last year, which was one more than in 2023. The NYPD reported that arrests of alleged subway surfers rose to 229 last year, up from 135 the year before. The youngest was 9 years old.",
