      "description": "The German government says that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Berlin on Wednesday to join Chancellor Friedrich Merz for talks with European and U.S. leaders ahead of the Trump-Putin summit later this week. Merz has convened a series of virtual meetings on Wednesday in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukraine\u2019s leaders heard ahead of a summit that they have been sidelined from. Zelenskyy is due to meet with European leaders first, to prepare for a virtual call with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance about an hour later.",

      "description": "For most of his quarter-century rule, President Vladimir Putin visited places like Paris, London, Vienna and New York. Since Moscow invaded Ukraine, however, his destinations have been Beijing, Pyongyang, Hanoi and Minsk as the West sought to turn Russia into a pariah. The trip to Alaska will be Putin\u2019s first to the U.S. since 2015, when he attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Russia has countered Western attempts to isolate it by bolstering its ties with ex-Soviet allies and other developing countries. Putin\u2019s travel also has been limited by an International Criminal Court arrest warrant from 2023 that prompted him to avoid visits to places that recognize the court\u2019s authority.",

Juneau City Manager Katie Koester told a news conference that without the barriers, hundreds of homes would have flooded. Many residents in the flood zone evacuated ahead of peak water levels.",
