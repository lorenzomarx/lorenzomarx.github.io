      "description": "Hospital officials and witnesses say Israeli forces have killed at least 23 Palestinians seeking food in the Gaza Strip. The incident happened on Sunday as hungry crowds surged around aid sites. Desperation has gripped the territory, home to over 2 million people, amid warnings of famine due to Israel\u2019s blockade and ongoing offensive. Witnesses described Israeli troops opening fire on crowds near distribution points. The Gaza health ministry also said six more Palestinian adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours. Ninety-three children have also died of causes related to malnutrition since the war in Gaza started last year, it said.",

      "description": "Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption agencies say they uncovered a major bribery scheme involving inflated military procurement contracts, just two days after lawmakers restored the agencies\u2019 independence following a public outcry. In a statement late on Saturday, they said a lawmaker, local officials, and National Guard members took kickbacks worth up to 30% on overpriced contracts for drones and electronic warfare gear. Four people have been arrested. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme \u201cabsolutely immoral\u201d and praised investigators. The exposure follows parliament\u2019s reversal of a controversial move by Zelenskyy to curb the agencies\u2019 powers.",

      "description": "The Justice Department is ramping up an effort to get election data from the states. According to an Associated Press tally, the department's voting section has requested copies of voter registration lists from state election administrators in at least 15 states. And department lawyers have contacted officials in at least seven states to propose a meeting about forging an information-sharing agreement related to instances of voting or election fraud. The unusually expansive outreach has raised alarm among some election officials. That's because states have the constitutional authority to run elections and because federal law protects the sharing of individual data with the government.",

Montana Division of Criminal Investigation administrator Lee Johnson says 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown fled The Owl Bar after the Friday shooting in the small town of Anaconda.

In the north, government-affiliated fighters confronted Kurdish-led forces who control much of the region, while in the southern province of Sweida, they clashed with Druze armed groups. Syria\u2019s interim authorities are trying to maintain a tense ceasefire in Sweida province after clashes with Druze factions last month, and to implement an agreement with the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that would reintegrate large swaths of northeastern Syria.",

      "description": "A video showing the violent arrest of a Black college student in Florida has sparked calls for drivers to use cameras that show a view from inside their car. William McNeil Jr.'s dashboard-mounted cellphone captured footage of officers beating him during a February traffic stop. The footage, which went viral when posted online last month, shows officers smashing McNeil's window and hitting him, actions not clearly visible on police bodycams. Experts suggest that car cameras can offer a unique perspective and protect against false claims. The arrest has led to discussions about police accountability and the limitations of bodycams.",
