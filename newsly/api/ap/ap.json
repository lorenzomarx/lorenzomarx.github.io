Sunday's ceremony in St. Peter's Square blends ancient ritual, evocative symbols and a nod to modern-day celebrity. Leo will start the day by taking his first tour through the piazza in the popemobile. The open-topped vehicle has become synonymous with the papacy\u2019s global reach and mediatic draw. Leo will receive the two potent symbols of the papacy during the Mass. They are the lambswool stole known as a pallium. And the fisherman\u2019s ring.",

There are also growing fears that the U.S. commitment to European defense may be weakening under former President Donald Trump. The two front-runners in a field of 13 candidates are Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, a liberal allied with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian supported by the national conservative Law and Justice party. Recent opinion polls show Trzaskowski with around 30% support and Nawrocki in the mid-20s. A second round between the top will take take place June 1 if no candidate reaches at least 50% of the vote Sunday.",

Hopes that Sunday's ballot might end the worst spell of political instability in decades for the European Union country of 10.6 million people could be dashed, however. The election is poised to deliver yet another minority government, polls suggest, leaving the Portuguese back where they started. For the past 50 years the center-right Social Democrats and the center-left Socialist Party have alternated in power. They are likely to come out on top in this ballot, too.",
