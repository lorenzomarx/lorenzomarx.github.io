      "description": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is rebuffing pressure to act on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The speaker is sending members of the House home early for a month-long break from Washington amid calls for a vote on the Epstein matter. Johnson said Tuesday morning that he wants to give the White House \u201cspace\u201d to release the Epstein information on its own. The speaker\u2019s stance seemed unlikely to satisfy many Republicans who are threatening to support a bipartisan bill to pry information from the Justice Department. Even before Johnson spoke, a Republican-controlled committee was advancing a resolution to subpoena Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, for a deposition.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is rehashing longstanding grievances over the Russia investigation that shadowed much of his first term. The Republican president lashed out Tuesday following a report from his intelligence director aimed at casting doubt on long-established findings about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Trump was not making his claims for the first time but delivered them when administration officials are harnessing the machinery of the federal government to investigate the targets of Trump\u2019s derision. That includes key officials responsible for scrutinizing Russia\u2019s attempts to intervene on Trump\u2019s behalf in the 2016 contest against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Democrats call the intelligence director's report factually flawed and politically motivated.",

The visit Tuesday highlights efforts to strengthen security and economic ties between the two countries as tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific. Their talks are expected to focus on mutual defense as China has become increasingly assertive in the South China Sea, where Manila and Beijing have clashed over hotly contested territory. The leaders also are negotiating a potential tariffs deal. Marcos met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday. Both sides emphasized their commitment to regional peace and economic collaboration.",

      "description": "The gloomy, demon-invoking lead singer of the pioneering band Black Sabbath who became the throaty, growling voice of heavy metal, Ozzy Osbourne has died. A family statement said he died Tuesday, just weeks after his farewell show. He was 76. The statement did not include a cause but in 2020, Osbourne revealed he had Parkinson's disease. Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents\u2019 groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",

The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency promoting anti-Israel speech. The UNESCO chief said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She denied accusations of anti-Israel bias,",

For decades, Coke and other beverage makers have used high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners in their U.S. sodas. But consumers are increasingly looking for products with fewer and more natural ingredients. Nutritionists say high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar are both sugars with around the same amount of calories. They are equally likely to lead to issues like obesity and tooth decay.",
