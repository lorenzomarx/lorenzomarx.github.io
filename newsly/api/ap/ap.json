      "description": "President Donald Trump says he and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to begin \u201cnegotiations\u201d on ending the Ukraine war. The Republican said in a social media post Wednesday disclosing a call between the two leaders that they would \u201cwork together, very closely.\u201d The call followed a prisoner swap that resulted in Russia releasing American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, of Pennsylvania, after more than three years of detention. Two U.S. officials say convicted Russian criminal Alexander Vinnik is being freed as part of the swap that saw Moscow\u2019s release of Fogel. The officials spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss the swap.",

      "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says NATO membership for Ukraine is unrealistic. In sweeping remarks Wednesday, Hegseth suggested that the way forward for Ukraine is for the country to abandon hopes of a return to its pre-2014 borders and prepare for a negotiated settlement with Russia \u2014 one that should be backed up with an international force of troops. Hegseth made the comments during the first trip to NATO and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group by a member of the new Trump administration. Allies have been waiting to hear how much continued military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine\u2019s government.",

The exchange involves an American teacher who spent more than three years in detention in Russia. Marc Fogel is a teacher from just outside Pittsburgh. He was traveling to Russia to work at a school in 2021 when he was detained. His family and supporters said he had been traveling with medically prescribed marijuana. Almost a year later, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

The vote Wednesday came after Republicans who had initially questioned her experience and judgment fell in line behind her nomination. Gabbard was an unconventional pick to oversee and coordinate the country\u2019s 18 different intelligence agencies. She had made past comments sympathetic to Russia, she once met with now-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad and had expressed previous support for government leaker Edward Snowden. Gabbard is a military veteran and a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii. She has no formal intelligence experience and has never run a government agency or department.",

The average price of a dozen Grade A eggs in U.S. cities reached $4.95 in January, eclipsing the previous record of $4.82 set in January 2023. Of course, that is only the nationwide average. A carton of eggs can cost $10 or more in some places. And specialized varieties, such as organic and cage-free eggs, are even more expensive.",

But the funds are being misrepresented. The city said it did receive $80 million last week, two tranches of funding from the Shelter and Service Program, which is administered by FEMA on behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The money was authorized by Congress in 2023 for SSP, which was created to support local government and NGOs to provide noncitizens released by immigration authorities. The money is separate from disaster relief funds.",

      "description": "U.S. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of groceries and gasoline rose, a trend that will likely underscore the Federal Reserve\u2019s resolve to delay any further interest rate cuts. The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, Wednesday\u2019s report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. It has increased from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September. The figures underscore the stickiness of inflation, which created a major political problem for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged to reduce prices in last year\u2019s campaign, though most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs.",
