      "description": "President Donald Trump has floated cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% ahead of a weekend meeting as he looks to deescalate the trade war. Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since Trump sparked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their counterparts in Geneva in the most-senior known conversations between the two countries in months. It comes amid growing U.S. market worry over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods.",

He will meet on Friday with the cardinals who chose him to lead the Catholic Church and follow in Pope Francis\u2019 reform-minded footsteps. Leo, the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost, surprised the world on Thursday when he emerged on the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, since there had long been a taboo against a pope from the United States. He spoke to the crowd in Italian and Spanish, but not English, and honored Pope Francis for his final salute to the crowd on Easter Sunday.",

He said Thursday that he was in \u201cdisbelief\u201d and then felt an incredible sense of pride that his brother, Cardinal Robert Prevost, had become the 267th pontiff to lead the Catholic Church, taking the name Leo XIV. That makes the Chicago-born missionary the first U.S. pope. John Prevost described his brother as being very concerned for the poor and those who don\u2019t have a voice. He said he expects him to be a \u201csecond Pope Francis.\u201d",

The Federal Aviation Administration said the radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday. That\u2019s similar to what happened on April 28. That first radar outage led to hundreds of flights being cancelled or delayed at the Newark airport in the past two weeks after the FAA slowed down traffic at the airport to ensure safety.",

The ascetic bachelor and New Hampshire Republican became a darling of liberals during his nearly 20 years on the bench. The court says Souter died Thursday at his home in New Hampshire. He retired from the court in June 2009, giving President Barack Obama his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill. Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, the court\u2019s first Latina justice. Souter was appointed by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990. He was a reliably liberal vote on abortion, church-state relations, freedom of expression and the accessibility of federal courts.",

      "description": "Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade. Trump asserted that children will be fine having two or three dolls instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch. The president\u2019s comments also touched a nerve with parents who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need. Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the administration's trade standoff with China, which produces most of America's playthings. Some smaller importers say they won't have enough holiday inventory without a reprieve in the next two weeks.",

Defense lawyer Mike Cibella began questioning Kaja Sokola on Friday at Weinstein's retrial. Among other things, Cibella pointed to differences in the details of her testimony this week and what she told a grand jury last year. Weinstein is facing charges including a criminal sex act count that's based on Sokola's allegation that he forced oral sex on her in 2006, when she was 19. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",

      "description": "A new study shows that chimpanzees drum with regular rhythm when they beat on tree trunks. Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps clearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms. This suggests that the ability to produce rhythm predates the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, dating back more than 6 million years. Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication. The research was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.",

Cases are climbing not only in Mexico, but in the U.S. and Canada. Mexico's cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community in the northern border state of Chihuahua. It's a community long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities. Officials say results of the campaign alongside Mennonite leaders are mixed. They cite tens of thousands of vaccinations in Chihuahua. But infections have ballooned, spreading past the community to Indigenous and other populations. Vaccination teams say door-to-door efforts are helping, even if not everyone is open to the shot. Some ask questions and follow up later. Others won't even open the door.",
