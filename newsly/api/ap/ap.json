      "description": "The House is expected to approve President Donald Trump\u2019s request to claw back about $9 billion for public broadcasting and foreign aid. A final vote to approve the spending cuts package is scheduled for Thursday evening. Republicans are targeting institutions and programs they view as bloated or out of step with their agenda. The White House has described the package as a test case and says if Congress goes along, more requests will come. The House\u2019s approval would mark the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a request to Congress.",

      "description": "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency. It\u2019s a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. It happens when veins in the legs can\u2019t properly carry blood back to the heart, which can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight.",

Druze leaders and Syrian government officials announced a renewed ceasefire late Wednesday that was mediated by the U.S., Turkey and Arab countries. Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said in an address early Thursday that some Druze factions and clerics were appointed to maintain internal security in Sweida. Israeli strikes targeting government troops did not immediately stop. The dayslong fighting has threatened to unravel Syria\u2019s postwar political transition and brought in further military intervention by Israel.",

Her death was announced Thursday by her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, who didn't immediately provide additional details. Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \u201cWho\u2019s Sorry Now?\u201d and including the No. 1 songs \u201cDon\u2019t Break the Heart That Loves You\u201d and \u201cThe Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\u201d",

The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that Juul's benefits as a less harmful alternative for adult smokers outweigh the risks of teen use. It's a major win for a company that has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend. Parents, politicians and antitobacco advocates wanted a ban on the devices that many blame for the recent spike in underage vaping. The FDA decision applies to both tobacco and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product.",

Josh Stein announced the declaration Thursday, citing overwhelmed local response efforts. The storm, followed by more severe weather, dumped up to 12 inches of rain in some areas, causing rivers to reach record levels. Damage to water systems left some residents without safe drinking water. The emergency declaration, effective Wednesday, allows the state to seek federal aid for recovery. Emergency crews rescued dozens of people, but several were found dead, including people killed by floodwaters.",
