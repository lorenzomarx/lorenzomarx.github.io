      "description": "President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington. And that's leading the city\u2019s mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation\u2019s capital. Trump says in a social media post that he plans a White House news conference at 10 a.m. Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia, in his words, \u201csafer and more beautiful than it ever was before.\u201d On Thursday, the Republican president directed an increased federal law enforcement presence in the Democratic-run city for seven days, \u201cwith the option to extend as needed.\u201d Federal agencies including the FBI assigned more than 120 officers and agents to assist in Washington.",

      "description": "A federal judge in New York has ruled transcripts of secret grand jury testimony in the sex trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell won\u2019t be released. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued his written ruling on Monday. The judge says releasing the transcripts would risk unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term after her conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping procure girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell recently was interviewed by the Department of Justice and was moved from a prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas. Maxwell's attorney says she testified truthfully.",

Unofficially, more than 14 inches fell in less than 24 hours in one spot, causing rivers to flood, washing out vehicles, and cutting power to thousands. As of Monday morning, no fatalities have been reported. Road closures are more isolated, and flood warnings continued in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. About 3,000 homes remain without power. Forecasters predict more rain Monday night, but not like the weekend deluge. The National Weather Service says four rivers in the Milwaukee area hit record-high levels over the weekend.",

      "description": "A blistering heatwave gripped southwest France on Monday, sending thermometers soaring to 43 degrees Celsius in parts of the Charente and Aude. In Aude, a patchwork of vineyards and Mediterranean scrubland, hundreds of firefighters remained on the hillsides guarding the edges of a massive blaze that scorched 16,000 hectares last week. Officials say the flames are under control, but warn the fire will not be fully extinguished for weeks. The national weather authority, Meteo-France, placed 12 departments on red alert, France\u2019s highest heat warning, anticipating exceptional heat stretching from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean plains. Another 41 departments were under lower-level orange alerts, as was the neighboring microstate of Andorra.",

Miguel Uribe, 39, was shot three times while giving a campaign speech in Bogota and had been in intensive care since the attack. A teenage suspect was arrested at the scene, but it's unclear who ordered the hit. The shooting alarmed Colombians, recalling the political violence of the 1990s. Uribe was a prominent figure in the conservative Democratic Center party. The attack sparked calls for justice and an end to violence.",
