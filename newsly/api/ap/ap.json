      "description": "A federal judge says the White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries with a flight linked to the chaotic nation of South Sudan. The Trump administration says it expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes in the United States but refused to reveal where they would end up. Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. He ordered a new set of interviews with the migrants, either back in the U.S. or abroad. Before Wednesday's hearing, administration officials accused \u201cactivist judges\u201d of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.",

      "description": "The Justice Department has moved to cancel settlements with Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky, that called for an overhaul of policing following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The department announced the steps Wednesday. Minneapolis in January approved a consent decree with the federal government in the final days of the Biden administration to overhaul its training and use-of-force policies under court supervision. The agreement required approval from a federal court. But the Trump administration told the court it doesn't intend to proceed. The administration also announced it's retracting the findings of Justice Department investigations into six other police departments that the Biden administration had accused of civil rights violations.",

Trump said during Wednesday's meeting that people are fleeing South Africa for their own safety.

Ramaphosa pushed back against Trump\u2019s accusation, saying of the behavior alleged by the U.S. president, \u201cWe are completely opposed to that.\u201d",
