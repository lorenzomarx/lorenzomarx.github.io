      "description": "Hospitals in Gaza have reported the killing of more than a dozen people, half of them food-seekers, by Israeli fire on Saturday as Palestinians endured severe risks in their search for food amid airdrops and restrictions on overland aid delivery. Eyewitnesses described chaos and gunfire at aid distribution sites, which the Israel-backed private American contractor denied. Airstrikes also killed families in tents and homes, health and hospital officials said. Meanwhile, hostage families protested in Tel Aviv, urging a deal to end the war. As border crossings remain blocked, more countries joined airdrop efforts, which UN officials say are costly and insufficient to address the crisis.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's economic policies are facing scrutiny as weak indicators emerge. Job gains are dwindling, inflation is rising and growth has slowed compared to last year. More than six months into his term, Trump's tariffs and tax changes have reshaped the economy. On Friday, a bleak jobs report showed a decline in manufacturing jobs, and Trump fired the head of the agency responsible for the data. Critics warn that Trump's aggressive use of tariffs and tax changes could backfire. The White House, however, remains optimistic, claiming the best is yet to come.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff onslaught this week left a lot of losers \u2013 from small, poor countries like Laos and Algeria to wealthy U.S. trading partners like Canada and Switzerland. They\u2019re now facing hefty taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 on the products they export to the United States. What\u2019s unclear is whether there will ultimately be any winners \u2013 even in the United States, the intended beneficiary of Trump\u2019s protectionist policies. Trump\u2019s trade war has pushed the average U.S. tariff from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3% now, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. One expert at the New York Law School said that \u201cin many respects, everybody\u2019s a loser here.\u2019\u2019",

      "description": "Some Republican-controlled states are moving to redraw legislative maps to pad their party's narrow House majority in Washington. They're acting at President Donald Trump's urging, and that's forced Democrats to rethink their embrace of a nonpartisan approach to line-drawing. In many Democratic-controlled states, independent commissions rather than the state legislature handle redistricting. That means Democrats have few options to match Republicans, who are redrawing the congressional map in Texas to carve out as many as five new winnable seats for the GOP. That could be enough to prevent Democrats from winning back the majority in the midterm elections near year.",

Students in the most sparsely populated regions often face obstacles to attending college, including having to travel far to get to campus, a lack of public transportation, and inconsistent broadband access that limits access to online courses and financial aid. Family dynamics also often factor in, including a lack of exposure to college because parents didn\u2019t attend and an underlying doubt about the value of a college degree and curriculum. Some colleges have stepped up efforts to recruit rural students.",

The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they\u2019re 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt.
