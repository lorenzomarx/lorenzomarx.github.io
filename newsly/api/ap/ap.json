      "description": "Health officials in Gaza say Israeli strikes have killed at least 34 Palestinians. The bloodshed comes a day after Israel eased aid restrictions due to a worsening humanitarian crisis. On Sunday, Israel announced a pause in military operations in certain areas for 10 hours daily to improve aid flow. Despite these measures, Israel continues military operations outside the pause timeframe. Aid agencies welcomed the new measures but say they are insufficient. Images of emaciated children have sparked global outrage. Most of Gaza's population now relies on aid and accessing food has become increasingly dangerous.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has expressed concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, urging Israel to ensure food reaches the people there. Speaking in Scotland on Monday, Trump emphasized the need for action as images of starving children have sparked international outcry. Trump noted that the U.S. and other nations are providing aid, but stressed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must manage its distribution.

His announcement Monday came as the Ukrainian air force said Russia fired another overnight barrage at Ukraine. Trump said two weeks ago he would implement \u201csevere tariffs\u201d on Russia unless a peace deal is reached by early September. Trump said he would give Putin 10 to 12 days from Monday instead. That means he wants peace efforts to make progress by Aug. 7-9. The plan includes possible sanctions and secondary tariffs targeting Russia\u2019s trading partners.",

      "description": "The European Union's trade agreement with the Trump administration is receiving mixed reviews. EU officials claim they avoided a major economic disaster, but French officials argue the EU didn't leverage its full strength. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most goods imported into the U.S., with no agreement on key areas like pharmaceuticals and steel. French officials criticize the deal as unbalanced, while Germany and Italy see it as avoiding unnecessary escalation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n calls it a failure for Europe. Economists warn the deal could hinder growth and lacks clarity.",

The fighting, which began last Thursday after a land mine explosion injured Thai soldiers, has killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000 people. Both countries have recalled their ambassadors, and Thailand has closed border crossings with Cambodia. The meeting Monday follows direct pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has warned the United States may not proceed with trade deals with either country if hostilities continue. Before departing for Kuala Lumpur, Thailand's acting prime minister said the key focus would be on an immediate ceasefire, but noted trust could be an issue.",
