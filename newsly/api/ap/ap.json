      "description": "UK police have arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Prince Andrew, on suspicion of misconduct in public office. On Thursday, Thames Valley Police said they opened an investigation after assessing reports about his alleged contact with Jeffrey Epstein. Police did not name him, which follows U.K. practice, but they confirmed they arrested a man in his 60s. Police say they want to protect the integrity of the investigation. They also said the case drawed strong public interest and they planned to share updates at the right time. Pictures online also appeared to show police cars and officers outside his home.",

      "description": "Crews have pushed through mountainous wilderness in California near Lake Tahoe during a snowstorm to rescue six backcountry skiers who survived an avalanche but were trapped by its snow and ice. Nine others from their tour group remain missing. The Nevada County Sheriff's Office says two of the six were taken to a hospital for treatment. The sheriff\u2019s office says there were 15 skiers on the trip \u2014 not 16 as initially believed. Extreme weather conditions in the Northern California mountains slowed the rescue effort. It took crews several hours to reach the skiers and take them to safety, where they were evaluated by the Truckee Fire Department.",

      "description": "Experts say a weekslong \u201csnow drought\u201d in Norther California's Sierra Nevada helped set the stage for Tuesday's deadly avalanche, after several feet of new snow fell on an earlier layer that had hardened. The new snow didn't bond to the earlier layer before the avalanche near Lake Tahoe killed at least eight backcountry skiers, said San Jose State University meteorology professor Craig Clements. Six skiers survived and rescuers were searching for another who was still missing. The group was on a three-day backcountry trek when they were trapped by the avalanche as a winter storm pummeled the West Coast.",

      "description": "Governors are arriving in Washington for an annual gathering that has traditionally been a show of bipartisanship. But President Donald Trump has disrupted norms by not inviting all governors to meetings at the White House. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, joined Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, both Republicans, in opening this year\u2019s National Governors Association on a panel where they emphasized bipartisanship regardless of Trump's actions. The break with tradition reflects Trump\u2019s broader approach in his second term. He has taken a confrontational stance toward some state leaders, withholding federal funds from states that draw his ire and deploying federal troops to cities over the objections of local officials.",

Because of the turmoil, 12-time convicted felon Cory Allen McKay caught a break. He was scheduled to stand trial next month on methamphetamine trafficking charges that could have locked him up for 25 years. Instead, he walked free after the prosecutor on his case retired. The diminished U.S. Attorney's Office has been forced to dismiss some cases, kill others before charges are filed and seek plea agreements and delays. Local officials worry the office will be unable to bring charges against some of the state\u2019s most serious offenders.",

The Seoul Central District Court on Thursday found Yoon guilty of mobilizing military and police forces in an illegal attempt to seize the liberal-led National Assembly, arrest politicians and establish unchecked power for a considerable time. Yoon is likely to appeal the verdict. Yoon fell from office after an ill-advised attempt to overcome an opposition-controlled legislature by declaring martial law and sending troops to surround the legislature on Dec. 3, 2024. A special prosecutor had requested the death penalty, saying Yoon deserved harsh punishment for the threat his actions posed to the country\u2019s democracy.",

A law enforcement database didn't turn up any matches to DNA found in gloves a few miles from Guthrie's home.",
