      "description": "Texas and Oklahoma are bracing for ice and heavy snow in what forecasters predict will be some of the initial major effects of a huge winter storm. The forecasted days-long event threatens catastrophic damage, extensive power outages and bitterly cold weather in the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. Forecasters warn the storm could rival a hurricane in damage to power lines and trees, especially in areas with heavy ice. The storm is expected to start Friday in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, moving east through the South and then up the coast into New England. Bitterly cold air could follow, with wind chills dropping to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota.",

      "description": "A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy has been asking Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest against immigration enforcement in the state. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer during an operation on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the area for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements online and in the streets. But Friday\u2019s mobilization was planned as the largest action to date, including a march in downtown Minneapolis despite dangerously cold temperatures.",

      "description": "It has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the U.S. to not open the door for federal immigration agents unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people\u2019s homes without a judge\u2019s warrant. That marks a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades. Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more agents barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.",

      "description": "Activists report that Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people. Many more are feared dead, but information is scarce in part because Iran has imposed the most comprehensive internet blackout in its history. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency provided the latest death toll Friday and noted more than 26,800 people have been detained. Iran's government says 3,117 have died, but it has a history of giving lower tolls for political reasons. The Associated Press has been unable to verify these numbers due to the two-week internet shutdown. Meanwhile, the U.S. has moved an aircraft carrier group closer to the Middle East, and President Donald Trump is warning of potential action against Iran.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve. The court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only \u201cfor cause.\u201d That is now being put to the test in a case involving Trump\u2019s attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the Supreme Court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job. But it largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?",
