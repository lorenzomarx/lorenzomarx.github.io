The 95-year-old Curry was among at least 25 victims of the devastating California wildfires, dying at her home in Altadena. Born in 1929 in Little Rock, Arkansas, that big personality had be to be destined for Hollywood. She settled in Los Angeles, where she never became a star but was fortunate enough to rub shoulders with some of the elites of Hollywood,, including backing up singer Pearl Bailey and being an extra in several movies. She was also mentored by the first Black woman to ever sign a movie contract.",

      "description": "Heartbroken families, burned-out business owners and beleaguered Los Angeles leaders are beginning to ponder a monumental task: rebuilding what was lost in the Southern California wildfires. Even with the flames of two large fires still leaping, government officials are talking of the vast job of clearing toxic debris. Then it will be rebuilding homes, restaurants, schools, boutiques and houses of worship in devastated communities. All the while, finding financing for it all. LA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger says homeowners are saying that rebuilding is a question of when, not if. Much remains unknown: What should the neighborhoods look like? And will fire-resistant materials and designs be used?",

But meteorologist Todd Hall says they're possible given the extreme conditions. Fire whirl, fire devil, fire tornado or even firenado \u2014 scientists, firefighters and regular folks use multiple terms to describe similar phenomena, and they don\u2019t always agree on what\u2019s what. Some say fire whirls are formed only by heat, while fire tornadoes involve clouds generated by the fire itself. In 2018, a fire tornado the size of three football fields killed a firefighter near Redding, California. Across the country, scientists are studying the fire whirls in a lab in Massachusetts.",

Families of the hostages do not know whether their loved ones are alive or dead, and many will have to wait for a subsequent phase of the agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In war-ravaged Gaza, many displaced Palestinians do not know if their homes are still standing. Thousands are still buried under rubble and dozens are missing after encounters with Israeli forces. Vast areas appear uninhabitable, and it could take decades to rebuild. In the tense leadup to the announcement of the deal, relatives of the hostages were afraid to get their hopes up and agonizing over the unknown.",

Netanyahu\u2019s office said his Cabinet won\u2019t meet to approve the agreement until Hamas backs down, accusing it of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced the deal on Wednesday, which is aimed at releasing scores of hostages held in Gaza and winding down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.",

With America\u2019s population shifting from reliably Democratic states to areas controlled by Republicans, Democrats are facing a demographic time bomb that could reduce their path to winning the U.S. House or the presidency for the long term. If current trends hold through the 2030 census, states that voted for Kamala Harris will lose around a dozen House seats \u2014 and Electoral College votes \u2014 to states that voted for President-elect Donald Trump.
