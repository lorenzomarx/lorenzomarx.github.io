The attack early Friday came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump rebuked Russia\u2019s leader for a deadly missile and drone attack on Kyiv while Washington endeavors to stop the more than three-year war. Russia pounded Kyiv in an hourslong barrage Thursday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 87 in its deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since July. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday for the second time this month.",

U.S. President Donald Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei are among the leaders arriving Friday. That is the last day Argentine pope will lie in state in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica before his coffin is sealed in preparation for his funeral Saturday. More than 90,000 mourners have waited hours in line to bid farewell to Francis, who died Monday.",

It came during a particularly low point in his papacy, when he was struggling with cases of priests who sexually abused children. Francis bestowed the name after Winfield challenged him with especially tough questions about his seeming indifference toward Chilean abuse victims. In an AP interview in 2023, Francis acknowledged that the 2018 news conference where the exchange took place was the moment he began to understand the depths of the scandal.",

India immediately described the massacre a \u201cterror attack\u201d and said it had \u201ccross border\u201d links, blaming Pakistan for backing it.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows just under half of U.S. adults approve of Trump\u2019s handling of immigration, which is nearly 10 percentage points higher than his approval rating on the economy and foreign trade. But about half of Americans say the Republican president has \u201cgone too far\u201d when it comes to deporting immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

But unlike in his first term, Trump\u2019s efforts have not sparked the kind of widespread condemnation that forced him to retreat from some unpopular positions. Immigration has emerged as one of the Republican president's strongest issues in public polling. The White House has seized on this shift, mocking critics and egging on Democrats to engage on an issue Trump\u2019s team sees as a win.",

While Ward, Hunter and Abdul Carter went 1-2-3 as expected, Sanders wasn't picked at all in the first round. Sanders was passed over by every team that had a need for a potential franchise quarterback, even though some draft analysts had him rated higher than Ward. The New York Giants had two chances to take Sanders and went with Penn State edge rusher Carter with the No. 3 pick, bolstering an already strong pass rush. The Giants then moved back into the first round and selected Dart, a quarterback from Ole Miss, at No. 25.",
