      "description": "An Israeli official says Cabinet ministers have approved plans to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. The official said the plan was gradual and involved claiming more territory in the Palestinian enclave. The approval comes a day after Israel announced it was calling up tens of thousands of reservist for the expanded operations in Gaza, which Israel says are meant to increase pressure on the militant Hamas group to negotiate a ceasefire that better aligns with Israel\u2019s terms. An eight-week ceasefire with the Hamas militant group collapsed in March when Israel resumed strikes in Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians, many of them women and children.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s military says it has carried out airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen\u2019s Red Sea city of Hodeida, a day after the Iranian-backed rebels launched a missile that hit Israel\u2019s main airport. The rebels\u2019 media office said the United States and Israel launched at least six strikes Monday afternoon that hit the crucial Hodeida port. The rebels said other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province. On Sunday, a missile launched by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen briefly halted flights and commuter traffic at Israel\u2019s main international airport. Four people were lightly injured. It was the first time a missile struck the grounds of Israel\u2019s airport since the start of the war.",

The ceremony, mandated by Vatican law and revised by Pope Benedict XVI, includes clerics and lay staff alike: cooks, cleaners, doctors, nurses and security officials. Nearly 135 cardinal electors will gather in the Sistine Chapel, beginning on Wednesday, to vote in secret for Pope Francis\u2019s successor. The oath, which explicitly forbids recording or disclosing anything from within the conclave, underscores the Church\u2019s insistence on confidentiality. Cardinals are bound by their own rules of secrecy. They will take their oaths on Wednesday as well.",

Prizes were awarded on Monday for reporting, photography and commentary that touched on issues including the war in Gaza, the fentanyl crisis and last summer\u2019s assassination attempt on President Donald Trump. ProPublica won the prestigious public service medal for the second straight year, this time for reporting on pregnant women who died because of doctors who did not provide care because of concerns about new abortion laws. The Pulitzers also honored editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes, who quit the Washington Post because it wouldn\u2019t run her cartoon criticizing tech leaders that included her newspaper\u2019s owner",

The commander of the 12th Aviation Battalion directed the unit to pause flight operations around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport following Thursday\u2019s close calls, two Army officials confirmed to The Associated Press. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not publicly announced. The unit is continuing to fly in the greater Washington, D.C., region.

      "description": "The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite harsh criticism from President Donald Trump and his demand that the Fed reduce borrowing costs. After causing a sharp drop in financial markets two weeks ago by saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the Republican leader backed off and said he had no intention of doing so. Still, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said the Fed should cut rates. The heightened scrutiny shows that even as the Trump administration backs off its threats to fire Powell, the Fed is still subject to unusually sharp political pressures, despite being an independent agency.",

The Department of Homeland Security said Monday that it's also paying for travel assistance and that people who use their CBP Home app to tell the government they plan to return home will be \u201cdeprioritized\u201d for detention and removal by immigration enforcement. Trump has made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign. But that is a costly, resource-intensive endeavor.

The evening's starry guest list amounts to about 450 high-profile people from tech, sports, art, entertainment and more. This is the first Met Gala to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years to have a menswear theme. Among the hosts are Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo and A$AP Rocky. LeBron James was made honorary chair but bowed out of attending due to a knee injury.
