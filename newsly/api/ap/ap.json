      "description": "The Northeastern U.S. is getting the last brunt of a massive winter storm that dumped snow, sleet and ice across much of the southern and eastern U.S. over the weekend. The colossal storm halted air and road traffic in many areas and sent temperatures plunging. As the work week began, the heaviest snow was falling from New York northward into New England. That's after heavy ice snapped branches and power lines in the South, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without electricity. In the meantime, arctic air was spreading in behind the storm and some communities in New York saw record-breaking subzero temperatures.",

      "description": "The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a federal immigration officer touched off a firestorm and prompted some fellow Republicans to question President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night doubled down and blamed Democratic officials. After remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations. He also called on officials in Minnesota to work with immigration officers and \u201cturn over\u201d people who were in the U.S. illegally.",

      "description": "A federal judge is set to hear arguments Monday on whether to pause an immigration crackdown in Minnesota. This follows the fatal shootings of two people by government officers. The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security two weeks ago. They want to restore conditions before the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge began in December. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison plans to attend the hearing. Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit legally frivolous. The case could have implications for other states facing similar immigration enforcement operations like that underway in Minnesota.",

Officials say the M/V Trisha Kerstin 3, a cargo and passenger ferry, was sailing from the port city of Zamboanga to southern Jolo island in Sulu province with 332 passengers and 27 crew members early Monday when it apparently encountered technical problems and sank. Coast guard officials said the cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but noted that the boat was cleared by the coast guard before departing and did not appear to be overcrowded.",

The Bombardier Challenger 600 crashed around 7:45 p.m. Sunday. There was no immediate word on the conditions of those aboard and an airport statement said the airport was closed and emergency crews were at the site. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The crash occurred as New England and much of the country grappled with a massive winter storm. Bangor had steady snowfall Sunday like much of the northeastern United States.",

Zhang Youxia was the highest military member just below President Xi Jinping. The Defense Ministry said Saturday that authorities were investigating Zhang, the senior of the two vice chairs of the powerful Central Military Commission. Authorities also are investigating Gen. Liu Zhenli, who was in charge of the military\u2019s Joint Staff Department. The full impact of the changes for the army and China in general remains unknown. Some experts say this might have repercussion on Beijing\u2019s next move on Taiwan, the self-rule island that Beijing claims as its own territory.",

Instead, the investigators will detail all the things they found that played a role in the crash near Washington, and the board will recommend changes that should be made to help prevent a similar event from happening again.

The association has worked with 3,000 people of color, with 92 in creative jobs. Despite initial momentum from the Black Lives Matter movement, attention has waned. Ngonmo now focuses on supportive institutions like the Italian National Fashion Chamber, which backs emerging Black talents like Victor-Hart.",
