      "description": "A peace proposal by the Trump administration that includes recognizing Russian authority over Crimea shocked Ukrainian officials. They say they will not accept any formal surrender of the peninsula, even though they expect to concede the territory to the Kremlin, at least temporarily. Experts say giving up the land that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 is also politically and legally impossible. It would require a change to the Ukrainian constitution and a nationwide vote, and it could be considered treason. Lawmakers and the public are firmly opposed to the idea.",

Trump said, \u201cIt makes me think that maybe he doesn\u2019t want to stop the war, he\u2019s just tapping me along.\u201d",

A provincial disaster management official told Iranian state television there were injuries in Saturday's blast, without elaborating. He added that first responders were trying to reach the area while others were attempting to evacuate the site. The official said the blast came from containers at Rajaei port in the city. Social media videos showed a huge plume of black smoke. Rajaei port mainly handles container traffic and also has oil tanks and other petrochemical facilities.",

The appointment Saturday of Hussein al-Sheikh as vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization does not guarantee he will be the next Palestinian president. But it makes him the front-runner among longtime politicians in the dominant Fatah party who hope to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas. Abbas hopes to play a major role in postwar Gaza. He has been under pressure from Western and Arab allies to rehabilitate the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",

The U.N. General Assembly has asked the International Court of Justice to weigh in on Israel\u2019s legal obligations after the country effectively banned the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees from operating. The agency had been the main provider of aid to Gaza. The court has been asked to give a non-binding but legally definitive answer.

But there's already a wrinkle going into the meetings. One of Francis\u2019 enduring legacies was that he greatly expanded the ranks of the cardinals who will elect his successor, naming \u201cprinces of the church\u201d from faraway countries that had never had one before. That legacy is now throwing a wrench in the traditional sport of speculating about the next pope, since these cardinals don\u2019t know one another well and haven\u2019t coalesced into clear voting blocs.",

Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Trump has been mostly focusing on the wrong priorities as to say he's been focusing on the right ones. The findings suggest Democrats are even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in. While about 7 in 10 Republicans say Trump has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president so far, only about half say he\u2019s emphasized the right things.",
