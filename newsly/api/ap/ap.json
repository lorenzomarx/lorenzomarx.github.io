      "description": "Several hundred people have gathered for a worship ceremony at a high school stadium in Texas. The vigil was held Wednesday evening to remember of the at least 120 people who died in the catastrophic flash floods over the July Fourth holiday. More than 160 are still believed to be missing in hard-hit Kerr County. People in the crowd clutched one another and brushed away tears during the vigil. Search crews and volunteers are continuing to scour miles along the Guadalupe River for the people still missing. The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has sent out tariff letters to seven smaller U.S. trading partners in his first batch of import tax announcements of the day. The countries targeted so far Wednesday are the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka. None of them is a major industrial rival to the United States. He says a letter is also coming for Brazil. Most economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth. But Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies.",

Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor's lawyers say O'Connor invoked doctor-client privilege and his rights under the Fifth Amendment before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. Republicans are investigating Biden\u2019s actions in office and questioning whether the Democrat's use of an autopen may have been invalid.

James Comer of Kentucky says O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision not to testify makes it \"clear there was a conspiracy.\u201d",

      "description": "The Trump administration has resumed sending some weapons to Ukraine, a week after the Pentagon had directed that some deliveries be paused. The weapons now moving into Ukraine include 155 mm munitions and precision-guided rockets known as GMLRS, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear exactly when the weapons started moving. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the pause last week to allow the Pentagon to assess its weapons stockpiles, in a move that caught the White House by surprise. The Pentagon has denied that Hegseth acted without consulting President Donald Trump. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly.",
