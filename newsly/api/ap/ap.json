      "description": "Israeli airstrikes killed 15 Palestinians in Gaza early on Friday, while a hospital said another 20 people died in shootings while waiting for aid. Meanwhile, the U.N. human rights office says it has recorded 613 killings in Gaza near humanitarian convoys and aid distribution points run by an Israeli-backed American organization since it first began operations in late May. Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the rights office was not able to attribute responsibility for the killings. But she said \u201cit is clear that the Israeli military has shelled and shot at Palestinians trying to reach the distribution points\u201d operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",

      "description": "Russia launched 550 drones and missiles across Ukraine overnight in the largest aerial assaults since the war began. The capital Kyiv was the primary target. At least 23 people were injured, and multiple residential buildings in the capital were damaged. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 270 targets and another 208 targets were lost from radar and presumed jammed, but dozens still struck or caused damage across the city. Fires and destruction were reported in at least five of Kyiv's 10 districts, and railway infrastructure was also hit. The attack came hours after President Donald Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and made his first public comments on the U.S. decision to pause some shipments of weapons to Ukraine.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump plans to sign his signature bill of tax and spending cuts at the White House Fourth of July picnic. He's taking a victory lap after muscling his main legislative priority through the Republican-controlled Congress. Fighter jets and a stealth bomber are expected to streak the sky over the event later Friday where Trump will turn the legislation into law. The legislation extends Trump's 2017 multi-trillion dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.",

District Judge Randolph Moss decided Friday to send the case to a judge in Boston whose rulings led to the initial halt of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to begin deportations to South Sudan. The immigrants and their federal guards have been waiting in Djibouti, Africa, for weeks after a judge ordered the administration not to deport anyone to \u201cthird countries\u201d where they did not originate.

Organizers see the coming year of festivities, which start Thursday, as a way to help unite a polarized country and bridge partisan divides. But a recent Gallup poll showed the widest partisan split in patriotism in over two decades, with only about a third of Democrats saying they are proud to be American compared with about 9 in 10 Republicans. As a candidate, Trump proposed a \u201cGreat American State Fair\u201d in Iowa, but it will take place next year in Washington instead.",
