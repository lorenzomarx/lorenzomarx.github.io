      "description": "Israeli airstrikes have hit Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, just days after the Iran-backed rebels fired cluster munitions toward Israel. That's according to the rebel-run media office and a local television station, which reported the strikes on Sunday. The attack was the first to hit the rebel-held Sanaa since a week ago, when Israel said targeted energy infrastructure it believed was used by the rebels. Israel has not confirmed Sunday\u2019s attack. The Houthis have launched missiles and drones toward Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea for more than 22 months. They say they are carrying out the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the war in the Gaza Strip.",

      "description": "Pricey prescriptions and nagging medical costs are swamping some insurers and employers, which means patients may start paying more next year. Health insurance will grow more expensive in many corners of the market in 2026, and some coverage may shrink. That could leave patients exposed to more costs for doctor visits and prescription coverage changes. Price changes could be especially stark in individual coverage marketplaces, where insurers also are predicting the end of some government support that helps people buy coverage. Expensive gene therapies and diabetes and obesity treatments are pressuring prescription coverage.",

The Trump administration requires this as part of an effort to deport the El Salvador national, who was released from jail in Tennessee last week.

His case has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March. He has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges.",
