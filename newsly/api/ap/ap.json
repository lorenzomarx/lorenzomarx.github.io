      "description": "The White House says guests at President Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress will include the widow of a slain New York police officer, a Pennsylvania teacher who was detained in Russia and the family of a man killed at Trump\u2019s assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Trump on Tuesday will give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. Some Americans fear for the country\u2019s future after the Republican president\u2019s aggressive early moves, while others cheer him on. Democrats are highlighting the impact of Trump\u2019s actions by inviting as guests fired federal workers and people who\u2019d be harmed by cuts to Medicaid and other programs.",

      "description": "A president\u2019s address to Congress \u2014 even without the formal gloss of a State of the Union address \u2014 is typically a time for a call to national unity and predictable claims about the country being strong. But that wasn\u2019t President Donald Trump\u2019s plan. His speech on Tuesday night was relentlessly partisan, boasting about his election victory and criticizing Democrats for failing to recognize his accomplishments. The hard edge reflected Trump\u2019s bulldozer approach to his second term, brushing aside opposition and demanding loyalty throughout the federal government.",

As workers are being fired coast to coast, Democrats are jumping in to shine a bright light on what is happening. Johnson said lawmakers could meet in small venues or on telephone town halls. He echoed President Donald Trump's claim that the demonstrations are just paid protesters. Democrats say Republicans are afraid to speak honestly about cuts to Medicaid and other federal programs.",

To do that, the federal government would have to activate a seldom-used committee nicknamed the \u201cGod Squad.\u201d It's called that because it can approve federal projects even if it leads to extinction of a species otherwise protected by the Endangered Species Act. But experts say there are strict procedural requirements \u2014 and no provision under law to proactively use the committee to bypass protections.",
