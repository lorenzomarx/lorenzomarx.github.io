      "description": "Democratic officials and protesters on the streets are demanding that federal immigration officers leave Minnesota after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis. Saturday's shooting drew hundreds of demonstrators into the frigid cold in a city already shaken by another killing weeks earlier. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara says information about what led up to the latest shooting is limited. The man has been identified by his parents as Alex Pretti. He was a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse. The Minnesota National Guard assisted local police in monitoring the crowds.",

      "description": "Some Republicans are calling for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis. And those calls are an early sign that the accounting of events by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration may face bipartisan scrutiny. The Republican congressman who heads the House Homeland Security Committee is seeking testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Two Republican senators are pressing for more information about the shooting. Meanwhile, administration officials remain firm in their defense of the hard-line immigration enforcement tactics in the Minnesota city,",
