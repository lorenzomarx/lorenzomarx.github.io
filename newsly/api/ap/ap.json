      "description": "Tens of thousands of people are pouring into St. Peter\u2019s Square for Pope Francis' funeral. With hours to go, the piazza is filling up. The farewell ceremony reflects his priorities as pope and wishes as pastor: Presidents and princes will be on hand, but prisoners and migrants will welcome him into the basilica. Francis choreographed the ceremony himself when he revised and simplified the Vatican\u2019s funeral rites and rituals last year. He aimed to emphasize the pope\u2019s role as a mere priest and not \u201ca powerful man of this world.\u201d Francis is breaking with recent tradition and will be buried in the St. Mary Major Basilica.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump will be among more than 50 heads of state and other dignitaries attending the funeral for Pope Francis in Vatican City on Saturday. The late pontiff disagreed with Trump's approach on issues like immigration and the treatment of migrants. But after Francis died earlier this week, Trump remembered him as a \u201cgood man\u201d who \u201cloved the world.\u201d Trump said he'll be \u201cseeing a lot of people\" on the sidelines of the funeral who are \u201cimportant in what we're doing.\u201d Trump is working to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and negotiate trade agreements with multiple countries.",

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials said three people were killed overnight by Russian attacks across Ukraine. The attacks came hours before U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Vatican City on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis. The presidents met at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for about 15 minutes and agreed to continue negotiations later on Saturday, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nykyforov said.",

A provincial disaster management official told Iranian state television there were injuries in Saturday's blast, without elaborating. He added that first responders were trying to reach the area while others were attempting to evacuate the site. The official said the blast came from containers at Rajaei port in the city. Social media videos showed a huge plume of black smoke. Rajaei port mainly handles container traffic and also has oil tanks and other petrochemical facilities.",

      "description": "An AP-NORC poll finds many Americans don't agree with President Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to quickly enact his agenda, and even Republicans aren't overwhelmingly convinced his attention has been in the right place. Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Trump has been mostly focusing on the wrong priorities as to say he's been focusing on the right ones. The findings suggest Democrats are even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in. While about 7 in 10 Republicans say Trump has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president so far, only about half say he\u2019s emphasized the right things.",

The cross-border fire followed a gun attack on tourists in Kashmir that India blames Pakistan for. It was the worst assault targeting civilians in the restive region for years. Pakistan denies involvement. The killings set off tit-for-tat measures on visas, treaties and diplomats. India said Saturday that its troops responded appropriately during the overnight firing. In the past, each side has accused the other of starting border skirmishes in the Himalayan region, which both claim in its entirety.",

Sanders' slide into Day 3 of the draft is surprising given that many draft analysts considered it a possibility that he'd be chosen first overall, an honor that went to Cam Ward instead. Four other quarterbacks have been drafted ahead of Sanders, who completed nearly 72% of his passes in Boulder but took 94 sacks.",

Prime Minister Mark Carney and the governing Liberal Party appeared poised for a historic election defeat until Trump slapped heavy tariffs on Canada and began threatening its sovereignty. The opposition Conservative Party and its firebrand leader, Pierre Poilievre, had hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity cratered as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But the vote is now expected to focus on who's best equipped to deal with Trump. Voters head to the polls Monday.",
