      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed the planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that any peace deal excluding Kyiv would lead to \u201cdead solutions.\u201d The meeting, scheduled for Friday in Alaska, is seen as a potential breakthrough after weeks of expressing frustration that more was not being done to quell the fighting. In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, enshrined in the constitution, must be non-negotiable and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine\u2019s voice at the table.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's promised law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., did not appear to happen as scheduled on its first night. The streets were bustling with revelers, but there was no visible increase in law enforcement. Trump had announced a security lockdown starting at midnight, following a weekend assault on a government official. He has threatened to take federal control of the city, citing safety concerns. Mayor Muriel Bowser has not publicly responded. Trump's plans could include deploying the National Guard, but further actions may face legal challenges. The situation remains fluid as the city awaits further developments.",

      "description": "Israel says it plans to take over Gaza City in another escalation of its 22-month war with Hamas. The decision, made after a late-night meeting of top officials, drew Palestinian rejection, fueled mounting international calls to end the war and provoked worries in Israel over the fate of hostages still held by Hamas. Israel\u2019s air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. Another major ground operation would almost certainly exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe. Hamas in a statement rebuffed Netanyahu\u2019s plans and vowed remain defiant.",

Survivors in the Japanese city will commemorate the anniversary Saturday by passing on their stories and telling younger people it remains relevant to their future. Survivors increasingly worry the world is moving in the opposite direction. The atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed some 70,000 people three days after the bombing of Hiroshima that killed 140,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II.",

A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil. That price is now expected to plummet. The U.S. is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year.",

All residents have been allowed to return home. Aude prefect Christian Pouget said the fire has been contained since Thursday after burning some 62 square miles. All roads have been reopened, but there's a strict ban on accessing the forest. The blaze left one person dead and injured 25 others, including 19 firefighters. High temperatures are expected to complicate efforts. Southern Europe has seen multiple large fires this summer, with climate change worsening conditions.",

Kershaw, 37, started his 443rd game \u2014 all for the Los Angeles Dodgers over 18 seasons. Once teammates in Los Angeles, both pitchers have won three Cy Young Awards and are likely headed to the Hall of Fame. Kershaw allowed one run and seven hits, striking out four. Scherzer gave up two runs and six hits, striking out five. A two-run homer by Mookie Betts gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead. It was the fourth time Scherzer and Kershaw faced each other.
