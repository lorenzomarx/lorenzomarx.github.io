      "description": "Former President Joe Biden's office says he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Biden was seen last week by doctors after urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was found. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone. His office said Sunday this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, but the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that his decision to resume aid to Gaza came from pressure from allies. In a video statement posted to social media, Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel\u2019s allies had voiced concern about \u201cimages of hunger\u201d and said they told the country that \u201cwith that, we will not be able to support you.\u201d Netanyahu said the aid that would be let in would be \u201cminimal,\u201d without specifying precisely when it would resume. Israel on Sunday said it would resume aid deliveries into the war-battered territory after a complete halt on imports since early March.",

Vance\u2019s motorcade was seen entering Vatican City just after 7:30 a.m. Monday. Vance is a Catholic convert who had led the U.S. delegation to the formal Mass opening the pontificate of the first American pope. The Vatican has been largely sidelined during the first three years of Russia\u2019s war and is offering to host any peace talks while continuing humanitarian efforts to facilitate prisoner swaps and reunite Ukrainian children taken by Russia.",

The Associated Press spoke with more than a dozen aid workers. Some have years of experience in international emergencies. They say Gaza\u2019s catastrophe is among the worst they have ever seen. They say it's more painful because it\u2019s man-made. Israel late Sunday said it would allow a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food, saying it didn't want a hunger crisis to jeopardize its new military offensive. Aid workers also are worried by Israel's moves to impose a new aid system in Gaza. They say it won't work and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon.",

Trump expressed his hopes for a \u201cproductive day\u201d Monday \u2014 and a ceasefire \u2014 in a social media post over the weekend. His effort will also include calls to NATO leaders. Trump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022. That makes these conversations a serious test of his reputation as a dealmaker after having claimed he'd quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, or even before he took office.",

The decision by the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office, announced on Monday in an online statement, is the latest in the unrelenting crackdown on Kremlin critics, journalists and activists that intensified to unprecedented levels after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The House Budget Committee will hold a rare Sunday night committee meeting after that same panel voted against advancing the measure two days earlier. Speaker Mike Johnson is looking to reverse that setback, get the bill out of the committee and bring it to a vote in the full House before the end of the week. Deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers on the budget panel in voting against reporting the measure to the full House. Five Republicans voted no, one on procedural grounds, the other four voicing concerns about the bill\u2019s impact on federal budget deficits.",
