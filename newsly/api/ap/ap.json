      "description": "Six of the Group of Seven leaders will try to show the wealthy nations\u2019 club still has the clout to shape world events despite the early departure of President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney and his counterparts from the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Japan will be joined Tuesday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO chief Mark Rutte to discuss Russia\u2019s relentless war on its neighbor. That's just one of several crises in an increasingly unstable world. Another is a dangerous showdown between Israel and Iran. Trump left the summit in the Canadian Rockies saying it was very important for him to return.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s air campaign on Iran\u2019s capital appeared to broaden on the fourth day of an intensifying conflict as U.S. President Donald Trump posted an ominous message warning residents of the city to evacuate. Earlier, the Israeli military called for the some 330,000 residents of a neighborhood in the city center to evacuate. Israel says its sweeping assault on Iran\u2019s top military leaders, uranium enrichment sites and nuclear scientists, is necessary to prevent its longtime adversary from getting any closer to building an atomic weapon. The strikes have killed at least 224 people since Friday. Iran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel and more than 500 injured.",

Palestinian witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli forces had fired on the crowds. The military said it was looking into reports that its forces had fired toward the crowd, causing several casualties. It did not appear to be related to a new Israeli- and U.S.-supported aid delivery network that rolled out last month and has been marred by controversy and violence.",

The shooting at the lawmaker's home has raised fresh fears about the safety of members of Congress. The suspect in the attack had dozens of federal lawmakers listed in his writings, besides the state lawmakers and others he allegedly targeted. The shootings come after credible threats to members of Congress have more than doubled in the last decade and after several violent attacks on lawmakers and their families.

It was the deadliest attack on the Ukrainian capital this year and came as two rounds of direct peace talks have failed to make progress on ending the war, now in its fourth year.

Russia has repeatedly hit civilian areas of Ukraine with missiles and drones, and the United Nations says the attacks have killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians.",

The judge says the jury could begin deliberations next week. The 55-year-old Combs has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges.

Sales at retail stores and restaurants dropped 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, after a decline of 0.1% in April. The figure was pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of Trump\u2019s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.3%. The sales drop comes after sharp declines in consumer confidence this year.",
