      "description": "Crews have pushed through mountainous wilderness in California near Lake Tahoe during a snowstorm to rescue six backcountry skiers who survived an avalanche but were trapped by its snow and ice. Nine others from their tour group remain missing. The Nevada County Sheriff's Office says two of the six were taken to a hospital for treatment. The sheriff\u2019s office says there were 15 skiers on the trip \u2014 not 16 as initially believed. Extreme weather conditions in the Northern California mountains slowed the rescue effort. It took crews several hours to reach the skiers and take them to safety, where they were evaluated by the Truckee Fire Department.",

The billionaire retail magnate on Wednesday is expected to face questions about new revelations contained in Epstein-related documents released by the Justice Department. The 88-year-old Wexner is the retired founder of L Brands. He says he intends to cooperate with House Oversight Committee members' inquiry. As one of Epstein\u2019s most prominent former friends, Wexner has already spent years answering for their association. He denies any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein\u2019s crimes. Wexner's name appears more than 1,000 times.",

It's an early test of whether one of his marquee foreign policy initiatives can gain broad support or advance the shaky ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. Trump\u2019s ballooning ambitions for the board extend from governing and rebuilding Gaza as a futuristic metropolis to challenging the United Nations Security Council\u2019s role in solving conflicts. But they could be tempered by the realities in Gaza, where there has so far been limited progress in achieving the narrower aims of the ceasefire.",

Raphael Warnock says Jackson showed him what was possible and pushed him to fight for justice. Jackson\u2019s 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns led Democrats to open up their primary system. That shift helped former President Barack Obama win two decades later. Jackson also mentored young leaders through his Rainbow PUSH Coalition.

The department plans to announce this latest move to improve safety in the trucking industry later Wednesday. And unlike the previous action last fall to decertify up to 7,500 schools that included many defunct operations, this is focused on active schools with significant shortcomings. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants who shouldn\u2019t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in Florida in August.",

Democrats\u2019 favorability among the party\u2019s rank-and-file plummeted after the 2024 election. The latest measure of how Democrats view their party hasn't improved since then. The midterm elections are still many months away, and lackluster favorability doesn\u2019t spell electoral doom. Other factors could benefit Democrats this year, including broadly negative views of Trump and other Republicans. But the lack of enthusiasm could be a longer-term problem for the party.",
