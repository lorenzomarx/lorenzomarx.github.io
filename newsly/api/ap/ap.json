      "description": "Ukrainian officials say that a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least twelve people and injuring dozens. The attack early on Sunday came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month which have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers on Saturday, a day after each released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Further releases were expected on Sunday.",

And there are efforts in Oregon and rural Alabama teach digital skills to older people, including some who\u2019ve never touched a computer. Those and others are in jeopardy after President Donald Trump said he's cutting a program aimed at filling gaps in the digital divide. The Digital Equity Act was intended to cover unmet needs that surfaced during the country's broadband rollout. Trump has branded the program as racist and illegal, and claims it amounts to \u201cwoke handouts based on race.\u201d",

Israel says it plans to seize full control of Gaza and facilitate what it refers to as the voluntary migration of much of its population of 2 million Palestinians. Such a plan that has been rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community, and experts say it would likely violate international law. The Israeli military said earlier Sunday it intercepted a missile fired by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. There were no reports of casualties.",

      "description": "As the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in federal funding to scientific research, thousands of scientists in the U.S. lost their jobs or grants. And governments and universities around the world spotted an opportunity and launched programs to lure researchers from the U.S. Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world\u2019s leading scientific power. But today that system is being shaken by deep cuts. The Trump administration says it is reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste and realigning research spending to match the \u201cAmerican people\u2019s priorities.\u201d",

The new pope was born in Chicago in 1955 as Robert Prevost. He holds dual citizenship in the U.S. and Peru. As pope he's the leader of the Catholic Church and Vatican City, an independent state. It seems unlikely being pope will force Leo to give up U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department can review the citizenship status of Americans who become foreign leaders. But the U.S. Supreme Court has held that Americans must voluntarily renounce their citizenship to lose it.",
