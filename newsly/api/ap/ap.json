      "description": "President Donald Trump's administration says federal agencies should begin planning to eliminate employee positions. The process is known as a reduction in force. Agency leaders must submit their plans by March 13. Trump is setting the stage for what could become a dramatic realignment of the federal government. He's already downsized the workforce by laying off probationary employees. Now the administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection. Trump foreshadowed this goal in an executive order that he signed with Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who's advising the Republican president on overhauling the government.",

      "description": "The Trump administration says it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world. That\u2019s according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press as well as court filings Wednesday. They detail the outcome of a 90-day review ordered by President Donald Trump of all the money provided by USAID and the State Department for development and aid work overseas. The move leaves few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court late Wednesday temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid.",

      "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday. The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals whose cancellation would save $2 billion. The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 of contracts up for cancellation, and it shows the cuts would have affected everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. It underscores how the administration\u2019s approach to broad swath spending cuts have had immediate and potentially unintended consequences.",

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday the Trump Gold Card would replace EB-5 visas in two weeks. EB-5s were created by Congress in 1990 to generate foreign investment and are available to people who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people. Lutnick says the Republican president's gold card would raise the price of admission for investors and eliminate fraud. The gold card is actually a green card, or permanent legal residency.",

Hamas handed over the bodies late Wednesday, and Israel was set to release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, days before the first phase of their ceasefire will end.
