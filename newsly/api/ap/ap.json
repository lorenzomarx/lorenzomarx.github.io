      "description": "Cardinals are meeting at the Vatican to make the first decisions about running the Catholic Church following the death of Pope Francis. They need to decide when Francis' body will be moved into St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing, when the funeral and burial will take place, and when the conclave will begin to elect his successor. The Congregation of Cardinals, the Tuesday gathering of the cardinals currently in Rome, could choose to begin the public viewing as soon as Wednesday. Under norms approved by Francis last year, the funeral and burial must occur between Friday and Sunday.",

      "description": "Pope Benedict XVI stunned the world when he announced his resignation in 2013, the first in 600 years. That led some to wonder, as he grew increasingly frail and sick, if Pope Francis would follow in his predecessor's footsteps. While Francis kept open the possibility, and even had a resignation letter prepared, he said more recently that he believed that the papacy was for life and pointed out the risks that papal resignations might become a \u201cfashion\u201d or the norm.",

      "description": "Pope Francis never set foot in his native Argentina during his papacy. That left many of the faithful in his homeland feeling puzzled and snubbed by the world\u2019s first Latin American pope. Analysts and Vatican insiders attributed the decision by Francis as an effort to avoid the polarizing politics that characterized his country in recent decades. Francis died on Monday at the age of 88. He was known to have tense relationships with some of Argentina\u2019s leaders. But his stark ideological differences with current President Javier Milei created even more challenges.",

The S&P 500 climbed 2.6% Tuesday and recovered all of its drop from Monday, which came on worries about President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and his attacks on the head of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,021 points, or 2.7%. and the Nasdaq composite climbed 3%. Equifax, PulteGroup and 3M helped lead the way following better-than-expected profit reports. The value of the U.S. dollar also stabilized after sliding against the euro and other competitors, while Treasury yields held steadier in the bond market.",

This raises new questions as to whether the embattled Pentagon head leaked classified information over an open, unsecured network. NBC News first reported that the launch times and bomb drop times of U.S. warplanes that were about to strike Houthi targets in Yemen were taken from secure U.S. Central Command communications. A person familiar with the second chat confirmed it to The Associated Press. The news comes as Hegseth has shaken up much of his inner circle.",

Tuesday's attack appears to be a major shift in the regional conflict in which tourists have largely been spared from violence.

The officers say at least three dozen others were injured, with many in serious condition. The region's top elected official says the attack is \u201cmuch larger than anything we\u2019ve seen directed at civilians in recent years.\u201d",

The court seemed likely Tuesday to find the Montgomery County school system could not require elementary school children to sit through lessons involving the books if parents expressed religious objections to them. The court has repeatedly endorsed claims of religious discrimination in recent years. The school board introduced the storybooks in an effort to better reflect the district\u2019s diversity. Parents sued after the school system stopped allowing them to pull their kids from lessons that included the books.",

A new set of jurors is expected to wrestle over two theories in the death of Read's Boston police officer boyfriend. Prosecutors say she killed him. Defense attorneys say she was a victim of a conspiracy involving the police. Read has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene. A mistrial was declared last year after jurors said they were at an impasse. Many of the factors that made the first trial must-see television will be featured in the second. The biggest difference will be the lead prosecutor, Hank Brennan.",
