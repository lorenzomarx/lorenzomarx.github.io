      "description": "A federal judge in Maryland is expected to question the Trump administration about its continued refusal to retrieve a mistakenly deported Maryland man from an El Salvador prison. A hearing is scheduled for late Tuesday afternoon in a U.S. District Court. It comes a day after White House advisers repeated their claim that they lack the authority to return the Salvadoran national from his native country. The president of El Salvador also said Monday that he would not return Abrego Garcia, likening it to smuggling \u201ca terrorist into the United States.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration last week to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S.",

On the other side is the Trump administration, determined to go farther than any other White House to reshape American higher education. Both sides are digging in for a clash that could test the limits of the government\u2019s power and the independence that has made U.S. universities a destination for scholars around the world. On Monday, Harvard become the first university to openly defy the Trump administration as it demands sweeping changes to limit activism on campus.",

Dan Balmer says Tuesday that his 38-year-old brother, Cody Balmer, has been treated twice at a psychiatric hospital in recent years. His comments came a day after Cody Balmer told a judge he did not suffer from any mental illness. The fire left significant damage and forced Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building early Sunday during the Jewish holiday of Passover. No injuries were reported, but authorities were still working to determine a possible motive, including whether it had anything to do with Shapiro\u2019s politics or religious beliefs.",

The 82-year-old Democrat has largely avoided speaking publicly since leaving the White House in January, even as Trump frequently blames him for many of the nation\u2019s problems. Biden fought back in a speech Tuesday to the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled in Chicago. Biden has made a handful of public appearances since leaving office, but this marks his highest-profile speech and focuses on a core issue for Democrats. Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries says it's \"an all hands on deck moment.\u201d",

The strike hit the Kuwaiti Field Hospital, in the Muwasi area, where hundreds of thousands have sought shelter in sprawling tent camps. A hospital spokesman said the wounded were all patients and medics. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has struck hospitals on several occasions during the 18-month war, accusing Hamas militants of hiding out in them or using them for military purposes. Hospital staff have denied the allegations.",

But the fraud the Department of Government Efficiency is claiming to have uncovered seems to mimic work that federal investigators already reported years ago. And when they looked into the fraud, they found even more. DOGE says its review found abuse including filings made by people with birthdates indicating they were just children, over the age of 115 or not even born yet. The Department of Labor's own inspector general found major problems in pandemic unemployment benefits, which it reported years ago on a scale far larger than what DOGE said it found.",
