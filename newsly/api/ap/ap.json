      "description": "President Donald Trump's administration has escalated its ongoing battle with Harvard, threatening to revoke the university\u2019s ability to host international students, who make up 27% of the campus. The threat emerged as the president called for withdrawing the school's tax-exempt status. The Department of Homeland Security ordered Harvard late Tuesday to turn over detailed records of the school's foreign student visa holders\u2019 \"illegal and violent activities\u201d by April 30. The move deepens the crackdown on Harvard. On Monday, it became the first university to openly defy the administration\u2019s demands related to activism on campus, antisemitism and diversity. The federal government has already frozen more than $2 billion in grants and contracts to the Ivy League institution.",

      "description": "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as an EU facilitator when she meets with Donald Trump in the White House. The meeting on Thursday marks the first face-to-face between a European leader and the U.S. president since he announced, and then temporarily suspended, tariffs of 20% on European exports. Meloni is traveling in her role as Italy\u2019s leader, but she has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen ahead of the trip. The 90-day pause on the retaliatory tariffs has raised some hopes for negotiation, and experts say that Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in bringing clarity on Trump's goals than in outright concessions.",

The United Nations meanwhile raised alarm over the mounting impact of Israel\u2019s six-week-old blockade preventing all food and other supplies from entering the territory. Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas last month and renewed its bombardment, killing hundreds of people and seizing large parts of the territory to pressure the militants to accept changes to the agreement. The U.N. humanitarian office said that almost all of Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million people now rely for food on the only 1 million prepared meals produced daily by charity kitchens supported by aid groups.",

It was the second massive outage to hit Puerto Rico since New Year\u2019s Eve, when a blackout left 90% of clients without power. Crews on Thursday scrambled to restore power as a growing number of Puerto Ricans called on the governor to cancel the contracts of two companies that oversee the generation, transmission and distribution of power on the U.S. territory of 3.2 million residents.
