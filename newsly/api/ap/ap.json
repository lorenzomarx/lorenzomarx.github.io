      "description": "Israel has identified the remains of Eliyahu Margalit, a 76-year-old hostage handed over by Hamas. Margalit was abducted on October 7, 2023, during Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s office said Saturday his family has been notified. This marks the 10th returned hostage body since a ceasefire began over a week ago. Hamas has handed over an 11th body, but it wasn't a hostage. The ceasefire agreement includes the return of all hostages\u2019 bodies, totaling 28. Meanwhile, aid into Gaza remains limited, with only 339 trucks offloaded since the ceasefire began, despite an agreement allowing 600 trucks daily. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire.",

      "description": "The two survivors of an American military strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean will be sent to Ecuador and Colombia, their home countries. That's according to a social medial post by President Donald Trump. The military rescued the pair after striking a submersible vessel Thursday, in what was at least the sixth such attack since early September. The repatriation avoids questions for the Trump administration about what the legal status of the two would have been in the U.S. justice system.",

This is the third mass mobilization since Trump\u2019s return to the White House and it's expected to be the largest. It comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services, but is testing the core balance of power as organizers warn of a slide toward American authoritarianism. Trump himself is away from Washington at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.",

Some lawmakers predict it could surpass the 35-day shutdown from President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The nation\u2019s 1.3 million active-duty service members have gotten a temporary reprieve. But hundreds of thousands of federal civilian employees are being furloughed and facing financial stress. The travel economy is taking a big hit with tourist sites such as Smithsonian museums in the nation's capital closed. There have been air controller shortages in some cities and flight delays. The longer the shutdown lasts, the more it could be a drag on the economy.",
