      "description": "The Justice Department has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James as it investigates whether she violated Trump\u2019s civil rights. That's according to people familiar with the matter on Friday. The subpoenas mark an escalation of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to scrutinize perceived adversaries of the president, including those like James who had investigated Trump before his election win last November. News of the subpoena comes as the Justice Department advances an investigation into the Trump-Russia probe that shadowed Trump for much of his first term as president and as the administration has engaged in a widespread purge from the workforce of law enforcement officials who had been involved in examining the activities of Trump and his supporters.",

      "description": "An appeals court is tossing out a judge\u2019s contempt finding against President Donald Trump's administration in a case over deportations to an El Salvador prison. The Friday decision from the appeals court based in the nation\u2019s capital reverses a finding from U.S District Judge James E. Boasberg that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. Boasberg had accused administration officials of rushing deportees out of the country under the Alien Enemies Act before they could challenge their removal in court and then willfully disregarding his order that planes already in the air should return to the United States. The Republican administration has denied violating his order.",

      "description": "Israel says it plans to take over Gaza City in another escalation of its 22-month war with Hamas. The decision, made after a late-night meeting of top officials, drew Palestinian rejection, fueled mounting international calls to end the war and provoked worries in Israel over the fate of hostages still held by Hamas. Israel\u2019s air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. Another major ground operation would almost certainly exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe. Hamas in a statement rebuffed Netanyahu\u2019s plans and vowed remain defiant.",

Since Epstein\u2019s 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on Epstein and who knew about his sexual abuse of teenage girls. Trump denies prior knowledge of Epstein\u2019s crimes and claims he cut off their relationship long ago. The Justice Department hasn't responded to a message seeking comment.",

However, new documents show that sanitation problems similar to those that led to listeria contamination persist at three other company sites \u2014 in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. The outbreak that began in July 2024 killed 10 people and sickened dozens more. The company recalled 7 million pounds of deli products nationwide, discontinued liverwurst and shut down the Jarratt site.",

The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to a record. Worries are high that Trump\u2019s tariffs are damaging the economy, particularly after last week\u2019s worse-than-expected report on the job market. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a torrent of stronger-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies are helping to offset the concerns, at least for now. Treasury yields ticked higher.",

This move follows President Donald Trump's suggestions that his administration could take over running the city. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that federal personnel from various police forces would be visible on the streets starting at midnight. This initiative will last for at least a week, but there will be the option to extend. The decision comes after a recent assault on a government worker, and amid Trump's criticism of rising crime in the city. Local officials, however, can point to declines in carjackings and homicides since 2023.",
