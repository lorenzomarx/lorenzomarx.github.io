      "description": "The search is continuing for more than 160 people believed to be missing in Texas days after a destructive wall of water killed over 100 people. But questions remain about the extent of a catastrophe that stretched far past the borders of a single summer camp. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says many of those who are not accounted for were staying in the state\u2019s Hill Country but did not register at a camp or hotel. Abbott says search crews will not stop working until everyone is located. He says the 161 missing are believed to be in Kerr County. That's where most of the victims have been recovered.",

      "description": "Texas inspectors approved Camp Mystic\u2019s emergency plan just two days before devastating floods killed over 27 people, mostly children, at the Texas summer camp. Records released Tuesday show the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but details of the plan remain unclear. On July 4, torrential rain caused the Guadalupe River to rise rapidly, overwhelming the camp. Survivors clung to trees as cabins and tents were swept away. Despite warnings and nearby camps evacuating, Camp Mystic did not relocate its 557 campers and 100 staff. Questions remain about the camp\u2019s preparedness and response during the disaster.",

      "description": "Officials say a union representing thousands of city workers in Philadelphia and the city have reached a deal to end a more than weeklong strike that halted residential curbside trash pickup and affected other services. Word of the tentative agreement came early Wednesday, on what would have been the ninth day of the strike. Nearly 10,000 blue-collar employees from District Council 33 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees had walked off the job July 1, seeking better pay and benefits after failing to agree with the city on a new contract. District Council 33 is the largest of four major unions representing city workers. Its membership includes 911 dispatchers, trash collectors, water department workers and many others.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine came after he privately expressed frustration with Pentagon officials for announcing a pause last week in the delivery of some critical weapons to Ukraine. It was a move that Trump felt wasn\u2019t properly coordinated with the White House. That's according to three people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. The Pentagon announced that it would hold back delivering to Ukraine some weapons because of what U.S. officials said were concerns that stockpiles were in short supply. Trump later effectively reversed the move. One of the people described Trump as being caught \u201cflat footed\u201d by the announcement.",

Organized by 10 major trade unions and farmer groups, Wednesday's strike disrupted coal mining, banking, insurance, and public services, according to workers\u2019 unions. Protestors blocked railways and highways, with rallies reported in cities like Kolkata and Mumbai. Shops, schools, and roads were shut in some states, including Kerala and Odisha. Workers demand higher wages, job security, and a halt to privatization. Modi's government has pushed reforms to attract foreign investment, but unions argue these suppress workers' rights and call for the laws to be scrapped.",

Authorities report at least three mariners were killed and two injured. The attack on the Greek-owned Eternity C occurred Monday night as it traveled toward the Suez Canal. The ship sustained significant damage, lost propulsion, and is now drifting. Five crew members have been rescued so far. This follows another Houthi attack on a vessel Sunday, marking their first assaults on shipping in the region since 2024.

      "description": "The last time President Donald Trump rolled out tariffs this high, financial markets quaked, consumer confidence crashed and his popularity plunged. Only three months later, he\u2019s betting this time is different. In his new round of tariffs being announced this week, Trump is essentially tethering the entire world economy to his instinctual belief that import taxes will deliver factory jobs and stronger growth in the U.S., rather than the inflation and slowdown predicted by many economists. There are three possible outcomes. Trump could prove most economic experts wrong and the tariffs could deliver growth as promised. Or he could retreat again on tariffs before their Aug. 1 start. Or he could damage the economy.",
