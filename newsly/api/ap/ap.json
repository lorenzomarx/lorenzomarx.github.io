      "description": "Two top Federal Reserve officials could dissent from the central bank\u2019s likely decision Wednesday to hold its key interest rate steady, a sign of division reflecting the economy's muddy outlook as well as the jockeying to replace Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends next year. The division could be a preview of what might happen if President Donald Trump appoints a replacement who pushes for the much lower interest rates the White House desires. Other Fed officials could push back if a future chair sought to cut rates by more than economic conditions support.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he'll impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India\u2019s purchasing of Russian oil. Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday that India \u201cis our friend\u201d but its \u201cTariffs are far too high\u201d on U.S. goods. The Republican president added that India buys military equipment and oil from Russia, which Trump said has enabled the war in Ukraine.

The agency said the quake registered a preliminary magnitude of 8.0 when it hit early on Wednesday. It issued an advisory for a tsunami of up to 1 meter (yard) along the Pacific coast of Japan. The quake was about 250 kilometers (160 miles) away from Hokkaido and was felt only slightly. That's according to Japan\u2019s NHK television. So far no damage has been reported. A tsunami watch, which is a relatively low-level warning, has been issued for Hawaii.",

Officials promise privacy and security, but experts warn of ethical concerns. Patients must opt in to share data, digital privacy advocates are skeptical that patients will be able to count on their data being stored securely.",

The request came after the Justice Department enraged some of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters by announcing it would not be making public any more Epstein files. Epstein died in jail in 2019 before trial. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence in Florida.",

The crash involved a passenger plane and an Army helicopter, killing 67 people. The hearings aim to explore how the actions of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army may have contributed to the crash. Investigations have already revealed issues like the FAA's failure to recognize near misses and the Army's helicopters flying without key locating equipment. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz has proposed legislation to require all aircraft operators to use comprehensive location technology to prevent future incidents.",

Researchers traveling in a submersible along two trenches in the Pacific Ocean found tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at deep depths. The finding shows just how extensive these communities are in extreme environments. The tubeworms and mollusks get their energy from chemical reactions instead of photosynthesis, eating tiny microbes or snacking on the products of their labor. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
