Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson will meet in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 they\u2019ve slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",

Department of Justice lawyers say Trump\u2019s executive order and a DOGE memo calling for large-scale reductions merely provided guidance and general principles.",

All of this is bringing hope that the new pope will make protecting the Amazon and curbing climate change central tenants of his papacy. The Amazon is a key regulator of the climate, as its dense forests absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that when released into the atmosphere heats the planet. Chicago-born Prevost, who spent about two decades in Peru\u2019s countryside, was chosen pontiff on Thursday.",

The pope has not openly spoken about his racial identity, but historical records highlight a story of migration common to African American families leaving the racism of the Jim Crow South. Black and Creole Catholics in the U.S. say that a pope who holds these multiple identities is just what the Catholic Church needs to unify the global church and elevate the profile of Black Catholics, whose history and contributions, they say, have been overlooked.",

      "description": "Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade. Trump asserted that children will be fine having two or three dolls instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch. The president\u2019s comments also touched a nerve with parents who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need. Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the administration's trade standoff with China, which produces most of America's playthings. Some smaller importers say they won't have enough holiday inventory without a reprieve in the next two weeks.",
