      "description": "Heads of state and royalty will begin converging on Rome for Pope Francis\u2019 funeral in the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, but the group of poor people who will meet his casket in a small crosstown basilica are more in keeping with Francis\u2019 humble persona and disdain for pomp. U.S. President Donald Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei are among the leaders arriving Friday. That is the last day Argentine pope will lie in state in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica before his coffin is sealed in preparation for his funeral Saturday. More than 90,000 mourners have waited hours in line to bid farewell to Francis, who died Monday.",

It will be held Saturday morning in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Despite the billionaire former reality star\u2019s divergences over the years with the holy leader known for a humble style, Trump\u2019s support has risen over the years among American Catholics. He courted them in his last presidential campaign, and many influential bishops are among his supporters.",

It came during a particularly low point in his papacy, when he was struggling with cases of priests who sexually abused children. Francis bestowed the name after Winfield challenged him with especially tough questions about his seeming indifference toward Chilean abuse victims. In an AP interview in 2023, Francis acknowledged that the 2018 news conference where the exchange took place was the moment he began to understand the depths of the scandal.",

The Russian attack on Kyiv came hours after weeks of peace negotiations appeared to be coming to a head without an agreement in sight. President Donald Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy on Wednesday, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by refusing to surrender the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula as part of a possible peace deal. Zelenskyy has repeated many times during the more than three-year war that recognizing occupied territory as Russian is a red line for his country.",

It's a loss of aircraft worth more than $200 million in what is becoming the most dramatic cost to the Pentagon of the military campaign against the Iran-backed militants. Defense officials say three of the drones were shot down in the past week. This suggests the militants\u2019 targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. Officials say the drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.",

President Donald Trump had called for that and other sweeping changes to U.S. elections in an executive order signed in March. The Republican president argued the U.S. \u201cfails to enforce basic and necessary election protections\u201d that exist in other countries. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sided with voting rights groups and Democrats to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the citizenship requirement from moving forward while the lawsuit plays out. The parties in the case didn't immediately comment on the judge's order.",

Trump seeks to make good on his campaign pledge of mass arrests and removals of migrants, the U.S. immigration detention system is being overrun with prisoners. The overcrowding has been especially acute at the Krome Detention Center in Miami, which last month saw its population swell to almost three times its capacity of 600 detainees. Nationwide, detentions have surged to nearly 48,000 as of March 23, a 21% increase from the already elevated levels at the end of the Biden administration. Complaints of mistreatment are going unattended after the Trump administration shut down three Department of Homeland Security oversight offices charged with investigating such claims.",
