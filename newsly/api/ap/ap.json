      "description": "The Israeli military has issued new evacuation warnings for central Gaza, an area where ground operations have been rare. This move cuts access between Deir al-Balah and southern cities. The announcement comes amid stalled ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Qatar. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says military pressure aims to push Hamas into negotiations. The evacuation zone includes areas where aid organizations operate, though they have not commented. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis, with over 58,000 Palestinians killed since the conflict began. Protests in Israel demand an end to the war and the return of hostages.",

      "description": "Armed Bedouin clans in Syria have withdrawn from the southern city of Sweida after over a week of deadly clashes. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire ended the fighting between Sunni Bedouins and Druze militias, which had killed hundreds and disrupted Syria's fragile postwar transition. The clashes began with kidnappings and escalated into violence across the province. Syrian troops sent in to restore order generally sided with the Bedouins. Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa had urged the Bedouins to leave Sweida, emphasizing the state's role in maintaining order. Humanitarian aid is now being sent to the area. The violence has deepened skepticism among Druze communities about Syria's leadership and hopes for peaceful coexistence.",

      "description": "Republicans are encountering some early headaches in Senate races viewed as pivotal to maintaining the party\u2019s majority next year. Democrats still face the uphill battle in the midterms. Democrats need to net four seats to regain control, and most of the 2026 contests are in states that President Donald Trump easily won in November. But Democrats see reasons for hope in the Republicans\u2019 challenges. They include a nasty primary in Texas that could jeopardize a seat Republicans have held for decades. And in states like North Carolina and Georgia, the GOP still lacks a clear field of candidates.",

      "description": "Japanese voters are casting ballots in a key parliamentary election. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s ruling coalition faces potential losses that could deepen political instability. Voters are deciding half the seats in the upper house, where Ishiba\u2019s coalition needs 50 wins to maintain a simple majority. Media surveys predict setbacks for the coalition, which has already lost its lower house majority in October. Rising prices, stagnant wages, and stricter policies on foreigners dominate voter concerns. Populist parties, like Sanseito, are gaining traction with anti-foreigner and nationalist platforms. A poor result may pressure Ishiba to step down or seek new alliances.",

It\u2019s less than 22 weeks before Christmas, and American businesses that make and sell consumer goods usually nail down their holiday orders and prices at this time of year. But President Donald Trump's vacillating tariffs on imported goods have complicated the process. The consequences for consumers? Stores may not have the specific gift items customers want come November and December. Some retail suppliers and buyers scaled back their holiday lines. Businesses still are finalizing their prices but say shoppers can expect many popular products to cost more, though by how much depends partly on whether Trump\u2019s latest round of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs kicks in Aug. 1.",

The early drought that started in May has affected people, animals and crops alike throughout the Balkan region, causing water restrictions, disruptions in river traffic and problems in agriculture. Consequences of the drought are visible on a plateau on Suva Planina, at the altitude of some 1,200 meters or nearly 4,000 feet. A cracked dry land has replaced the main mountain spring, surrounded by yellow grass and dust. Local officials say \u201cfarmers don\u2019t recall such a bad and hard year.\u201d",

The population of kittiwakes has declined by 80% since the 1990s along the Scandinavian country\u2019s coast. The small seagull species, among others, is under siege from climate change, predators, local fishing and bird flu. So the town of Vard\u00f8, on the remote Vard\u00f8ya Island in the Barents Sea, stepped up to help their weakened neighbors. Three years ago, fisherman Jan Vidar Hansen built a \u201cseagull hotel\u201d out of crates for seabirds like kittiwakes to nest in safely.",

Minutes later, the boat began shaking and then overturned. Authorities corrected an earlier report that 38 people had died.",
