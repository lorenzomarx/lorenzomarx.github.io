      "description": "Disastrous flash floods from a raging central Texas river have killed at least 51 people, a total that may increase. Officials say the death toll is 43 in the hardest-hit area of Kerr County. Authorities say 15 of the victims are children and 27 girls attending a summer camp are still missing. Gov. Greg Abbott promised that crews would work around the clock to rescue and recover victims as rescuers maneuver through broken trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris. Abbott also issued a proclamation declaring Sunday as a day of prayer across the state. Pope Leo XIV, history's first American pontiff, offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster.",

      "description": "Flash floods in Texas have killed nearly 70 people, many of them children. An unknown number of people are missing. Heavy rains fell quickly in the predawn hours Friday in the Texas Hill Country, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Among the missing are 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp. Officials are resisting estimating the total number of missing. The July Fourth holiday weekend likely brought an influx of visitors to the area outside San Antonio, making it difficult to track all the people who may have been in the area.",

U.S.-led ceasefire efforts appear to be gaining momentum after nearly 21 months of war as Israel's prime minister visits the White House on Monday. Weary Palestinians expressed cautious hope Saturday after Hamas gave a \u201cpositive\u201d response to the latest U.S. proposal for a 60-day truce. But the militant group said further talks are needed on implementation. Two American aid workers with the Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were injured in southern Gaza in an attack at a food distribution site.",

Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all European Union products as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. He then threatened to increase the rate to 50%. A deadline for trade negotiations ends on Wednesday. Economists have warned that the U.S. and the EU failing to reach a deal would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. Everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals would become much more expensive in the U.S.",

At least 23 people were injured, and multiple residential buildings in the capital were damaged. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 270 targets and another 208 targets were lost from radar and presumed jammed, but dozens still struck or caused damage across the city. Fires and destruction were reported in at least five of Kyiv's 10 districts, and railway infrastructure was also hit. The attack came hours after President Donald Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and made his first public comments on the U.S. decision to pause some shipments of weapons to Ukraine.",

      "description": "Donald Trump has made tax cuts a central part of his political legacy. There were his first-term cuts. And now the Republican has pushed through an extension of those cuts and added new tax breaks. But the bill he signed into law Friday also comes with significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, contradicting promises to protect such programs. Democrats plan to make that expected fallout a campaign focus, while Republicans argue the bill will boost the economy. Historically, major legislation that's been backed mostly by just one party has rarely translated into political rewards. So the long-term effects of Trump\u2019s tax policy are unclear.",
