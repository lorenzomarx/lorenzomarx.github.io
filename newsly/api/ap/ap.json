      "description": "Israel has received Hamas' latest ceasefire proposal, with an Israeli official calling it \"workable.\" Hamas has confirmed sending the proposal to mediators, signaling a potential breakthrough to end the war in Gaza. This comes after more than 100 charity and human rights groups warned that Israel\u2019s blockade and military actions are pushing Palestinians in Gaza toward starvation. Experts say Gaza is at risk of famine due to the blockade and ongoing offensive. Meanwhile, two Palestinian teens were killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian health officials.",

      "description": "A judge has rejected a Trump administration request to unseal transcripts from grand jury investigations of Jeffrey Epstein years ago in Florida. A similar records request is pending in New York. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said Wednesday the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public.",

Democrats successfully goaded GOP lawmakers to defy Trump and Republican leadership to support the action. Democrats on a subcommittee of the powerful House Committee on Oversight made a motion for the subpoena Wednesday afternoon, just hours before the House was scheduled to end its July work session and depart Washington for a monthlong break. Three Republicans on the panel voted with Democrats for the subpoena, sending it through on an 8-2 vote tally.",

It was not immediately clear if the clash was ongoing.

The clash happened in an area where the ancient Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple stands along the border of Thailand\u2019s Surin province and Cambodia Oddar Meanchey province.

      "description": "Serious armed clashes have erupted between Thailand and Cambodia over a disputed border area. The fighting Thursday included gunfire exchanges and shelling and rocket fire, which Thai authorities say killed at least nine Thai civilians and injured 14 others in three provinces. Thailand has responded with air strikes. It was the second armed confrontation since a Cambodian soldier was shot dead in May. Border disputes are long-standing issues that have caused periodic tensions between the two neighbors. Thailand and Cambodia share more than 800 kilometers of land border. The contesting claims stem largely from a 1907 map drawn under French colonial rule.",

The site, Tinshemet Cave, contains remarkably preserved remains of early humans, carefully arranged and with what are likely ceremonial objects. Experts believe this site showcases a significant shift in how early humans treated their dead and thought about spirituality and the afterlife. Researchers are still studying whether the remains belong to Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, or a hybrid population.",
