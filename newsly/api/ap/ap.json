      "description": "The Associated Press is suing three Trump administration officials over access to presidential events. It's citing freedom of speech in asking a federal judge to stop the 10-day blocking of its journalists. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The AP says its case is about an unconstitutional effort by the White House to control speech \u2014 in this case refusing to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the \u201cGulf of America,\u201d as President Donald Trump did last month with an executive order.",

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols removed his temporary block on the effort to remove all but a small fraction of USAID staffers from their posts and give those abroad a 30-day deadline to move back to the U.S. at government expense. His ruling Friday comes in a lawsuit filed by unions on behalf of workers. They say the rush to dismantle the agency had cut off some staffers overseas from emergency communications systems, including some in danger of political violence in Congo.",
