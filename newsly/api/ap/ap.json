      "description": "The Trump administration is creating a registry for all people who are in the U.S. illegally, and those who don\u2019t self-report could face fines or prosecution. Immigration officials announced the registry efforts Tuesday. They said everyone who's in the U.S. illegally must register, give fingerprints and provide an address. Officials cited a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act as justification for registration, which would apply to anyone 14 and older. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to make good on campaign promises to carry out mass deportations and seal the border to future asylum-seekers. On its website, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service said it would soon create a form and process for registration.",

      "description": "Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility. Families from Central Asia flown to Panama and Costa Rica to await voluntary repatriation to their countries. Venezuelans from Guantanamo Bay handed off on a Honduran tarmac and returned to Caracas. All of it sends the unmistakable message that trying to get to the U.S. border is no longer worth it. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has laid the groundwork to reverse the region\u2019s migration flow. And while the numbers remain modest, an outline of how the U.S. hopes to overcome limited detention space as it gears up its deportation machine is emerging.",

U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, found that while the president has broad authority over who comes into the country, he cannot nullify the law passed by Congress establishing the program. The Justice Department indicated it would consider a quick appeal, saying Trump\u2019s actions have been well within his authority. Here\u2019s what to know about the case.",

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday the Trump Gold Card would replace EB-5 visas in two weeks. EB-5s were created by Congress in 1990 to generate foreign investment and are available to people who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people. Lutnick says the Republican president's gold card would raise the price of admission for investors and eliminate fraud. The gold card is actually a green card, or permanent legal residency.",

Agency leaders must submit their plans by March 13. Trump is setting the stage for what could become a dramatic realignment of the federal government. He's already downsized the workforce by laying off probationary employees. Now the administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection. Trump foreshadowed this goal in an executive order that he signed with Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who's advising the Republican president on overhauling the government.",
