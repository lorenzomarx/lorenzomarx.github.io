The Pima County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement Tuesday night that deputies detained someone during a traffic stop south of Tucson. The department later said a location in Rio Rico, about an hour's drive from Tucson, was being searched. The news was another potential break in a case that has gripped the nation for more than a week. It came hours after the FBI released surveillance images of a masked person with a handgun holster outside Guthrie\u2019s front door the night she vanished. It wasn\u2019t clear if the person being questioned is the same person captured on surveillance video.",

      "description": "Investigators say one immigration official abused his girlfriend for years. Another admitted he sexually abused a woman in his custody. A third is charged with taking bribes. A review by The Associated Press found at least two dozen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors have been charged with crimes since 2020. The wrongdoing includes patterns of physical and sexual abuse and corruption. Most cases happened before Congress gave ICE $75 billion last year to hire more agents and detain more people, but experts say these kinds of crimes could accelerate. A spokesperson says ICE takes allegations of misconduct \"extremely seriously\" and thoroughly vets new applicants.",

The longtime Israeli leader is visiting the White House on Wednesday. It comes as both Tehran and Washington are projecting cautious optimism after holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday about how once again to approach negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump's approach toward Iran. Trump said Tuesday that he wants \u201cno nuclear weapons, no missiles.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office has said he wants Iran talks to include limits on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and support for militant groups like the Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah.",
