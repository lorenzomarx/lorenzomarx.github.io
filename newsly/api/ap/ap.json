      "description": "Top White House aide Stephen Miller says the Trump administration is looking for ways to expand its legal power to deport migrants who are in the United States illegally. To achieve that, he says President Donald Trump\u2019s team is \u201cactively looking at\u201d suspending habeas corpus, the constitutional right for people to legally challenge their detention by the government. Such a move would be aimed at migrants as part of the Republican president\u2019s broader crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Constitution says habeas corpus, \u201cshall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.\u201d Miller is suggesting the U.S. is facing \u201can invasion\u201d of migrants.",

      "description": "The election of Pope Leo XIV, who is the first U.S. pope and has Creole roots, is raising more awareness about the complexity of the Creole identity. The pope has not openly spoken about his racial identity, but historical records highlight a story of migration common to African American families leaving the racism of the Jim Crow South. Black and Creole Catholics in the U.S. say that a pope who holds these multiple identities is just what the Catholic Church needs to unify the global church and elevate the profile of Black Catholics, whose history and contributions, they say, have been overlooked.",

House Speaker Mike Johnson is racing to draft a package of tax breaks and spending cuts being pushed by President Donald Trump. Republicans must decide whether they stick with the \u201cNo new taxes\u201d pledge that's been GOP political orthodoxy for decades or whether they tax the rich, as Trump has suggested.

The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed its uncontrolled entry, as did the Russian Space Agency. The Russians said it came in over the Indian Ocean, but some experts questioned the location. It was not immediately known how much, if any, of the Kosmos 482 spacecraft survived the fiery descent through the atmosphere. Experts said ahead of time that some if not all of it might come crashing down, given it was built to withstand a landing on Venus. The chances of anyone being clobbered by the spacecraft debris were exceedingly low.",

The 34-year-old Carr has played for 11 pro seasons since being selected out of Fresno State by the then-Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft. Carr was acquired by the Saints as a free agent in 2023 but had mixed results in New Orleans, going 14-13 as a starter while also struggling through oblique, hand and head injuries that caused him to miss seven games last season. His retirement comes two weeks after the Saints selected Louisville QB Tyler Shough in the second round of the draft.",
