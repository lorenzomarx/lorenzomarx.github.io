      "description": "President Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Had that happened the U.S. would have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing would have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China. The pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.",

      "description": "European Union leaders are appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to defend their security interests at a key summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. The Europeans are desperate to exert some influence over a meeting that they have been sidelined from. It's unclear whether whether even Ukraine will take part. Trump says he wants to see on Friday whether Putin is serious about ending the war. But he has disappointed U.S. allies by saying that Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. In a statement early Tuesday, the EU leaders welcomed his efforts to end the war, but insisted that \u201cthe path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d",

The Pentagon has announced a review of the AUKUS agreement, raising concerns about U.S. shipbuilding capabilities. The review is expected to be completed in the fall. The partnership is seen as crucial to countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. However, a report warns that U.S. shipbuilding limitations could jeopardize the agreement. Australia has invested heavily in the U.S. submarine industrial base, aiming to accelerate production and support its defense strategy.",

Bowser emphasized that crime has been dropping and Trump's state of emergency doesn't match the numbers. She acknowledged that the city has little choice but to comply. Bowser linked the takeover to the larger issue of D.C. statehood, stating that limited autonomy makes the city vulnerable. Trump's decision fits a pattern of using emergency declarations to rule by executive order. Bowser maintains that violent crime has decreased, a claim supported by Trump's former U.S. attorney nominee.",

He argued Monday the extraordinary move is a response to an urgent public safety crisis. But his rhetoric echoed that of conservative politicians going back decades who have denounced American cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressive politicians, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention. Advocates in Washington's Black community say they had been preparing for a potential federal crackdown in the district since 2020, when Trump deployed U.S. troops during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd.",

      "description": "Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded. Consumer prices are forecast to have risen 2.8% in July from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That annual pace would be up from 2.7% in June and a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to rise to 3%, from 2.9% in June. Both figures are well above the Fed\u2019s 2% price target.",

Trump signed an executive order putting on hold a possible showdown between the world\u2019s two major economies, to allow time for talks. Without an extension, taxes on Chinese imports might have jumped from an already high 30%. Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China but it issued a similar statement about the extension of the tariff pause. U.S. stocks edged back from record highs. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, the Dow industrials fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.3%.",
