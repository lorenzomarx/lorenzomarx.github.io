      "description": "Israel says it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for the territory. Officials meanwhile said Egypt has launched an diplomatic blitz behind the scenes to try and head off the plan. The Palestinians and much of the international community have rejected Trump\u2019s proposal, fearing Israel will never allow the refugees to return and that it would destabilize the region. Egypt has warned that such a plan could undermine its historic peace treaty with Israel. Israeli leaders have welcomed Trump\u2019s proposal but rights groups say the forcible relocation of a civilian population would amount to \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's comments that the U.S. should take long-term control of war-shattered Gaza and that the area's residents should be permanently resettled have been contradicted by top people in his administration. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the area\u2019s residents would only be relocated on an interim basis as the U.S. rebuilds Gaza. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says U.S. taxpayers won\u2019t finance rebuilding Gaza and insisted that Trump had \u201cmade it clear\u201d that the people of Gaza would be moved out of the area only temporarily.",

For most of Keith Siegel's ordeal, there was little electricity or running water. Hostages are returning after 15 months in captivity as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and with their freedom, the first details of their ordeals are emerging. Their conditions are shining a light on the roughly 75 captives who remain in Gaza and are driving the families of the freed captives to pledge to keep up their public campaign until everyone is free.",
