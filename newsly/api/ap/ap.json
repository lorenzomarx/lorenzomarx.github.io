      "description": "Pope Leo XIV has called for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza with the release of hostages and delivery of humanitarian aid in his first Sunday noon blessing as pontiff. Leo said, \u201cNever again war!\u201d from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Sunday. Recalling the end of World War II 80 years ago, Leo quoted Pope Francis in denouncing the number of conflicts ravaging the globe today, saying it was a \u201cthird world war in pieces.\u201d",

      "description": "News that the global Catholic church would get its first-ever U.S.-born pope was welcomed by Catholics across the ideological spectrum in Pope Leo XIV\u2019s homeland, raising the question of whether he might be able to ease some of the deep divisions within its ranks. From U.S. Catholics to the left of the ideological center, there's optimism that Leo will carry on Pope Francis\u2019 outreach to poor and marginalized people, including migrants. They also hope he'll provide a counterweight to the policies of the Trump administration that distress them. To the right, there's hope the new pope will faithfully uphold Catholic doctrine, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and women\u2019s ordination.",

And the very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin in remarks to the media overnight effectively rejected the ceasefire proposal and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15 instead.",

People on both sides of the Line of Control, which divides the territory, said the fighting subsided by Sunday morning. As part of the ceasefire, agreed a day earlier, the nuclear-armed neighbors agreed to immediately stop all firing and military action on land, in the air and at sea. They accused each other of repeatedly violating the deal hours later. The two countries agreed to a truce a day earlier to defuse the most serious military confrontation between them in decades following a gun massacre of tourists.",

Two of the strikes hit tents in the southern city of Khan Younis, each killing two children and their parents. Other strikes killed a child and a man riding a bicycle, according to Nasser Hospital, which received bodies from all the strikes. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths in the 19-month-old war because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the latest strikes.",

Rumeysa Ozturk told reporters at Logan Airport on Saturday that she was grateful for the support she has received and was excited to get back to her studies. Ozturk was held for more than six weeks after she was arrested while walking along a street in a Boston suburb. Her lawyers say she was illegally detained following an op-ed she co-wrote last year that criticized her university's response to Israel and the war in Gaza. U.S. District Judge William Sessions ordered her release pending a final decision on the claims.",

The accident occurred in the early hours of Sunday near the town of Kotmale, about 86 miles east of Colombo, the capital, in a mountainous area of central Sri Lanka, police said. The driver was injured and among those admitted to the hospital for treatment. The bus was operated by a state-run bus company. Deadly bus accidents are common in Sri Lanka, especially in the mountainous regions, often due to reckless driving and poorly maintained and narrow roads.",

Praised as a humanitarian model for the way Poland opened its doors to millions of Ukrainians fleeing the war, Polish society is now witnessing growing fatigue. And the candidates have taken note. Anti-Ukrainian rhetoric is now a key theme on the campaign trail, with right-wing candidates accusing Ukrainians of not being grateful enough for the help they have gotten.",
