      "description": "Israel\u2019s military warned people Thursday to evacuate the area around Iran\u2019s Arak heavy water reactor. The warning came in a social media post on X. It included a satellite image of the plant in a red circle like other warnings that proceeded strikes. The Arak heavy water reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",

      "description": "An Iranian missile hit the main hospital in southern Israel early Thursday, wounding people and causing \u201cextensive damage,\u201d the medical facility said. Separate Iranian strikes hit a high-rise apartment building in Tel Aviv and other sites in central Israel. At least 40 people were wounded, according to Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom rescue service. Israel, meanwhile, carried out strikes on Iran\u2019s Arak heavy water reactor, its latest attack on Iran\u2019s sprawling nuclear program. Iranian state TV said the facility had been evacuated before the attack. The seventh day of conflict came a day after Iran\u2019s supreme leader rejected U.S. calls for surrender and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause \u201cirreparable damage to them.\u201d",

      "description": "Celebrations are planned around the country to commemorate the Juneteenth holiday marking the day in 1865 when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Texas. The observances on Thursday come even as the Trump administration has been removing content about African American history from federal websites. Nevertheless, the day remains a federal holiday. The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire has been holding events for the last two weeks, though the state itself hasn't made the holiday a permanent paid and legal one. Organizers say they want participants to think about how the story of America would change if told by the descendants of enslaved people.",

It is the third time Trump has extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.",

The justices\u2019 6-3 decision Wednesday effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to the one in Tennessee. Chief Justice John Roberts writes for a conservative majority the law does not violate the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same. Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissent joined by her liberal colleagues that the majority \u201cabandons transgender children and their families to political whims.\u201d",
