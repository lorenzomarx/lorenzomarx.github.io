      "description": "A preliminary finding into last month\u2019s Air India plane crash has suggested the aircraft\u2019s fuel control switches were turned off, causing a loss of engine thrust shortly after takeoff. The report, issued by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, also indicated that both pilots were confused over the change to the switch setting. The report did not say how the switches could have flipped to the cutoff position. The June 12 crash occurred in India's western Ahmedabad city when the plane struck a residential area shortly after takeoff. It killed at least 260 people, including 19 on the ground. Only one passenger survived the crash.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is visiting Texas on Friday to assess catastrophic flooding that has killed at least 120 people. Despite his past calls to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Trump has praised the federal response to the disaster. He plans to tour affected areas by air, meet first responders and speak with victims' families. The administration has shifted focus from reducing federal disaster management to addressing the tragedy's human impact. But even though Trump hasn't been as vocal about his push to shutter FEMA, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in recent days has highlighted efforts to streamline its operations.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has spawned state-level DOGE initiatives as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show that they're in step. Critics say some of these initiatives are nothing new or duplicative, while some governors are using their DOGE vehicles to target welfare programs or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The state initiatives have a markedly different character than Trump\u2019s slash-and-burn approach. Steve Slivinski of the libertarian Cato Institute says much of what he's seen is the same mundane stuff states routinely do to save money. Analysts at the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute say some governors and lawmakers are using DOGE agendas to consolidate power.",

Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling party in Ankara Saturday that the more than 40-year-old \u201dscourge of terrorism\" by the Kurdistan Workers' Party - or PKK - is on its way to ending. The Turkish president said a parliamentary commission would be established to oversee the peace process. The PKK has waged an armed insurgency against Turkey since 1984 which morphed from establishing a Kurdish state to ensuring autonomy and rights for Kurds within Turkey. In May, the PKK announced it would heed jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's calls to formally disarm and disband.",

Prosecutors say James Craig bought poison online just before his wife began experiencing symptoms that baffled doctors. After his initial attempts to kill her failed, prosecutors allege he ordered a rush shipment of potassium cyanide, saying it was needed for a surgery. Craig\u2019s attorneys have argued that testing of his wife\u2019s shake containers did not turn up signs of at least one poison blamed for killing her. Craig is also accused of asking a fellow jail inmate to kill the lead detective in the case.",
