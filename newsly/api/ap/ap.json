      "description": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams says that a gunman who killed four people at a Manhattan office building was trying to target the headquarters of the National Football League but took the wrong elevator. Investigators believe Shane Tamura was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building\u2019s lobby but accidentally entered the wrong set of elevator banks, Adams said in interviews on Tuesday. Four people, including an off-duty New York City police officer, were killed. Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested he had a grievance against the NFL over an unsubstantiated claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy.",

      "description": "The man who killed four people in the New York City skyscraper that is home to NFL headquarters carried a note blaming the league for the cognitive problems he developed as a high school football player. Shane Tamura said in the three-page note found in his wallet that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can\u2019t be diagnosed until death, and implored those who found him to study his brain. CTE has been linked to concussions in contact sports. The disease has been diagnosed in more than 100 former NFL players and arisen as an existential threat to the United States\u2019 most powerful pro sports league.",

The officer, Didarul Islam, was working a corporate security detail at the midtown skyscraper that is home to the headquarters of both the NFL and Blackstone, one of the world\u2019s largest investment firms.

Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to abuse underage girls, has requested questions in advance and wants any interview scheduled after her Supreme Court petition is resolved. The House Oversight Committee, however, has stated it will not consider offering her immunity. Maxwell's lawyers have also urged the Supreme Court to review her conviction, claiming she did not receive a fair trial. They suggest she might testify openly if pardoned by former President Trump.",

Yet this authority \u2014 the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC \u2014 stopped short Tuesday of formally declaring a famine. Even though Israel eased a 2 1/2-month blockade on the territory in May, aid groups say only a trickle of assistance is getting into the enclave and that Palestinians face catastrophic levels of hunger. Still, the IPC has not yet obtained data that would meet its threshold for declaring a famine in Gaza.",

The proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule rescinds a 2009 declaration that determined carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health. The \u201cendangerment finding\u201d is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposed rule change on a podcast ahead of an official announcement set for Tuesday in Indiana.

Combs was acquitted of the most serious federal charges he faced, but convicted of lesser prostitution-related offenses. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, argued on Tuesday that conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn are dangerous. Agnifilo noted that others convicted of similar offenses were typically released before sentencing. In July, Combs was denied bail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs hasn't shown he is not a danger to the community.",
