      "description": "Israel\u2019s government has vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Sunday that Israel wouldn't allow anyone to break its naval blockade of the Palestinian territory which he said was aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. The activists had said they planned to reach Gaza\u2019s territorial waters as early as Sunday to deliver aid and raise awareness about the humanitarian crisis in the war-ravaged enclave. An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after another of the group\u2019s vessels was attacked by two drones while sailing in international waters off Malta.",

Israel\u2019s military said it fired warning shots at people who approached its forces. The bodies were brought to Nasser Hospital in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis, which confirmed the toll.

      "description": "Six decades after the federal government ordered Concordia Parish to desegregate its schools, the district remains racially divided. Black students make up more than 92% of Ferriday High School, while 15 minutes away, Vidalia High is 62% white. Yet state and local officials say it\u2019s time to free Concordia Parish and other districts from court-ordered desegregation orders dating back decades. In a stunning shift that reverses decades of policy, they have allies in the federal government. The Trump administration has vowed to lift more desegregation plans from the 1960s. Civil rights activists say it would leave families with little recourse when they face discrimination.",

      "description": "Hackers tied to China's government have tried repeatedly to access the phones of prominent Americans, part of Beijing's sprawling cyberespionage efforts. Smartphones and other mobile devices present significant national security and cybersecurity risks, as foreign government hackers exploit vulnerabilities in mobile networks and apps to spy on people and steal secrets. And people's careless use of mobile devices to share sensitive information is another concern. National security experts say that mobile security hasn't kept up as mobile devices and networks have proliferated, making them a significant vulnerability in the nation's cyber defenses.",

Sharafoddin hoped his wife's niece could follow them to their new home in South Carolina.

Sharafoddin says his niece wants to be a doctor, and it is especially hard because she can't study in her home country under the Taliban, who returned to power in 2021 .",
