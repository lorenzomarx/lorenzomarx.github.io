      "description": "President Donald Trump's decision to pause enforcement of a law banning companies from bribing foreign government officials threatens to upend a half-century of U.S. policy embraced by both Republican and Democratic administrations. The executive order to freeze the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. But it also could tarnish America\u2019s image abroad, allow autocrats ruling over often impoverished people to get even richer and lead wealthy allies to weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too. Says anti-bribery law expert Mark Pieth, \u201cWe are facing a Wild West situation.\"",

      "description": "Eight government watchdogs have sued over their mass firing that removed oversight of President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration. The lawsuit filed Wednesday asks a judge to declare the firings unlawful and restore the inspectors general to their positions at the agencies. They said in the filing that they play a critical, nonpartisan role overseeing trillions of dollars in federal spending and the conduct of millions of federal employees. Congress wasn't given the legally required 30-day notices about the removals, something that even a top Republican decried. Trump has said he'd put new \u201cgood people\u201d in the jobs. There's no immediate comment from the White House on the lawsuit.",

Julie Pace, senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press, called the administration\u2019s move troubling and unacceptable.

Hamas says it won't free three hostages on Saturday as planned, citing alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire deal. Israel says it\u2019s ready to resume the war if the hostages aren't released. Relatives of hostages are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to give up on the ceasefire framework, and to speed up the timeline of releases. Their worries are exacerbated by President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that all of the hostages be freed by Saturday \u2014 and his insistence that Gaza be emptied of all Palestinians and redeveloped as a tourist enclave.",

That\u2019s led some car owners to take drastic action.
