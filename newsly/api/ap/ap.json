      "description": "Texas Democrats prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump. In California, the state's dominant Democrats are maneuvering to counter Trump's Texas play by boosting Democratic House seats in the liberal-leaning state. The rivalry tugging at the nation's political balance is playing out in advance of the 2026 midterm elections, with both parties angling to gain ground in Washington. The Texas map would shore up Republicans\u2019 midterm prospects as the president's political standing slumps. California Democrats are weighing political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state.",

      "description": "Hundreds of remote homes are being threatened by a massive wildfire burning through Los Padres National Forest in central California. Three people have been injured, including a motorist with burn injuries who was overrun by flames. Officials say the Gifford Fire spans more than 100 square miles of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The blaze grew out of several smaller fires that erupted Friday along State Route 166 between Santa Maria and Bakersfield. More than 1,000 firefighters working in hot and dry conditions are scrambling to make progress against the flames.",

Two deliveries are expected this month. \u201cPackages will be prepared rapidly and issued on a regular basis,\u201d NATO said late Monday. The equipment is based on Ukraine\u2019s priority needs on the battlefield. Air defense systems are in greatest need. The United Nations has said Russia\u2019s relentless pounding of urban areas has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians. European allies and Canada are buying most of the equipment from the United States.",

      "description": "Russia has declared it's no longer considers itself bound by a self-imposed moratorium on deploying nuclear-capable intermediate range missiles, a warning that potentially sets the stage for a new arms race as tensions between Moscow and Washington rise again over Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday linked the decision to efforts by the U.S. and its allies to develop intermediate range weapons and preparations for their deployment in Europe and elsewhere. The ministry didn\u2019t say what specific moves the Kremlin might take, but President Vladimir Putin has previously announced that Moscow was planning to deploy its new Oreshnik missiles on the territory of its neighbor and ally Belarus this year.",

      "description": "A new poll finds young people in the United States are less engaged in politics than older generations are. Many young adults feel disillusioned with the political system and question the importance of voting. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows only about 2 in 10 young adults follow politics closely, compared with higher numbers among older Americans. The poll also shows about one-third of adults under age 30 identify as political independents, rejecting party labels. Despite this, youth voter turnout has been high in recent elections, suggesting potential for greater political engagement in the future.",

      "description": "Going online in Russia can be frustrating, complicated and even dangerous. Accessing independent news sites, Facebook, and YouTube is increasingly difficult due to extensive online censorship. The Kremlin has blocked or throttled thousands of websites and apps over the past decade. VPNs, once a workaround, are frequently blocked. This summer, authorities further restricted internet access by shutting down cellphone internet connections and penalizing users for searching illicit content. It's a deliberate, multipronged and long-term effort by authorities to bring the internet under the Kremlin\u2019s full control. Experts warn that Russia is edging closer to making its internet a tightly controlled, isolated space.",

All appeared well until a series of events left the ties between them \u2014 and their countries \u2014 sour.
