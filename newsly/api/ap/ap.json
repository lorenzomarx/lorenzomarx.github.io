      "description": "State media says Iran executed three more prisoners Wednesday for alleged spying in the latest hangings connected to its war against Israel. The hangings happened in Urmia Prison in Iran\u2019s West Azerbaijan province, which is the country\u2019s most northwest province. IRNA cited Iran\u2019s judiciary for the news, saying the men had been accused of bringing \u201cassassination equipment\u201d into the country. Iran has carried out several hangings during its war with Israel, sparking fears from activists that it could conduct a wave of executions after the conflict ended.",

      "description": "In a 48-hour whirlwind, President Donald Trump went from elated to indignant to triumphant as the fragile Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came together, teetered toward collapse and ultimately coalesced. Trump publicly on Tuesday harangued Israelis and Iranians with pique that's even notable for someone who isn\u2019t shy about letting the world know exactly what he thinks. The effort was helped along as his aides, and Qatari allies, sensed an opening after following a half-hearted, face-saving measure by Tehran to retaliate against the U.S. for strikes against three key nuclear sites. It didn\u2019t hurt that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after 12 days of bombing, could make the case to the Israeli public that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was diminished.",

      "description": "The Israeli military says seven soldiers were killed in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis when an explosive device affixed to their armored vehicle detonated. Tuesday\u2019s explosion was a particularly deadly incident for Israel\u2019s military inside Gaza. Over 860 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the war against Hamas began in 2023. Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019s military wing, said it had ambushed Israeli soldiers taking cover inside a residential building Tuesday in the southern Gaza Strip. It was not immediately clear whether the two incidents were the same. The deadly attack came as the Palestinian death toll inside Gaza passed 56,000.",

The Salvadoran national whose mistaken deportation became a flashpoint in the fight over President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies has been in jail since he was returned to the U.S. on June 7. He faces two counts of human smuggling in Tennessee. A hearing to set conditions for his release on the criminal charges is set for Wednesday. However, attorneys have said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will detain him as soon as he is released. It is less clear whether ICE will try to immediately re-deport him or allow him to face the criminal charges.",

Andrew Cuomo conceded New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary to Zohran Mamdani as the 33-year old member of the state Assembly had a tentative lead in the race Tuesday night. Cuomo\u2019s concession came as the race\u2019s outcome will be decided by a ranked choice count after neither Democrat got a clear majority in the vote. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist member of the state Assembly, started to pull ahead with more than an estimated 80% of ballots counted. Cuomo, in a speech to supporters, said Mamdani \u201cwon\u201d and that \u201cwe are going to take a look and make some decisions.\u201d",

      "description": "World shares are mixed as a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to be holding. Investors have shifted their focus to comments to Congress by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rallied 1.1% to within 0.8% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%. Oil prices gained more than 1% early Wednesday after falling about 6% on Tuesday on hopes that Israel\u2019s war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. Lower oil prices could give the Fed leeway to cut interest rates to help the economy, and Powell said it is waiting for the right time to do so.",

Even before landing in the Netherlands on Tuesday, Trump cast doubt on whether the U.S. would abide by Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which calls on all members to defend one another in case of an attack. That came even as the 32-member alliance was poised to enact one of Trump\u2019s chief priorities for NATO: increasing how much its member countries spend to shore up their defenses.",

Holes are emerging inside \u2014 a bit like Swiss cheese \u2014 seemingly caused by turbulence as water passes through the bottom of the glacier or air flows through the gaps that appear inside. The glaciers of Switzerland, which has the most of any country in continental Europe, are fading because of global warming.
