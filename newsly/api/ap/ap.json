      "description": "The White House says President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Tuesday to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts. It's a significant reversal as the import taxes threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers. Automakers and independent analyses have indicated that the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined in a briefing with reporters to provide details of the relief. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who joined Leavitt at the briefing, says the goal is to enable automakers to create more domestic manufacturing jobs.",

      "description": "Canada\u2019s Liberals are celebrating election victory in a stunning turn of fortune. The country won't know until later Tuesday whether the party of new Prime Minister Mark Carney will have an outright majority or need help in Parliament. And the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation projects that populist Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre will lose his Parliament seat. That caps a stunning turnaround in fortunes fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s annexation threats and trade war. Poilievre a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.",

By 7:00a.m., Spanish electricity operator Red El\u00e9ctrica said that more than 99% of energy demand had been restored. Power had returned to several regions across Spain and Portugal as the nations reeled from the still-unexplained widespread blackout that had turned airports and train stations into campgrounds for stranded travelers. Monday night, many city residents, including in Spain\u2019s capital of Madrid, went to sleep in total darkness.",

Cardinal Angelo Becciu\u2019s status has dominated discussions in the days after Pope Francis\u2019 death amid questions about whether he would participate in the conclave to elect his successor. After his 2020 downfall, Becciu had said he would not participate in any future conclave. But in recent days he had asserted he had a right to enter the Sistine Chapel with other cardinals on May 7. On Tuesday, the 76-year-old Italian issued a statement through his lawyers that said he had \u201cdecided to obey\u201d the will of Pope Francis.",

An anti-war stalwart who shares the lessons of the 1970 shootings by Ohio's National Guard troops who fired into the crowd at a protest at Kent State University.

Miriam Haley is testifying Tuesday at the start of the second week of testimony in Weinstein\u2019s retrial. The former TV and movie production assistant alleges that the former movie mogul forcibly performed oral sex on her at his New York City apartment in 2006. Haley initially expressed some reluctance to testify again after a New York appeals court last year overturned Weinstein\u2019s landmark conviction and ordered a new trial. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
