      "description": "Yemen's Houthi rebels say U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port have killed 20 people and wounded 50 others. The strikes were confirmed by the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which did not acknowledge any casualties. The airstrikes represent one of the highest death tolls so far in the campaign launched under President Donald Trump that has involved hundreds of strikes since March 15. Central Command said U.S. forces acted to eliminate fuel for the Houthis and deprive them of illegal revenue.",

That senator, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, accused El Salvador\u2019s government of aiming to paint the picture of a leisurely respite for the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia by staging their meeting with drinks appearing to be alcohol, and angling to set the meeting by a hotel pool.

Representing Iran is Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who like many of his generation is a veteran of the bloody Iran-Iraq war. He rose through the ranks of Iran\u2019s diplomatic corps and served as a trusted negotiator during talks that led to Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
