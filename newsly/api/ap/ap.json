      "description": "Israel has identified the remains of Eliyahu Margalit, a 76-year-old hostage handed over by Hamas. Margalit was abducted on October 7, 2023, during Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s office said Saturday his family has been notified. This marks the 10th returned hostage body since a ceasefire began over a week ago. Hamas has handed over an 11th body, but it wasn't a hostage. The ceasefire agreement includes the return of all hostages\u2019 bodies, totaling 28. Meanwhile, aid into Gaza remains limited, with only 339 trucks offloaded since the ceasefire began, despite an agreement allowing 600 trucks daily. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for talks at the White House on Friday. The U.S. leader is signaling he\u2019s not ready to agree to sell Kyiv a long-range missile system that the Ukrainians say they desperately need. The meeting comes a day after Trump had a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In recent days, Trump had shown openness to selling Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, even as Putin warned against it. Following Thursday\u2019s call with Putin, Trump appeared to downplay the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles.",

In Kwigillingok, where three dozen homes floated away, slightly more than one-third of the residences are uninhabitable.",

The world's largest maritime nations had been discussing ways to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump urged countries to vote against the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday. The proposed regulations would have set a marine fuel standard and imposed fees for emissions above allowable limits.
