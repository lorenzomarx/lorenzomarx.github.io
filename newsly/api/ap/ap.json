      "description": "Israel\u2019s defense minister says that troops will remain in so-called security zones in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely. Israeli forces have taken over large areas of Gaza in recent weeks in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law.",

      "description": "Israeli military raids in the occupied West Bank have driven about 40,000 Palestinians from their homes. It's the largest displacement in the territory since the 1967 Mideast war. Some Palestinians found shelter in schools, wedding halls and other venues. But the holy month of Ramadan is over, and pressure is rising to use venues again. Many people have been asked to leave. There are few other options in a territory under Israeli crackdown. Israel says troops will stay in some urban refugee camps for a year. One local man who has been helping the displaced asks, \u201cWhat will be their fate?\u201d",

Five judges at Britain\u2019s highest court are set to rule Wednesday in a case that seeks to clarify whether a trans person with a gender recognition certificate that recognizes them as female can be regarded as a woman under equality law. While the case centers on Scottish law, the women's campaign group bringing the challenge has said its outcome could apply to the U.K. and have consequences for single-sex services such as toilets and hospital wards.",

      "description": "China has reported that its economy expanded at a 5.4% annual pace in January-March, supported by strong exports ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s rapid increases in tariffs on Chinese exports. Analysts are forecasting that the world\u2019s second largest economy will slow significantly in coming months, however, as tariffs as high as 145% on U.S. imports from China take effect. Exports were a strong factor in China\u2019s ability to attain a 5% annual growth rate in 2024 and the official target for this year remains at about 5%. Beijing has hit back at the U.S. with 125% tariffs on American exports, while also stressing its determination to keep its own markets open to trade and investment.",

On Monday, Harvard become the first university to openly defy the Trump administration as it demands sweeping changes to limit activism on campus.",

That's according to two former federal health officials who would have organized such briefings for the health secretary.

A son whose father was killed in the attack never got to know his dad. One of the youngest survivors who was injured in the attack still struggles to breathe.
