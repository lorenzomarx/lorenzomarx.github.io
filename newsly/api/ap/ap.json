      "description": "The United States has attacked three sites in Iran, inserting itself into Israel\u2019s war aimed at destroying the country\u2019s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe that prompted fears of a wider regional conflict. Addressing the nation from the White House, President Donald Trump asserted that Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites were \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d There was no independent damage assessment. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran confirmed that attacks took place on its Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz sites, but it insisted that its nuclear program will not be stopped.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is signaling a willingness to renew talks with Iran and avoid a prolonged war. That's in the aftermath of a surprise attack on three of Iran's nuclear sites as U.S. officials assess Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and the threat of retaliation against American interests. President Donald Trump's national security team spoke for him on Sunday. The coordinated messaging suggested a confidence that any fallout from the attack would be manageable and that Iran\u2019s lack of military capabilities would ultimately force it back to the bargaining table.",

      "description": "A Michigan police chief says church staff stopped a man armed with a handgun and a long gun, averting a potential mass shooting at a church west of Detroit. Police Chief Ryan Strong said parishioners at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne spotted the gunman driving recklessly Sunday morning and then saw him exit his vehicle wearing a tactical vest and carrying the weapons. Strong said the man began firing and that a parishioner struck the suspect with his vehicle. The chief said at least two staff members at the church fatally shot the gunman. Strong said the gunman\u2019s motive remains unclear, but it appears he was suffering from a mental health crisis.",

The attack was the first of its kind in Syria in years, and comes as Damascus under its de facto Islamist rule is trying to win the support of minorities.",

He could be deported before he has a chance to stand trial. Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador whose mistaken deportation has become a rallying point for opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.

Hodges decision followed years of national wrangling over the issue, during which some states moved to protect domestic partnerships or civil unions for same-sex partners and others declared marriage could exist only between one man and one woman. In plaintiff James Obergefell\u2019s home state of Ohio, voters had overwhelmingly approved such an amendment in 2004 \u2014 effectively mirroring the federal Defense of Marriage Act. That laid the political groundwork for the legal challenge that bears his name.",
