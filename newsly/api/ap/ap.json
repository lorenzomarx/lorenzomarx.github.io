      "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says he's agreed to join Trump\u2019s Board of Peace. Netanyahu made the announcement Wednesday from his office. The announcement came after Israel said the makeup of the Board\u2019s Gaza executive body did not align with Israel\u2019s interests. A statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office said he had accepted Trump\u2019s invitation. The Board of Peace led by U.S. President Donald Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the Gaza ceasefire plan. The Trump administration\u2019s ambitions have ballooned into a more sprawling concept, with Trump extending invitations to dozens of nations and hinting it will soon broker global conflicts, like a pseudo-U.N. Security Council.",

      "description": "The U.S. military has begun transferring detainees from the Islamic State group from northeastern Syria to Iraq. U.S. Central Command says the transfer started on Wednesday, with 150 IS members moved from Syria\u2019s Hassakeh province to secure locations in Iraq. Up to 7,000 detainees could eventually be transferred. The decision follows Syrian government forces taking control of camps with IS detainees after the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces withdrew. The SDF controls more than a dozen detention facilities with about 9,000 IS members. The situation remains tense, with ongoing security concerns in the region.",

The crash occurred when a train hit a retaining wall that had fallen onto the tracks. At least one person died, and 37 others were injured. Emergency services responded with 20 ambulances, and the injured were taken to local hospitals. The crash happened near Gelida, about 35 minutes from Barcelona. Heavy rainfall is believed to have caused the wall to collapse. This incident follows a deadly high-speed train crash in southern Spain on Sunday that killed at least 42 people.",

      "description": "House Republicans are starting a push to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. This opens up the prospect of the House using one of its most powerful punishments against a former president for the first time. The contempt proceedings are an initial step toward a criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice that could send the Clintons to prison. Oversight Committee chairman Rep. James Comer initiated the contempt proceedings after the Clintons refused for months to fulfill a House Oversight Committee subpoena for their testimony in the panel\u2019s Epstein investigation. The Clintons argue the subpoenas are invalid.",

Meanwhile, legal battles over the surge and the local response are also intensifying. A person familiar with the matter said Tuesday that federal prosecutors have served six grand jury subpoenas to Minnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz. It's part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded federal law enforcement during a sweeping immigration operation in Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Walz has said the Trump administration is not seeking justice, only creating distractions.",

Markets appeared to steady somewhat after gyrating following Trump\u2019s threats to slap higher tariffs on eight European countries over their opposition to his push for U.S. control of Greenland. Gold prices crossed the $4,800 mark for the first time, as money flowed into assets considered to be safe havens at times of uncertainty. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 2.1%, the steepest drop for the benchmark index since October. The Dow industrials lost 1.8% and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%.",

      "description": "Handprints on the walls of Indonesian caves may be the oldest rock art studied so far, dating back at least 67,800 years. The tan-colored prints uncovered on the island of Sulawesi were made by blowing pigment over hands placed against the cave walls. Some of the fingertips were also tweaked to look more pointed. Researchers dated mineral crusts that had formed on top of the art and discovered it is the oldest to be found on cave walls. They aren't yet sure whether the prints were made by modern humans or an ancient human group called Denisovans. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
