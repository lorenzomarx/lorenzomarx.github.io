      "description": "Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed at least 34 people, according to health officials. The attacks, which began late Friday and continued into Saturday, hit shelters and residential areas across Gaza, worsening its humanitarian crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested a ceasefire deal could happen within a week. Talks remain uncertain, however, as Israel demands Hamas disarm while Hamas insists on ending the war in exchange for freeing hostages. Meanwhile, Palestinians face severe food shortages, as Israeli is only letting a trickle of aid into the strip.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court has ruled that Maryland parents who have religious objections can pull their children from public school lessons using LGBTQ storybooks. The justices Friday reversed lower-court rulings in favor of the Montgomery County school system in suburban Washington. The high court ruled that the schools likely could not require elementary school children to sit through lessons involving the books if parents expressed religious objections to the material. The decision was not a final ruling in the case, but the justices strongly suggested that the parents will win in the end. The court ruled that policies like the one at issue in the case are subjected to the strictest level of review, nearly always dooming them.",

The mudslide after heavy rains caused a 12-mile traffic backup along the West Virginia Turnpike. Traffic was not rerouted, and many motorists along the mountainous route had no choice but to remain in their vehicles for more than eight hours. People posted on social media that they had no information on why the standstill occurred, that they had nothing to drink in their vehicles or that their children needed to use the bathroom. One lane reopened Friday morning, but traffic remained stopped for hours.",
