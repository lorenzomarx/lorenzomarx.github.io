Savannah Guthrie appeared in a video on Instagram on Saturday while flanked by her two siblings. She said: \u201cWe received your message and we understand ... This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.\u201d It was not immediately clear if Guthrie was referring to a new message from someone who might have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie. The frantic search for the 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie has entered a seventh day. Authorities have not identified any suspects or ruled anyone out.",

      "description": "The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt reopened Sunday, allowing limited Palestinian travel after a two-day closure, according to Egyptian state media. The crossing opened last week for the first time since 2024, a key part of a U.S.-backed ceasefire. Egyptian media reported Palestinians began crossing around noon. Israel hasn't confirmed this. Over the first four days, 36 Palestinians needing medical care and 62 companions were allowed to leave for Egypt, according to the United Nations. Nearly 20,000 people in Gaza seek to leave for medical care. The crossing's reopening is part of a fragile ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.",

      "description": "It\u2019s almost time to crown an NFL champion. After two weeks of hype and anticipation, the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will face off in Super Bowl 60 at Levi\u2019s Stadium. Will Drake Maye and the Patriots capture their seventh Lombardi Trophy? Or will Sam Darnold and the Seahawks earn their second? The matchup features two stingy defenses, two balanced offenses and two quarterbacks who\u2019ve taken vastly different routes to get here. The Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the NFL and have standout players at every level. The Patriots got here because their defense has been dominant in the playoffs.",

      "description": "Exit polls say that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s governing party is almost certain to win a single-party majority in a key parliamentary election. NHK public television and other major networks cited exit polls. NHK says Takaichi\u2019s governing coalition which is led by her Liberal Democratic Party could win more than two-thirds of the 465-seat lower house. The huge jump from the preelection share could allow Takaichi to make progress on a right-wing agenda that aims to boost Japan\u2019s economy and military capabilities as tensions grow with China and she tries to nurture ties with Washington.",

Not all of those incidents have been verified during the ongoing immigration crackdown. But they have heightened fears in a state already on edge. They add to legal groups\u2019 concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s dramatic reshaping of immigration enforcement tactics nationwide. Supporters of the immigration crackdown say the sprawling network of anti-ICE activists in Minneapolis has forced federal agents to adopt new methods of avoiding detection.",

      "description": "The White House is trying to show it's lowering the cost of living, but President Donald Trump has said he doesn't want to see the price of homes come down. He wants to keep values high. That's something in the interest of existing homeowners and they're a key part of his political base. And older voters tend to show up to vote more than do younger people, so Trump's position on housing could be a factor in the November elections. But Trump's aversion to policies that would expand housing supply and lower prices risks alienating younger voters and could hurt the chances for his Republican Party to expand its voting base.",
