      "description": "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Iran had \u201ccompletely violated\u201d the ceasefire between Israel and Iran by launching missiles after the ceasefire came into effect. Katz said he instructed the Israeli military to resume targeting Iranian paramilitary and government targets. Israel said it had identified missiles launched from Iran into its airspace less than three hours after the ceasefire went into effect, after both Israel and Iran accepted President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to end the 12-day war roiling the Middle East.",

      "description": "Palestinian witnesses say Israeli forces and drones opened fire toward hundreds of people waiting for aid trucks in central Gaza. Hospitals say at least 25 people were killed and more than 140 wounded. Israel's military says it was reviewing reports of casualties from Israeli fire after a group of people approached troops. The Awda hospital in the Nuseirat camp, which received the victims, says the Palestinians were waiting for the trucks on a road south of Wadi Gaza. Witnesses have told The Associated Press that Israeli forces opened fire as people were advancing closer. One man says fire from drones and gunfire from tanks came at people, \u201ceven as we were fleeing.\u201d Another says drones flew over the crowds first, then there was fire from tanks and drones as people moved eastward.",

      "description": "Members of Congress are hearing from President Donald Trump\u2019s intelligence leaders about the strikes on Iran. The House and the Senate will receive classified briefings Tuesday, three days after Trump directed strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a day after Iran struck a U.S. base in Qatar. Democrats and some Republicans have questions about Trump\u2019s unilateral decision to launch military action. Many argue the Republican president should've gone to Congress for approval \u2014 or at least provided more justification for the attacks. CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will be among officials briefing Congress. The briefings come a day after Trump proclaimed Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire.",

The former governor is trying to reboot his career by defeating upstart liberal darling Zohran Mamdani and a crowded field of establishment candidates in the city's primary Tuesday. The winner will go on to face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, in the fall general election. Cuomo has been the front-runner throughout the race, with his deep experience, nearly universal name recognition, strong political connections and juggernaut fundraising apparatus vaulting him to the front of the pack.",

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in April saying that commercial truckers who don\u2019t read and speak the language proficiently would be considered unfit for service. Federal guidelines for applying the order are going into effect. They call for enhanced roadside inspections to decide if truckers can reply to questions and directions in English, as well as understand highway traffic signs and message boards.

Oil prices declined on hopes that the potential threat to the global flow of crude may have abated, even after the U.S. carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. A barrel of benchmark U.S. oil dropped about 3% early Tuesday and more than 7% on Monday after briefly topping $78 Sunday night.
