      "description": "Federal Reserve officials are expected to keep their short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday after three cuts last year, ignoring huge pressure for lower borrowing costs from the White House in favor of waiting to see how the economy evolves. A key issue that Chair Jerome Powell will likely address at his news conference Wednesday is how long the Fed will remain on hold. The rate-setting committee remains split between those officials opposed to further cuts until inflation comes down, and those who want to lower rates to further support hiring. In December, just 12 of the 19 participants in the committee\u2019s meetings supported at least one more rate cut this year.",

Rubio has begun his much-anticipated congressional testimony about Venezuela and is defending the Trump administration's military operation. Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings Wednesday of the current situation. Rubio said Venezuela\u2019s interim leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. He said Venezuela will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions, with the revenue set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump seemed to signal a willingness to ease tensions in Minneapolis after a second deadly shooting by federal immigration agents. But there was little evidence Wednesday of any significant changes after weeks of harsh rhetoric and clashes with protesters. Trump made a leadership change by sending his top border adviser to Minnesota to take charge of the immigration crackdown. That was followed by seemingly conciliatory remarks about the Democratic governor and mayor. But on city streets, there were few signs of a shift. Immigration enforcement operations and confrontations with activists continued in Minneapolis and St. Paul.",

Mississippi's Department of Transportation dispatched tow trucks and drones late Tuesday to frozen Interstate 55, where three tractor-trailers had stalled and caused a major backup. Gov. Tate Reeves said in social media post that highways remained dangerous Wednesday morning and urged people to stay off the roads. More than 380,000 people, mostly in Mississippi and Tennessee, remain without power days after a winter storm blasted the eastern U.S. with snow and ice.

Democrats are hoping to put pressure on Republicans and the White House as the country reels from the deaths of two people at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hasn't outlined what his caucus will ask for before a crucial Thursday vote on spending legislation that funds the Department of Homeland Security and a swath of other government agencies. With no evident negotiations underway, a partial shutdown seems increasingly likely starting Saturday.",
