      "description": "Provisional results confirm that mainstream conservatives led by Friedrich Merz won Germany's national election, while a far-right party surged to become the nation\u2019s second-largest. The campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe\u2019s biggest economy and pressure to curb migration, and took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe\u2019s alliance with the United States. The results released by the electoral authority showed the conservative Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.",

      "description": "Friedrich Merz is on course to become post-World War II Germany\u2019s 10th chancellor, the culmination of a yearslong political career that was once sidelined by his party\u2019s iconic leader. The 69-year-old opposition leader of the center-right Union bloc has by far the best chance of forming a new government after the country's election on Sunday. It\u2019s been a late rise to the top for Merz, who has been in politics for decades but saw his ascent to the top derailed by former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the early 2000s and even turned his back on active politics for several years. Despite his political experience, he is heading to the chancellery without previously having served in government.",

They\u2019re facing an 11:59 p.m. EST deadline from President Donald Trump\u2019s cost-cutting chief, Elon Musk, to explain their recent accomplishments or risk losing their jobs. Musk\u2019s unusual weekend demand faced resistance from key U.S. agencies led by the president\u2019s loyalists that instructed their employees not to comply. Lawmakers in both parties said that Musk\u2019s mandate may be illegal, while unions are threatening to sue. Trump over the weekend called for Musk to be more aggressive in his cost-cutting crusade through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and posted a meme on social media mocking federal employees.",
