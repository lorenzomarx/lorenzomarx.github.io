      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s strategy has been to downplay the uproar over the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case as his supporters demand the Justice Department release much-hyped records in the investigation. Trump's problem is the nothing-to-see-here approach doesn\u2019t work for those who've learned from him they must not give up until the government\u2019s deepest, darkest secrets are exposed. Last week, the Justice Department and the FBI abruptly walked back the notion there's an Epstein client list of elites who participated in the wealthy New York financier\u2019s trafficking of underage girls. The Republican president quickly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi, but the online backlash was swift.",

Trump on Tuesday offered a more cautious tone on what to expect after he threatened Russia a day earlier with steep tariffs if President Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t soon end the three-year conflict. Trump also told the BBC in an interview published Tuesday that he trusts \u201calmost nobody\u201d when asked whether he trusts Putin. It was further evidence of a break with Putin, whom he has long spoken admiringly of.",
