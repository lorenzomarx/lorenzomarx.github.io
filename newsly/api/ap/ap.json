      "description": "Two top Federal Reserve officials could dissent from the central bank\u2019s likely decision Wednesday to hold its key interest rate steady, a sign of division reflecting the economy's muddy outlook as well as the jockeying to replace Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends next year. The division could be a preview of what might happen if President Donald Trump appoints a replacement who pushes for the much lower interest rates the White House desires. Other Fed officials could push back if a future chair sought to cut rates by more than economic conditions support.",
