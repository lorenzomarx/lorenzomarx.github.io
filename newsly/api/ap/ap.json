      "description": "Talks between Iran and the United States are expected on Friday in Oman. That's according to Iranian media reports by the semiofficial ISNA and Tasnim news agencies on Wednesday. Oman did not immediately acknowledge it would host the talks. The sultanate hosted multiple rounds of earlier nuclear talks between Iran and the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump officials are working on maintaining a meeting this week, though the U.S. has not acknowledged the talks would take place in Oman. Rubio said he hoped to discuss a number of concerns beyond the issue of Iran's nuclear program.",
