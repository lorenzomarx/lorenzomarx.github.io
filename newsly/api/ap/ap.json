      "description": "After glamorizing tobacco for decades, France is preparing for its most sweeping smoking ban yet. Beginning July 1, smoking will be outlawed in virtually all outdoor public areas where children may gather. That includes beaches, parks, gardens, playgrounds, sports venues, school entrances and bus stops. Health Minister Catherine Vautrin says tobacco must disappear wherever children are present. The law also signals a deeper cultural shift. Smoking has defined French identity, fashion and cinema for so long that the new measure feels like a quiet revolution in a country whose relationship with tobacco is famously complex.",

The winner will succeed President Andrzej Duda who is finishing his second and final term. The outcome will determine whether Poland embraces a nationalist populist trajectory or pivots more fully toward liberal and pro-European policies. Final results are expected Monday. Whoever wins will either help or hinder the agenda of the centrist government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk where most of the real power in Poland rests.",
