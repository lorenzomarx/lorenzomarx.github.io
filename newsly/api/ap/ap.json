      "description": "House Speaker Mike Johnson faces tough days ahead trying to pass a federal funding package and prevent a prolonged partial government shutdown. Democrats are demanding changes to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement operations after the deaths in Minneapolis. But Republicans are making their own demands in support of President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. A partial shutdown started over the weekend when funding lapsed for several agencies. Trump struck a deal with senators, who approved new funding, but only temporarily for Homeland Security until Feb. 13. That would give Congress time to consider new restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Johnson now needs Trump to help push that deal through the House.",

Many citizens are unsure about the current situation, with fears of further attacks and government repression. Acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez faces questions about her autonomy and potential U.S. influence. Despite promises of wage increases, uncertainty prevails. Maduro supporters view his capture as a kidnapping, while opposition leaders cautiously reemerge. Rodr\u00edguez's new oil sector policies mark a shift from a pillar of the self-proclaimed socialist movement that has governed Venezuela for more than two decades.
