      "description": "The risk of life-threatening flooding is still high in central Texas with more rain on the way. The urgent search for the missing continues following a holiday weekend deluge that killed at least 82 people including children at summer camps. Officials say the death toll is sure to rise. Gov. Greg Abbott says more than 40 people are unaccounted for. Searchers now have found 68 bodies in Kerr County, where a wall of water came down the Guadalupe River. Sheriff Larry Leitha says the dead include 28 children. Abbott warned Sunday that additional rounds of heavy rains lasting into Tuesday could produce more flash flooding.",

      "description": "Flash floods in Texas have killed nearly 70 people, many of them children. An unknown number of people are missing. Heavy rains fell quickly in the predawn hours Friday in the Texas Hill Country, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Among the missing are 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp. Officials are resisting estimating the total number of missing. The July Fourth holiday weekend likely brought an influx of visitors to the area outside San Antonio, making it difficult to track all the people who may have been in the area.",

      "description": "The United States is stepping up pressure on trading partners to quickly make new deals before a Wednesday deadline when a tariff pause by President Donald Trump expires. There are plans for the U.S. to start sending letters Monday warning countries that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1. That furthers the uncertainty for businesses, consumers and America's trading partners. And questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether Trump will once more push off imposing the rates. Trump could extend the time for dealmaking, as he has done before.",

The attacks came after a suspected Houthi attack targeting a ship in the Red Sea that caught fire and took on water, later forcing its crew to abandon the vessel. The Israeli military said it struck Houthi-held ports at Hodeida, Ras Isa and Salif. The Houthis then responded with an apparent missile attack on Israel. The Israeli military said it attempted to intercept the missile, but it appeared to make impact, though there were no immediate reports of injuries from the attack.",

U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Netanyahu on Monday. The document shared with The Associated Press outlines plans for a 60-day ceasefire. During that time, Hamas would hand over 10 living and 18 dead hostages, Israeli forces would withdraw to a buffer zone along Gaza\u2019s borders with Israel and Egypt, and significant amounts of aid would be brought in.

      "description": "Donald Trump has made tax cuts a central part of his political legacy. There were his first-term cuts. And now the Republican has pushed through an extension of those cuts and added new tax breaks. But the bill he signed into law Friday also comes with significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, contradicting promises to protect such programs. Democrats plan to make that expected fallout a campaign focus, while Republicans argue the bill will boost the economy. Historically, major legislation that's been backed mostly by just one party has rarely translated into political rewards. So the long-term effects of Trump\u2019s tax policy are unclear.",
