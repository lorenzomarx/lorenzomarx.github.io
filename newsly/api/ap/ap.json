      "description": "Iran and the United States are poised Friday to hold negotiations in Oman at least over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. The talks follow a chaotic week that initially saw plans for regional countries to take part in talks in Turkey. Previous rounds of meetings turned to ash following Israel\u2019s launch of a 12-day war against Iran back in June. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war. Meanwhile, nationwide protests have shaken Iran's theocracy. It responded with a bloody crackdown that killed thousands and reportedly saw tens of thousands arrested. President Donald Trump has threatened to strike the country in the time since, spurring the talks.",

      "description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi says a key participant in the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans is in custody. Bondi says the man landed Friday morning at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. The attack killed Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens and immediately emerged as a divisive political issue. Republicans challenged President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on security at the facility, the military response to the violence and the Democratic administration\u2019s changing narrative about who was responsible. A Libyan militant suspected of being a mastermind of the attacks was convicted in the U.S. and is serving a prison sentence.",

Thousands of children are staying home, often for lack of door-to-door transportation \u2014 or simply trust that they'll make it to school. For some families, the fear has turned into reality. Many parents and at least some children have been detained. Schools, parents and community groups have mobilized to help students get to class so they can learn, socialize and have consistent access to two meals.",

Kennedy Jr.'s testimony during his Senate confirmation hearings that the 2019 trip he took to Samoa before a devastating measles outbreak had \u201cnothing to do with vaccines.\u201d Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations include contemporaneous accounts suggesting Kennedy's concerns about vaccine safety motivated the visit. Samoan officials later said Kennedy\u2019s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists ahead of the measles outbreak, which killed dozens of people. Kennedy has since said his \u201cpurpose\u201d for going there was not related to vaccines. Kennedy was sworn in as U.S. health secretary last February.",

The Associated Press fought for three years for access to the documents, which reveal how the country\u2019s fractured bureaucracy enabled Marine Joshua Mast and his wife, Stephanie, to adopt the child who was halfway around the globe, being raised by a couple the Afghan government decided were her family. The records show the Virginia judge who granted the adoption skipped critical legal safeguards and that some federal employees helped Mast take the child, even as others in their own agencies were trying to keep him away from her.",

It was a rare attack in the capital of Pakistan as its Western-allied government struggles to rein in a surge in militant attacks across the country. Some of the wounded in the attack on the sprawling mosque of Khadija Al-Kubra were reported to be in critical condition. Television footage and social media images showed police and residents transporting the wounded to nearby hospitals. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Militant groups across Pakistan often target security forces and civilians.",

Jon Hallford, who owned Return to Nature Funeral Home with his then-wife Carie, pleaded guilty to nearly 200 counts of corpse abuse. Investigators discovered the bodies in 2023 after reports of a stench. Families of the deceased were devastated to learn the ashes they received were not their loved ones. Jon Hallford faces between 30 and 50 years in prison on Friday. In a related case, the Hallfords admitted to defrauding the federal government of nearly $900,000 in pandemic aid.",
