      "description": "Federal officials have announced an end to an immigration crackdown in Minnesota that led to mass detentions, protests and two deaths. Border czar Tom Homan made the announcement during a news conference Thursday. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1. Federal authorities say the sweeps focused on the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area have led to the arrest of more than 4,000 people. While the Trump administration has called those arrested \u201cdangerous criminal illegal aliens,\u201d many people with no criminal records, including children and U.S. citizens, have also been detained.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Washington is proposing talks next week in Miami or in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. He says Ukraine confirms it can attend but Russia is hesitating. Zelenskyy says major disputes still block a deal, including issues of occupied land and security guarantees. He also says Russia is ignoring a proposed ceasefire that impacts the energy sector. Ukraine\u2019s air force said on Thursday that Russia fired drones and missiles at Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro and Odesa.

The survey also shows that the Republican Party\u2019s political advantage on Trump's signature domestic issue has shrunk since October. The new polling comes as the nation watches the human impact of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, where thousands of heavily armed masked agents have descended upon the capital city. About 9 in 10 Democrats and about 7 in 10 independents say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d in sending federal immigration agents into U.S. cities, compared to only about one-quarter of Republicans.",

Survey results show Americans' confidence keeps sliding, not rising. Kennedy has cut vaccine guidance, dismissed advisers and pushed claims medical groups call unverified. Doctors warn this confusion leads people to skip shots. They say that raises the risk of outbreaks. Polls from KFF and Gallup show trust in the CDC falling across groups. HHS says Kennedy is adding transparency and accountability. Critics say he is doing the opposite.",
