He tells ABC News he loves his son, Liam, and disputes claims from the Department of Homeland Security that he left his child in a vehicle.

      "description": "House Speaker Mike Johnson faces tough days ahead trying to pass a federal funding package and prevent a prolonged partial government shutdown. Democrats are demanding changes to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement operations after the deaths in Minneapolis. But Republicans are making their own demands in support of President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. A partial shutdown started over the weekend when funding lapsed for several agencies. Trump struck a deal with senators, who approved new funding, but only temporarily for Homeland Security until Feb. 13. That would give Congress time to consider new restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Johnson now needs Trump to help push that deal through the House.",

Last year, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to end TPS for about 500,000 Haitians, citing improved conditions in the Caribbean island country. The Springfield Haitian community remains anxious, fearing deportation and anti-immigrant sentiment. Many are staying home, stockpiling supplies and signing caregiver affidavits that might keep their children out of foster care if they themselves get detained or deported.",
