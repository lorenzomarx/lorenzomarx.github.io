      "description": "Canadians are in shock after a deadly mass shooting in British Columbia. Seven people were killed at a school in Tumbler Ridge, and two others at a nearby home. Authorities say the suspected shooter, a woman, was found dead from a self-inflicted wound. More than 25 people were wounded in Tuesday's attack, with two in critical condition. Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed his condolences and announced flags will fly at half-staff for seven days. School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun control laws. The motive remains unclear as the investigation continues.",

The Pima County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement Tuesday night that deputies detained someone during a traffic stop south of Tucson. The department later said a location in Rio Rico, about an hour's drive from Tucson, was being searched. The news was another potential break in a case that has gripped the nation for more than a week. It came hours after the FBI released surveillance images of a masked person with a handgun holster outside Guthrie\u2019s front door the night she vanished. It wasn\u2019t clear if the person being questioned is the same person captured on surveillance video.",

Bondi is confronting a new wave of criticism stemming from the political saga that has dogged her term after the release of millions of additional Epstein disclosures that victims have slammed as sloppy and incomplete. It will be the first time the attorney general appears before Congress since a tumultuous hearing in October in which she repeatedly deflected questions and countered Democrats\u2019 criticism of her actions with her own political attacks.",

      "description": "Investigators say one immigration official abused his girlfriend for years. Another admitted he sexually abused a woman in his custody. A third is charged with taking bribes. A review by The Associated Press found at least two dozen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors have been charged with crimes since 2020. The wrongdoing includes patterns of physical and sexual abuse and corruption. Most cases happened before Congress gave ICE $75 billion last year to hire more agents and detain more people, but experts say these kinds of crimes could accelerate. A spokesperson says ICE takes allegations of misconduct \"extremely seriously\" and thoroughly vets new applicants.",

The longtime Israeli leader is visiting the White House on Wednesday. It comes as both Tehran and Washington are projecting cautious optimism after holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday about how once again to approach negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump's approach toward Iran. Trump said Tuesday that he wants \u201cno nuclear weapons, no missiles.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office has said he wants Iran talks to include limits on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and support for militant groups like the Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah.",

They argue that the trial judge's rulings and a biased court clerk prevented a fair trial. Murdaugh's lawyers are expected to tell the justices at Wednesday's hearing that allowing evidence Murdaugh stole from clients biased jurors into thinking he could be a killer and that there was no physical evidence linking him to the deaths of his wife and younger son. Even if the convictions are overturned, Murdaugh won't get out of prison. He is serving a 40-year federal sentence for stealing $12 million from clients.",
