      "description": "The jury in Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial is set to resume deliberations. The jury reached a verdict Tuesday on all but one of the five counts the hip-hop mogul faces. Judge Arun Subramanian ordered the jury to continue deliberating for a third day on Wednesday. The jury said Tuesday it was unable to reach consensus on the top charge of racketeering conspiracy. It indicated it had already decided about other charges, including sex trafficking. Subramanian, prosecutors and Combs\u2019 defense team said less than 13 hours of deliberations was too soon to give up on reaching a verdict on all counts. The jury's partial verdict remains under wraps for now.",

      "description": "More than two years after the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students shocked the rural community of Moscow, Idaho, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders is expected in court Wednesday to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty. Brian Kohberger agreed to the plea deal in the past few days, just weeks before his trial was to begin, after his attorneys tried but failed to have execution stricken as a possible punishment. The deal drew mixed reactions from the victims' families, ranging from support to outrage that Kohberger would live.",

      "description": "The man charged with killing four University of Idaho students in 2022 pleaded guilty, capping a mystifying murder case that's long captured the nation's attention. The hearing Wednesday described new details of the moments when Bryan Kohberger entered a home and stabbed the four students to death. Kohberger then worked to hide the crime, scrubbing his apartment, office and car before investigators looked over them. It's still unknown why Kohberger decided to kill those students, or if he was targeting all four of them. The now 30-year-old will be sentenced in July, and is facing life in prison.",

The Republicans are looking to seize momentum from a hard-fought vote in the Senate, essentially daring members with concerns to defy Trump and vote against it. The bill will extend and make permanent various individual and business tax breaks Republicans passed in Trump\u2019s first term, plus temporarily add new tax breaks, such as no income taxes on tips and overtime. The House already passed one version of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It's unclear if House Republicans will be able to do the same with the Senate-amended version Wednesday.",

Two U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers\u2019 internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. The contractor who provided the videos said the bullets were fired in all directions \u2014 in the air, into the ground and at times towards the Palestinians.

Wednesday's decision could throw into doubt one of the key pillars of the president\u2019s plans to crack down on immigration at the southern border. But the judge gave the Trump administration two weeks to appeal. In an executive order Jan. 20, Trump declared that the situation at the southern border was an invasion, and he was \u201csuspending the physical entry\u201d of migrants and their ability to seek asylum until he decides it is over.",

Officials say they are reviewing the funds to ensure alignment with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget claimed some grants were misused to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. Programs for English learners and migrant children are among those affected, leaving schools scrambling to adjust.

FDA staff reviewers recommended the shots be approved for anyone 12 and older. But the FDA memos show Prasad limited the use to seniors and certain higher-risk Americans.

It's not immediately clear if those missing worked at the warehouse or lived nearby.
