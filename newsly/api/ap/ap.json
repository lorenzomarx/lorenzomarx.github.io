      "description": "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Iran had \u201ccompletely violated\u201d the ceasefire between Israel and Iran by launching missiles after the ceasefire came into effect. Katz said he instructed the Israeli military to resume targeting Iranian paramilitary and government targets. Israel said it had identified missiles launched from Iran into its airspace less than three hours after the ceasefire went into effect, after both Israel and Iran accepted President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to end the 12-day war roiling the Middle East.",

      "description": "A new U.S. intelligence report finds that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been set back only a few months after U.S. strikes, not totally destroyed as President Donald Trump has said. That's according to two people familiar with the early assessment. The people were not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The report found that while the Saturday strikes at the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites did significant damage, they were not \u201ccompletely and totally obliterated,\u201d as Trump said. The White House strongly pushed back on the assessment, calling it \u201cflat-out wrong.\u201d",

      "description": "Palestinian witnesses say Israeli forces and drones opened fire toward hundreds of people waiting for aid trucks in central Gaza. Hospitals say at least 25 people were killed and more than 140 wounded. Israel's military says it was reviewing reports of casualties from Israeli fire after a group of people approached troops. The Awda hospital in the Nuseirat camp, which received the victims, says the Palestinians were waiting for the trucks on a road south of Wadi Gaza. Witnesses have told The Associated Press that Israeli forces opened fire as people were advancing closer. One man says fire from drones and gunfire from tanks came at people, \u201ceven as we were fleeing.\u201d Another says drones flew over the crowds first, then there was fire from tanks and drones as people moved eastward.",

Andrew Cuomo conceded New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary to Zohran Mamdani as the 33-year old member of the state Assembly had a tentative lead in the race Tuesday night.

Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist member of the state Assembly, started to pull ahead with more than an estimated 80% of ballots counted. Cuomo, in a speech to supporters, said Mamdani \u201cwon\u201d and that \u201cwe are going to take a look and make some decisions.\u201d",

Even before landing in the Netherlands on Tuesday, Trump cast doubt on whether the U.S. would abide by Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which calls on all members to defend one another in case of an attack. That came even as the 32-member alliance was poised to enact one of Trump\u2019s chief priorities for NATO: increasing how much its member countries spend to shore up their defenses.",
