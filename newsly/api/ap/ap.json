Israeli officials say that the bodies belong to Ronen Engel and Sonthaya Oakkharasri. They were killed during Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel has threatened on Sunday to keep the Rafah border crossing closed until Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning all deceased hostages. Hamas has handed over the remains of 13 bodies. Eleven of them have been identified as hostages. Israel said one of the bodies released didn't belong to a hostage. The Palestinian group said that talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.",

      "description": "State emergency management officials say they're facing funding challenges from the federal government that threaten the country's ability to respond to crises. The Trump administration has cut state grants and tied funding to immigration enforcement. And the government shutdown adds to the problem. Last week, a federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop linking grants to immigration enforcement. Some states have seen drastic cuts to homeland security grants, leading to a freeze on the entire $1 billion program. Emergency management agencies are delaying hiring and equipment purchases. Experts warn these disruptions could jeopardize preparedness and response to disasters.",

Giuffre\u2019s family wants King Charles III to strip Andrew of his prince title. The duke\u2019s demise began in 2019 following a disastrous interview in which Andrew sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and denied allegations he had sex with a 17-year-old Giuffre.",
