      "description": "Authorities say a man who wounded 12 people in an attack on a group holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza had planned to kill them all but appeared to have second thoughts. They say Mohamed Sabry Soliman had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday\u2019s attack in which he yelled \u201cFree Palestine. The two incendiary devices he did throw into the group of about 20 people were enough to wound more than half of them, and authorities say he expressed no regrets about the attack. Federal and state prosecutors have filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively.",

Musk targeted Trump\u2019s top congressional priority just days after the president gave him a celebratory Oval Office sendoff marking the end of Musk\u2019s role leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk\u2019s business interests stand to lose from Trump\u2019s bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies.",

Pre-election surveys suggest liberal Lee Jae-myung appears headed for an easy win in Tuesday\u2019s election, riding on deep public frustration over the conservatives in the wake of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle. Conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo has struggled to restore public confidence. The winning candidate will be immediately sworn in as president Wednesday for a full, single five-year term.",

The army said it fired \u201cnear a few individual suspects\u201d who left the designated route, approached its forces and ignored warning shots. The near-daily shootings have come after an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation established aid distribution points inside Israeli military zones, a system it says is designed to circumvent Hamas. The United Nations has rejected the new system, saying it doesn\u2019t address Gaza\u2019s mounting hunger crisis and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of casualties on Tuesday.",

And that led to a police raid that failed to recapture him. A senior law enforcement official says authorities were so convinced about the authenticity of the videos that they carried out a search late Monday of a New Orleans home in which they believe they were filmed. The official said Massey was not at the home, but authorities did locate some clothing they believe he wore during the filming. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.",

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington said Tuesday a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications the bureau's own medical staff deems appropriate. The judge says the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s order are trying to lessen the anguish caused by their gender dysphoria. The Republican president\u2019s order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so federal funds aren\u2019t spent for \"conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
