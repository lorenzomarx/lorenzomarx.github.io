      "description": "Israel\u2019s military says it struck an Iranian nuclear research facility and killed three senior Iranian commanders in targeted attacks as the war between the two nations continued into a second week. Early Saturday, smoke could be seen rising from an area near a mountain in Isfahan, where a local official said Israel had attacked the nuclear research facility in two waves. Iran continued to launch drones and missiles at Israel but there were no immediate reports of significant damage. Israel says its military has been targeting Iran's missile launchers, and estimates it has now taken out more than 50% of them.",

      "description": "The second week of the Israel-Iran war has started with a renewed round of strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility near Isfahan. Talks in Geneva on Friday between European foreign ministers and Iran\u2019s top diplomat failed to produce a breakthrough. U.S. President Donald Trump continues to weigh his country\u2019s military involvement as concerns spiked over potential strikes on Iranian nuclear reactors. Still, European officials expressed hope for future negotiations. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he was open to further dialogue but stressed Tehran wasn\u2019t interested in negotiating while Israel continued attacking.",

      "description": "Former Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil has returned to the Northeast U.S. after spending 104 days in custody for protesting against Israel's war in Gaza. Greeting supporters at New Jersey's Newark International Airport on Saturday, Khalil pushed his infant son's stroller with one hand and pumped his fist in the air with the other. He told reporters he will continue to speak up for Palestine even if threatened with death. Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, wasn't accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. But the government has said noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled for what it deems antisemitic views.",

The white top and blue hull of the 56-meter Bayesian, covered with algae and mud, was visible clear of the sea in a holding area of a yellow floating crane barge. The Bayesian sank Aug. 19 during a violent storm as Lynch was treating friends to a cruise to celebrate his acquittal two months earlier in the U.S. on fraud charges.",
