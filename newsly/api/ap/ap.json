      "description": "The Justice Department says it's releasing more than 3 million pages of documents in the latest Jeffrey Epstein disclosure. The documents were disclosed Friday under a law intended to reveal what the government knew about the millionaire financier\u2019s sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with the rich and powerful. The files include some of the several million pages of records officials said were withheld from an initial release of documents in December. Hundreds of department attorneys have been reviewing files to black out material that could reveal the identities of victims. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.",

      "description": "Journalist Don Lemon has been arrested after he entered a Minnesota church and recorded anti-immigration enforcement protesters who disrupted a service. The protest Jan. 18 increased tensions between residents and the Trump administration. It is unclear what charge or charges Lemon is facing. The arrest came after a magistrate judge last week rejected prosecutors\u2019 initial bid to charge the journalist. Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents in Los Angeles, where had been covering the Grammy Awards. His lawyer said Lemon will \"fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.\u201d",

      "description": "Nurses in Minneapolis doubted federal immigration officers' claims about a Mexican immigrant's severe injuries. ICE agents said Alberto Casta\u00f1eda Mondrag\u00f3n ran headfirst into a wall while handcuffed. But hospital staff found his injuries inconsistent with that account. The seemingly implausible explanation from ICE is just one example of recent encounters that have undermined the agency\u2019s credibility at Minneapolis hospitals and contributed to mounting friction between medical staff and immigration officers. Workers at the Hennepin County facility say ICE officers have restrained patients in defiance of hospital rules and stayed at their sides for days. The agents have also lingered around the campus and pressed people for proof of citizenship.",

      "description": "A federal judge has blocked certain federal agencies from requesting citizenship status when distributing voter registration forms. The ruling Friday is the latest blow to a wide-ranging executive order on elections President Donald Trump signed last year. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, giving states and to an extent Congress authority over election rules, lay at the heart of the case. The ruling said agencies will not be allowed to \u201cassess citizenship\u201d before providing a federal voter registration form to people enrolling in public assistance programs. It also barred the Secretary of Defense from requiring documentary proof of citizenship when military personnel register to vote or request ballots.",

The capital of North Darfur province was engulfed in violence, leaving bodies in the streets and forcing civilians to flee, according to Dr. Mohamed Ibrahim. United Nations officials say thousands of civilians were killed during the onslaught. Ibrahim described the chaos as people ran in terror, desperate to evade gunmen. He eventually reached safety, but is haunted by the brutality he witnessed.",

The collapse happened Wednesday due to heavy rains at the Rubaya mines, controlled by M23 rebels. Many victims remain buried in the mud. Several others were injured and taken to health facilities in Rubaya. The rebel-appointed governor has halted mining and ordered relocations near the site. Rubaya is a major source of tantalum, crucial for electronics. The region has long been plagued by conflict, with millions displaced.",

The casualties included two women and six children from two different families. Israel\u2019s military did not immediately respond to questions about the strikes.
