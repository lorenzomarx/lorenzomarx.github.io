      "description": "President Donald Trump says he and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to begin \u201cnegotiations\u201d on ending the Ukraine war. The Republican said in a social media post Wednesday disclosing a call between the two leaders that they would \u201cwork together, very closely.\u201d The call followed a prisoner swap that resulted in Russia releasing American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, of Pennsylvania, after more than three years of detention. Two U.S. officials say convicted Russian criminal Alexander Vinnik is being freed as part of the swap that saw Moscow\u2019s release of Fogel. The officials spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss the swap.",

      "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says NATO membership for Ukraine is unrealistic. In sweeping remarks Wednesday, Hegseth suggested that the way forward for Ukraine is for the country to abandon hopes of a return to its pre-2014 borders and prepare for a negotiated settlement with Russia \u2014 one that should be backed up with an international force of troops. Hegseth made the comments during the first trip to NATO and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group by a member of the new Trump administration. Allies have been waiting to hear how much continued military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine\u2019s government.",

The report says Wednesday that Ukraine has suffered a \u201cserious drain on its personnel,\u201d even though the number of casualties was lower.",

The vote Wednesday came after Republicans who had initially questioned her experience and judgment fell in line behind her nomination. Gabbard was an unconventional pick to oversee and coordinate the country\u2019s 18 different intelligence agencies. She had made past comments sympathetic to Russia, she once met with now-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad and had expressed previous support for government leaker Edward Snowden. Gabbard is a military veteran and a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii. She has no formal intelligence experience and has never run a government agency or department.",

Faith-based humanitarian organizations that partner with USAID are now facing their own layoffs, furloughs and severe funding shortages. Remaining staff are being forced to choose which of their lifesaving programs can continue without government funding. Two of the 12 largest non-governmental recipients of USAID funds are faith-based: Catholic Relief Services and World Vision.

It was a significant legal victory for the Republican president after a string of courtroom setbacks. U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. on Wednesday found that the labor unions that sued didn\u2019t have legal standing to challenge the program, commonly described as a buyout. Trump wants to use financial incentives to encourage government employees to quit. According to the White House, tens of thousands of workers have taken the government up on its offer. The deferred resignation program has been spearheaded by Elon Musk, who is serving as Trump\u2019s top adviser for reducing federal spending.",

The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, Wednesday\u2019s report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. It has increased from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September. The figures underscore the stickiness of inflation, which created a major political problem for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged to reduce prices in last year\u2019s campaign, though most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs.",
