      "description": "The Israeli military has begun a \u201ctactical pause\u201d in fighting in three areas of Gaza to address a worsening humanitarian situation. Starting Sunday, the military will halt activity in Muwasi, Deir al-Balah, and Gaza City from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time daily. Secure routes will also be designated to help aid agencies deliver food and supplies. This decision follows months of warnings about famine due to Israeli aid restrictions. On Saturday, the military said it would resume airdrops into Gaza. These humanitarian steps will occur alongside ongoing military operations against Hamas. Meanwhile, health officials in Gaza said at least 16 people were killed in overnight Israeli strikes.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to meet with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland to discuss trade. Both sides are seeking an agreement on tariff rates. Trump played golf Saturday at his course in Turnberry and plans to visit another one in Aberdeen, where his family is opening a new Trump course. The meeting Sunday with von der Leyen is expected to be private. Trump mentioned a 50-50 chance of reaching a deal with the EU. The U.S. had threatened a 30% tariff rate on the EU and Trump has set a deadline for Friday. Without a deal, the EU could retaliate with tariffs on American products.",

So has his approval rating on most issues, except for a slight decrease in support for his handling of immigration. The tracker also shows that Trump\u2019s favorability rating has remained largely steady since the end of his first term. Between 33% and 43% of U.S. adults say they viewed him favorably across a nearly six-year period. Those long-term trends underscore that Trump has many steadfast opponents.",

It\u2019s an astonishing figure, but still subject to negotiation and perhaps not the sure thing he\u2019s portraying. He says 90% of any profits from the money invested would go to the U.S. even if Japan had put up the funds. He calls it \u201ca signing bonus.\u201d A key Japanese trade negotiator isn't discussing the terms. It's unclear the degree to which the $550 billion could represent new investment or flow into existing investment plans.",
