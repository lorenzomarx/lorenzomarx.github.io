U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials have said North Korea last fall sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia. But North Korea hadn\u2019t until Monday confirmed its troops\u2019 movements. North Korea\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un decided to send combat troops to Russia under a mutual defense treaty. It cited Kim as saying that the troops\u2019 deployment was meant to \u201cannihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces.\u201d",

And about two-thirds of U.S. adults think he has too much influence in Washington. Musk has spent years building his reputation as a business titan and tech visionary, but the billionaire entrepreneur is expected to leave his administration job in the coming weeks. Musk is noticeably less popular than is the effort to pare back the government workforce. Although about half of U.S. adults believe President Donald Trump has gone too far, 31% say he\u2019s on target and 15% want him to go even further.",

      "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in a yearslong legal battle over an FBI raid on the wrong Atlanta house. FBI agents stormed Trina Martin's home in 2017 looking for a suspected gang member. She and her then-boyfriend were held at gunpoint while her 7-year-old son screamed in another room. But the agents had come to the wrong home. Martin sued the government in 2019, but lower courts dismissed the case. The Supreme Court agreed in January to take up the matter and will hear arguments Tuesday. The key issue before the justices is under what circumstances people can sue the federal government in an effort to hold its law enforcement agencies accountable.",

A light cast its warm glow over the tomb and a reproduction of the late pontiff\u2019s pectoral cross on the wall above it.

Nationwide, Republicans hosted only a handful of in-person town halls during the congressional break. The most vulnerable House Republicans were especially shielded from public view. Some didn't answer their office phones for days. None of them, a collection of swing-district conservatives from across states like Colorado, California, Iowa and Pennsylvania, hosted in-person events that were open to the public. Just one planned a telephone town hall. Others favored smaller invitation-only gatherings with local officials promoted only after they were over.",
