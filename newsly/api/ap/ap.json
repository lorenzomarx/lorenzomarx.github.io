The Republican president is set to speak to West Point\u2019s graduating class on Saturday morning. Trump gave the commencement address at West Point in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The president urged the graduating cadets to \u201cnever forget\u201d the soldiers who fought a war over slavery during his remarks, which came as the nation was reckoning with its history on race after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Trump also paid tribute to the military academy\u2019s history and its famed graduates, including Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower.",

Trump's statement Friday left it vague as to whether he's approving Nippon Steel\u2019s bid after vowing to block it, but investors took it as a positive sign, sharply pushing up U.S. Steel\u2019s shares. The companies issued approving statements, but didn't describe terms of the deal. Nippon Steel\u2019s nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden. One union official suggests the federal government will have a role in the company\u2019s management going forward.",

And overall, one of the biggest challenges facing history\u2019s first American pope will be how he addresses the clergy abuse scandal. But one group of people who are defending the former Robert Prevost\u2019s record and cheering his election are the victims of the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, a sect-like organization in the heart of the Latin American church. They endured decades of twisted abuses including physical, sexual and psychological violence at the hands of its leaders and say Prevost helped when many others didn't.",

It slammed into a home and killed multiple people on the flight. Among them was the groundbreaking music executive Dave Shapiro, a pillar of his music scene, and Daniel Williams, a former drummer for the popular Ohio metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada. Both Williams and Shapiro served as success stories for their rock music scenes, proof that these subcultural sounds had real mainstream appeal, according to members of their community.",
