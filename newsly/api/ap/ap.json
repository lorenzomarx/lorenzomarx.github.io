      "description": "Hospital officials and witnesses say Israeli forces have killed at least 23 Palestinians seeking food in the Gaza Strip. The incident happened on Sunday as hungry crowds surged around aid sites. Desperation has gripped the territory, home to over 2 million people, amid warnings of famine due to Israel\u2019s blockade and ongoing offensive. Witnesses described Israeli troops opening fire on crowds near distribution points. The Gaza health ministry also said six more Palestinian adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours. Ninety-three children have also died of causes related to malnutrition since the war in Gaza started last year, it said.",

      "description": "Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption agencies say they uncovered a major bribery scheme involving inflated military procurement contracts, just two days after lawmakers restored the agencies\u2019 independence following a public outcry. In a statement late on Saturday, they said a lawmaker, local officials, and National Guard members took kickbacks worth up to 30% on overpriced contracts for drones and electronic warfare gear. Four people have been arrested. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme \u201cabsolutely immoral\u201d and praised investigators. The exposure follows parliament\u2019s reversal of a controversial move by Zelenskyy to curb the agencies\u2019 powers.",

      "description": "An independent watchdog agency responsible for enforcing a law against partisan political activity by federal employees has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who brought two criminal cases against then-candidate Donald Trump before his election to the White House last year. The Office of Special Counsel confirmed Saturday that it was investigating Smith on allegations he engaged in political activity through his inquiries into Trump. Smith was named special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 and his special counsel title is entirely distinct from the agency now investigating him. The office has no criminal enforcement power but does have the authority to impose fines and other sanctions for violations.",

      "description": "A video showing the violent arrest of a Black college student in Florida has sparked calls for drivers to use cameras that show a view from inside their car. William McNeil Jr.'s dashboard-mounted cellphone captured footage of officers beating him during a February traffic stop. The footage, which went viral when posted online last month, shows officers smashing McNeil's window and hitting him, actions not clearly visible on police bodycams. Experts suggest that car cameras can offer a unique perspective and protect against false claims. The arrest has led to discussions about police accountability and the limitations of bodycams.",

The energetic pastor preaches in sign language, and the vibrations of drums signal when to pray or kneel. The church and its handful of affiliates in Africa's most populous country was founded in the colonial era. An estimated 10 million of the population of 220 million are deaf or have difficulty hearing. But advocates struggle to ensure more infrastructure for deaf people and blame a lack of political will. Members call the church a haven, and its sign language lessons open the door to the wider world.",
