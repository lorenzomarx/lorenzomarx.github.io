      "description": "Pope Francis\u2019 body will be moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to lie in state allowing the Catholic faithful to pay their respects to the Argentine pope. Francis is being remembered for his humble style, concern for the poor and insistent prayers for peace. Heads of state are expected for the funeral Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square. But the three days of public viewing are largely for ordinary Catholics to mourn the 88-year-old pope. Francis died Monday after suffering a stroke. His body will be transferred Wednesday morning to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The public mourning period will end on Friday night.",

An Israeli strike on the Gaza Strip overnight into Wednesday killed 23 people, according to local health authorities. Egypt and Qatar are still developing the proposal, which would include the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the entire strip and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas would also hand over power to a committee of independent technocrats. Israel and the United States have ruled out any proposal that would allow Hamas to retain influence in Gaza and rearm.",

Tens of thousands of armed police and soldiers fanned out across the region and erected additional checkpoints.
