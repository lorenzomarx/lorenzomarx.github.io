      "description": "House Republicans are sprinting toward a vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cuts package. The Republicans are looking to seize momentum from a hard-fought vote in the Senate, essentially daring members with concerns to defy Trump and vote against it. The bill will extend and make permanent various individual and business tax breaks Republicans passed in Trump\u2019s first term, plus temporarily add new tax breaks, such as no income taxes on tips and overtime. The House already passed one version of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It's unclear if House Republicans will be able to do the same with the Senate-amended version Wednesday.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump keeps saying that Republicans\u2019 mega tax and spending cut legislation will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits. It does not. Instead of eliminating the tax, the Senate and House have each passed their own versions of a temporary tax deduction for seniors aged 65 and over, which applies to all income \u2014 not just Social Security. And it turns out not all Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction. Those who won\u2019t be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don\u2019t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.",

      "description": "Hamas has signaled openness to a ceasefire with Israel but insists any deal must end the war in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced Israel's agreement to a 60-day ceasefire plan. Trump urged Hamas to accept it before conditions worsen. A Hamas official on Wednesday stopped short of accepting the proposal announced by Trump. Israel hasn't publicly commented but maintains it will only end the war if Hamas surrenders and disarms. But Hamas refuses to do so. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to travel to the White House next week to discuss Gaza and other matters.",

      "description": "Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has said the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending speculation ignited by his remark that he might be the last person to hold the role. Speaking at prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said in a recorded statement the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized following Buddhist traditions. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated. His succession plan is politically consequential for Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of the territory. China has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.",

Catalan regional president Salvador Illa announced the deaths in a social media post around midnight on Tuesday. The fire came amid a European heat wave that's sending thermometers soaring again on Wednesday. A total of 6,500 hectares or 16,000 acres was burned before firefighters established a perimeter and declared the blaze under control. About 14,000 people were ordered to stay indoors. That order was lifted late Tuesday.",

That is scattering Kyiv\u2019s precious reserve troops and threatening to expand the fighting to a new Ukrainian region as each side seeks an advantage before the fighting season wanes in the autumn. Analysts and military commanders say Moscow aims to maximize its territorial gains before seriously considering a full ceasefire. Ukraine wants to slow the Russian advance for as long as possible and extract heavy losses. Kremlin forces are steadily gaining ground in the eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Its capture would hand them a major battlefield victory. The fighting there has also brought combat to the border of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region.",

      "description": "An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans. That could be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The JPMorganChase Institute analysis is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue. This category includes a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand. The retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the Republican president's import taxes. Trump claims foreign manufacturers will absorb the costs.",
