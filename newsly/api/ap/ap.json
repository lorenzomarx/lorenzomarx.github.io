      "description": "The House is expected to approve President Donald Trump\u2019s request to claw back about $9 billion for public broadcasting and foreign aid. A final vote to approve the spending cuts package is scheduled for Thursday evening. Republicans are targeting institutions and programs they view as bloated or out of step with their agenda. The White House has described the package as a test case and says if Congress goes along, more requests will come. The House\u2019s approval would mark the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a request to Congress.",

      "description": "The controversy over President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation entered a new dimension Thursday as his administration struggles to make good on its promises to release details on the sex trafficking case involving a one-time friend of the now-president. Trump threatened a lawsuit after The Wall Street Journal on Thursday described a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump\u2019s name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday. Trump denied writing the letter. Trump in recent days has berated supporters vying for more records from the Epstein probe, after years of courting political support from those who have stoked claims of a coverup in the case.",

      "description": "House Republicans are trying to formulate a response to the Trump administration\u2019s handling of records in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. They ultimately put forward a resolution Thursday that carried no legal weight but nodded to the growing demand for greater transparency. The House resolution could potentially be voted on next week. It will do practically nothing to force the Justice Department to release more records in the case. Still, the Republican response showed how backlash from the Republican base is putting pressure on the Trump administration and roiling GOP lawmakers.",

      "description": "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency. It\u2019s a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. It happens when veins in the legs can\u2019t properly carry blood back to the heart, which can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight.",

Israeli strikes targeting government troops did not immediately stop.

Her death was announced Thursday by her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, who didn't immediately provide additional details. Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \u201cWho\u2019s Sorry Now?\u201d and including the No. 1 songs \u201cDon\u2019t Break the Heart That Loves You\u201d and \u201cThe Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\u201d",
