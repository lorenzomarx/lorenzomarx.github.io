      "description": "Former President Joe Biden's office says he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Biden was seen last week by doctors after urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was found. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone. His office said Sunday this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, but the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.",

The race pitted front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. It was held months after the cancellation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades.

The union says the engineers and the transit agency came to an agreement Sunday and trains would resume running their regular schedules on Tuesday. The main sticking point had been achieving a wage increase for the engineers without creating a financially disastrous domino effect for the transit agency. It was the state\u2019s first transit strike in over 40 years, forcing people who normally rely on New Jersey Transit to find alternative transport or consider staying home.",

The House Budget Committee will hold a rare Sunday night committee meeting after that same panel voted against advancing the measure two days earlier. Speaker Mike Johnson is looking to reverse that setback, get the bill out of the committee and bring it to a vote in the full House before the end of the week. Deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers on the budget panel in voting against reporting the measure to the full House. Five Republicans voted no, one on procedural grounds, the other four voicing concerns about the bill\u2019s impact on federal budget deficits.",
