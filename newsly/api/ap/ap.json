      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly said during his campaign he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin 24 hours\u201d upon taking office. But since his Jan. 20 inauguration, the road to a peace deal has been fraught with changing dynamics between the U.S. leader, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward both Zelenskyy and Putin has evolved during the first months of his second term in the White House. The Republican leader has become increasingly exasperated with Putin in recent days, while he appears to have softened toward Zelenskyy after a February blowout in the Oval Office.",

      "description": "Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced he will run for New York City mayor as an independent candidate. Cuomo, who lost to progressive Democrat Zohran Mamdani in the June primary, says he aims to challenge Mamdani\u2019s policies, calling them \u201cslick slogans with no real solutions.\u201d The general election is set for November. The current Mayor Eric Adams is also running as an independent, while Curtis Sliwa is set to represent the Republican Party. Critics of Mamdani\u2019s progressive agenda worry that multiple candidates could split the anti-Mamdani vote, boosting his chances. This marks Cuomo\u2019s latest comeback attempt after resigning as governor amid scandal.",

Right-wing influencers were once bolstered by Trump\u2019s own claims on this case, but are now feeling their demands are being squelched by his administration.

      "description": "A wildfire along the Grand Canyon's North Rim grew rapidly over the weekend and destroyed a historic lodge and visitors center. Firefighters are working to slow down the fire that began on July 4 after a lightning trike. The fire is in a less popular area of the Grand Canyon that draws only about 10% of the park's millions of visitors. Evacuations were ordered over concerns that include chlorine gas exposure after a treatment plant burned. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has called for a federal investigation into the fire's management. Another wildfire in Colorado has closed Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, prompting evacuations and a disaster declaration by the state\u2019s governor.",

The interior ministry said Monday that military forces will deploy to restore order. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 37 deaths and said the violence began after kidnappings and robberies escalated tensions between Druze and Sunni Bedouin groups. The ministry called the situation a dangerous escalation fueled by the absence of effective governance. Sweida is home to Syria\u2019s Druze minority and has seen unrest since the fall of former leader Bashar Assad, with Druze factions divided over integrating with the new government.",

      "description": "Fast fashion relies heavily on synthetic fibers that are made from oil and gas, fossil fuels that cause climate change. Once discarded, many of those materials end up in landfills. Some designers are working to cut those products out completely and instead use biomaterials. They are experimenting with tapioca, gelatin, agar agar, mushrooms, and other kitchen-shelf ingredients. Big names like Stella McCartney and Hermes have experimented with biomaterials like mushroom leather, while other early adopters are making fabrics out of corn and soy. Some experts are skeptical these textiles can be scaled up, but designers experimenting with biomaterials believe their experimentation could help push the industry away from the heavy pollution and waste that it currently produces.",
