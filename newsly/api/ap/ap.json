      "description": "The Trump administration will present an unforgiving argument for dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development to a federal judge. It says USAID is rife with \u201cdeceit\u201d and \u201cinsubordination\u201d and must be shut down for the administration to decide what pieces of it to keep. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols will hear Wednesday from the administration and from two federal workers' groups trying to halt the administration's unraveling of USAID. The employee groups are asking the judge to keep temporarily blocking administration plans to pull most USAID staffers off the job. USAID staffers and their supporters say President Donald Trump's dismantling of the aid agency is illegal without congressional approval.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign assistance has dealt a blow organizations fighting human trafficking and forced labor in Cambodia, where tens of thousands of people are held captive and forced to work in call centers running telephone scams. A shelter for people who manage to leave these compounds run by the Catholic charity Caritas recently let some victims go and may stop accepting further victims due to the funding squeeze, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said. The shelter is the only one not operated by the government which takes in victims of scam compounds. The sources declined to be named because they were concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump could sign an order as soon as Wednesday to require that U.S. tariffs on imports match the tax rates charged by other countries. It\u2019s a bet that his economic ideas can eventually deliver meaningful results for voters, even if by Trump\u2019s own admission the import taxes could involve some financial pain in the form of inflation and economic disruptions. For all of Trump\u2019s talk, the impact will likely depend on the details of the tariffs and how other nations respond. The tariffs could set off retaliatory measures that could roil growth around the globe and reset where the United States stands with allies and rivals alike.",

It was a highly unusual move that could have constitutional free-speech implications. AP executives said the reporter tried to enter the White House event as usual Tuesday afternoon and was turned away. Julie Pace, senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press, called the administration\u2019s move troubling and unacceptable. The Trump administration made no immediate announcements about the move.",

It\u2019s unclear to what degree the Education Department\u2019s Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk\u2019s team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute\u2019s work. The Education Department did not immediately share details on the cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will not affect IES\u2019 primary work.",

Elon Musk\u2019s company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy in China and leveraged the patronage of political leaders to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability. That\u2019s led some car owners to take drastic action. As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the U.S., Tesla\u2019s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts are by design intertwined.",

Hamas says it won't free three hostages on Saturday as planned, citing alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire deal. Israel says it\u2019s ready to resume the war if the hostages aren't released. Relatives of hostages are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to give up on the ceasefire framework, and to speed up the timeline of releases. Their worries are exacerbated by President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that all of the hostages be freed by Saturday \u2014 and his insistence that Gaza be emptied of all Palestinians and redeveloped as a tourist enclave.",
