      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington. Friday's meeting is a pivotal moment for Zelenskyy's country, one that hinges on whether he can persuade the Republican to provide some form of U.S. backing for Ukraine\u2019s security against any future Russian aggression. During the visit, Ukraine is expected to sign a landmark economic agreement with the U.S. that would bind the two countries economically for years. But Zelenskyy insists on firm security guarantees to safeguard his country. There are concerns that Trump may broker a peace deal favoring Russia. But U.S. officials argue American investments in Ukraine will inherently enhance its security.",

      "description": "Key Republicans and Democrats have been stalwart supporters of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But a blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to sign a deal Friday that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Instead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance further splintered American political support for Ukraine. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has backed Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster.\"",

      "description": "President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office over the war in Ukraine, accusing him of not showing gratitude after he challenged Vance on the question of diplomacy with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The argument, broadcast globally on Friday, was perhaps unique in American history. It led to the rest of Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit being canceled and called into question how much the U.S. will still support Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.",

Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy during an Oval Office meeting on Friday for what they saw as a lack of gratitude for past U.S. aid, a confrontation that pleased Moscow. The friction cast doubt on future U.S. support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia. But despite the diplomatic fallout, many Ukrainians supported Zelenskyy\u2019s firm stance. Officials across Ukraine praised their leader's resilience, while some cautioned against losing crucial U.S. backing.",

But some think the move is just another way for the president to stoke division and fear. Currently, more than 30 states in the U.S. already have laws declaring English as the official language.",

      "description": "A jury has found a 73-year-old Illinois landlord guilty in a hate crime attack that left a Palestinian American boy dead and injured his mother. Joseph Czuba faced murder, attempted murder and hate crime charges in the death of Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen, in October 2023. Authorities allege that Czuba targeted them because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas. He had pleaded not guilty. The family was renting rooms from Czuba at a suburban Chicago house. Shaheen testified at the trial that he attacked her with a knife before killing her 6-year-old son in another room. Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes before handing in a verdict.",

Data released Wednesday showed that consumers slashed their spending by the most since February 2021, even as their incomes rose. On a positive note, inflation cooled, but President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose large import taxes on Canada, Mexico, and China -- the United States\u2019 top trading partners -- will likely push prices higher, economists say. Some companies are already planning to raise prices in response.",
