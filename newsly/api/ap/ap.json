      "description": "The Republican-controlled Senate has advanced President Donald Trump\u2019s package of tax breaks, spending cuts and increased deportation money, but there's more weekend work ahead as Congress races to meet his Fourth of July deadline for passage. By a 51-49 tally and with Vice President JD Vance at the Capitol to break a potential tie, the Senate cleared a key procedural step Saturday as midnight approached. Voting had come to a standstill, dragging for more than three hours, with holdout senators huddling for negotiations and taking private meetings off the Senate floor. The Senate's top Democrat has forced a full reading of 940-page bill. That began late Saturday and has continued into Sunday morning.",

      "description": "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina says he won't seek reelection. That news Sunday comes one day after he announced his opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s tax breaks and spending cuts package because of its reductions to health care programs. Tillis said in a statement that he was proud of his career in public service but acknowledged the difficult political environment for those who buck their party and go it alone. Trump, in social media posts, had berated Tillis for being one of two Republican senators who voted on Saturday night against advancing the massive bill. Tillis would have been up for a third term in 2026.",

That's according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive intelligence.

The United States, previously a major contributor, has pulled its participation, so finding funding will be tough. The four-day Financing for Development meeting starting Monday in the southern city of Seville is taking place as many countries face escalating debt burdens, declining investments, decreasing international aid and increasing trade barriers. Co-hosts the United Nations and Spain believe the conference is an opportunity to reverse the downward spiral, close the staggering $4 trillion annual financing gap to promote development and bring millions of people out of poverty.",

Then a defense lawyer belittled the government's decision to prosecute his client, saying it was an unjust intrusion into the bedroom of Americans. The two differing views came across during closing arguments Thursday and Friday that will weigh heavily on a jury that begins deliberations on Monday. At stake is Combs' freedom after his arrest last September at a New York hotel. The 55-year-old entertainer has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges.",
