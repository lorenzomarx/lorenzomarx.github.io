And if they spend money unwisely, are they now dime wise but pound foolish? Ok, maybe those are some penny-ante concerns in the wake of the U.S. Treasury saying it will stop making shiny new penny coins after the current production run is complete. But it is the end of an era in the United States. While there will still be over a billion pennies in circulation, no new cents will be joining their ranks for the first time in more than two centuries.",

The threat delivered over social media could dramatically increase the price of iPhones, potentially hurting sales and the profits of one of America\u2019s leading technology companies.

The letter offers a spot among the elite at a campus that produces Nobel Prize winners, captains of industry and global leaders. That prestige is now in jeopardy. In its intensifying fight with the White House, Harvard was dealt its heaviest blow yet on Thursday, when the government blocked the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students. The move threatens to undermine Harvard\u2019s stature, its revenue and its appeal among top scholars around the world. Even more than the government\u2019s $2.6 billion in research cuts, the administration\u2019s action represents an existential threat for Harvard.",
