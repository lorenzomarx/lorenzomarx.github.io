      "description": "Iran and the United States are poised Friday to hold negotiations in Oman at least over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. The talks follow a chaotic week that initially saw plans for regional countries to take part in talks in Turkey. Previous rounds of meetings turned to ash following Israel\u2019s launch of a 12-day war against Iran back in June. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war. Meanwhile, nationwide protests have shaken Iran's theocracy. It responded with a bloody crackdown that killed thousands and reportedly saw tens of thousands arrested. President Donald Trump has threatened to strike the country in the time since, spurring the talks.",

In a recorded video posted Wednesday on social media, Guthrie said her family is ready to talk. But she says they want proof that Nancy Guthrie, who authorities believe was taken from her home in Arizona against her will, is still alive. Guthrie says her family heard media reports about a ransom letter. Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday night and she was reported missing midday Sunday after she didn\u2019t appear at a church. Authorities on Wednesday offered no detailed update on their search. Their next news conference is scheduled for Thursday.",

      "description": "Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv are holding a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi to end their war. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power grid and after a rise in civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging allies to pressure Moscow to end the invasion, which began in 2022. He emphasizes the need for security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks. Fighting continues alongside the talks, with Russia targeting Ukraine\u2019s electricity network. Human Rights Watch reports a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties last year. Almost 15,000 civilians have been killed since the war began.",

      "description": "The Kremlin says it regretts the expiration of the last remaining nuclear arms pact between Russia and the United States, while President Donald Trump declared he was against keeping its limits and wants a better deal. The end of the New START treaty left no caps on the two largest atomic arsenals for the first time in more than a half-century, fueling fears of an unconstrained nuclear arms race. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed readiness to stick to the pact\u2019s limits for another year if Washington agreed. But Trump indicated he wants China to be a part of a new pact \u2014 something Beijing has rebuffed. The treaty, signed in 2010, was extended in 2021 for five more years.",

The FBI called Johnson a year later. They said his mother\u2019s remains weren\u2019t in the ashes he buried. Instead, his mother was among nearly 200 decomposing bodies found inside a Colorado funeral home. The funeral home owners had given families fake ashes for years, trying to conceal the bodies. Jon and Carie Hallford were arrested in 2023 and charged with abusing nearly 200 corpses. On Friday, Jon Hallford, will be sentenced. Johnson will be among the grieving families to speak, advocating for the maximum sentence of 50 years in prison.",
