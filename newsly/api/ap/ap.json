      "description": "Israel\u2019s military warned people Thursday to evacuate the area around Iran\u2019s Arak heavy water reactor. The warning came in a social media post on X. It included a satellite image of the plant in a red circle like other warnings that proceeded strikes. The Arak heavy water reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",

      "description": "As Israeli strikes kill top Iranian generals, take out air defenses and damage nuclear sites, many wonder if President Donald Trump will deepen U.S. involvement in the conflict. Trump has long railed against what he refers to as the \u201cstupid, endless wars\u201d waged by his predecessors. That includes conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq where the U.S. helped overthrow governments. Iran's government is looking increasingly fragile, and if the U.S. does get involved, its strikes could help severely damage the country\u2019s nuclear program or even end its 4-decade-old theocracy. The recent history of U.S. attempts to remake the Middle East by force is one of costly blunders and colossal failures, and there are plenty of hard-earned lessons for anyone who wants to try it again.",

      "description": "The Supreme Court has upheld Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a stunning setback to transgender rights. The justices\u2019 6-3 decision Wednesday effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to the one in Tennessee. Chief Justice John Roberts writes for a conservative majority the law does not violate the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same. Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissent joined by her liberal colleagues that the majority \u201cabandons transgender children and their families to political whims.\u201d",
