      "description": "Warren Buffett has shocked an arena full of his shareholders by announcing that he wants to retire at the end of the year. Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board that Greg Abel should become CEO at the end of the year. Previously the 94-year-old investor has always said he had no plans to retire. But Abel has been his designated successor for years, and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses.",

      "description": "Australians are voting in Australia\u2019s general election as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his rival Peter Dutton ended campaigning along the east coast. Both Albanese and Dutton began Saturday in the electorally-crucial city of Melbourne. Albanese returned home to Sydney and Dutton to his hometown of Brisbane to vote. Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party is seeking a second three-year term. Dutton wants to become the first opposition leader to oust a first-term government since 1931, when Australians were reeling from the Great Depression. The election is taking place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis.",

      "description": "A new mission statement for the Justice Department unit that upholds voting rights shows it's being redirected toward prioritizing President Donald Trump's executive order on elections. Trump has continued to insist that widespread fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. Repeated audits, investigations and court cases show otherwise. The mission statement is silent on the voting section's normal mission of protecting the right to vote and people from being disenfranchised by gerrymandering. Instead it says the section will combat fraud and ensure that only U.S. citizens vote, even though voting by noncitizens is already illegal and has been shown to be extremely rare.",

The surface-to-surface missile has a range of about 280 miles, the Pakistani military said. Saturday's launch of the Abdali Weapon System was aimed at ensuring the \u201coperational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters,\u201d according to a statement from the military. There was no immediate comment about the launch from India, which blames Pakistan for the April 22 gun massacre that killed 26 people in the resort town of Pahalgam. Pakistan denies the charge.",

Moscow has accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of threatening the safety of dignitaries attending Victory Day celebrations after he dismissed Russia\u2019s unilateral 72-hour ceasefire. Zelenskyy instead renewed calls for a more substantial 30-day pause in hostilities, as was initially proposed by the U.S. He said the proposed ceasefire could start anytime as a meaningful step toward ending the three-year war. He said that Ukraine cannot provide security assurances to foreign officials planning to visit Russia around May 9 Victory Day, warning that Moscow could stage provocations and later attempt to blame Ukraine.",

The social media post comes as the mourning of Pope Francis continues and the papal conclave is set to begin in a few days. The image is raising eyebrows on social media, at the Vatican, from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and from Italians. Catholics are in the period of official mourning after Francis' death. Catholic cardinals are due to open the solemn conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday. The death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics",

The PAP\u2019s popular vote rose to 65.6%, up from a near-record low of 61% in 2020 polls.

The organizer of a GoFundMe page for Kavan Markwood, the 20-year-old who slipped off a railing and onto the field during the seventh inning Wednesday, said Markwood is improving. Jennifer Phillips, who is organizing the fundraiser, says Markwood has made significant progress since being admitted to the trauma center at Allegheny General Hospital in critical condition. The team's internal investigation into the incident says Markwood did not purchase any alcohol, but that one of the people who attended the game with him did legally buy a handful of alcoholic beverages.",

A field of 19 3-year-olds was set to run 1 1/4 miles for a $3.1 million prize and the garland of red roses shortly after 7 p.m. ET Saturday. Rain fell on and off throughout the day and the 60-degree (15-Celsius) temperature made it feel cool for the horses and humans. That didn\u2019t stop fans from betting, drinking, eating, smoking and shopping for souvenirs. It was the first Derby run on a sloppy track since 2019, when Country House won via disqualification.",
