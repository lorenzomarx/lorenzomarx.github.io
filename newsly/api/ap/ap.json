Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson will meet in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 they\u2019ve slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",

They include three children and their parents whose tent was bombed in Gaza City. The Israeli bombardment continued as international warnings grow over Israel's plans to control aid distribution in Gaza. Israel\u2019s blockade on the territory of over 2 million people is now in its third month. Charity kitchens are virtually the only source of food left in Gaza, but dozens have shut down in recent days as food supplies run out. Aid groups say more closures are imminent.",

Ozturk was held for more than six weeks after she was arrested while walking along a street in a Boston suburb.

To achieve that, he says President Donald Trump\u2019s team is \u201cactively looking at\u201d suspending habeas corpus, the constitutional right for people to legally challenge their detention by the government. Such a move would be aimed at migrants as part of the Republican president\u2019s broader crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Anti-Ukrainian rhetoric is now a key theme on the campaign trail, with right-wing candidates accusing Ukrainians of not being grateful enough for the help they have gotten.",

Deadly bus accidents are common in Sri Lanka, especially in the mountainous regions, often due to reckless driving and poorly maintained and narrow roads.",
