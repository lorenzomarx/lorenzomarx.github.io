      "description": "A federal judge is set to hear arguments Monday on whether to pause an immigration crackdown in Minnesota. This follows the fatal shootings of two people by government officers. The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security two weeks ago. They want to restore conditions before the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge began in December. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison plans to attend the hearing. Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit legally frivolous. The case could have implications for other states facing similar immigration enforcement operations like that underway in Minnesota.",

      "description": "The Northeastern U.S. is getting the last brunt of a massive winter storm that dumped snow, sleet and ice across much of the southern and eastern U.S. over the weekend. The colossal storm halted air and road traffic in many areas and sent temperatures plunging. As the work week began, the heaviest snow was falling from New York northward into New England. That's after heavy ice snapped branches and power lines in the South, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without electricity. In the meantime, arctic air was spreading in behind the storm and some communities in New York saw record-breaking subzero temperatures.",

The return of all remaining hostages, living or dead, has been a key part of the Gaza ceasefire\u2019s first phase, and Gvili\u2019s family had urged Israel\u2019s government not to enter the second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.",

Officials say the M/V Trisha Kerstin 3, a cargo and passenger ferry, was sailing from the port city of Zamboanga to southern Jolo island in Sulu province with 332 passengers and 27 crew members early Monday when it apparently encountered technical problems and sank. Coast guard officials said the cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but noted that the boat was cleared by the coast guard before departing and did not appear to be overcrowded.",

      "description": "Authorities say gunmen opened fire at a soccer field in central Mexico, killing at least 11 people and wounding 12 others. The attack happened Sunday at the end of a match in Salamanca. Ten people died at the scene, and another died at a hospital. A woman and a minor were among the wounded. Salamanca Mayor Cesar Prieto called the attack part of a \"crime wave\" and asked President Claudia Sheinbaum for help. The Guanajuato state prosecutor\u2019s office is investigating and coordinating with federal authorities. Guanajuato had Mexico\u2019s highest homicide total last year. Overall, Mexico\u2019s government says the country's 2025 murder rate was the lowest since 2016, although analysts have cautioned that the numbers may not fully reflect the country\u2019s violence.",

Zhang Youxia was the highest military member just below President Xi Jinping. The Defense Ministry said Saturday that authorities were investigating Zhang, the senior of the two vice chairs of the powerful Central Military Commission. Authorities also are investigating Gen. Liu Zhenli, who was in charge of the military\u2019s Joint Staff Department. The full impact of the changes for the army and China in general remains unknown. Some experts say this might have repercussion on Beijing\u2019s next move on Taiwan, the self-rule island that Beijing claims as its own territory.",
