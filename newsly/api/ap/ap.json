      "description": "Top Israeli Cabinet ministers are set to meet to vote on whether to intensify the country\u2019s military operations in the Gaza Strip, as the country's main airport was closed following a missile launched from Yemen. The army has begun to call up thousands of reserve soldiers in preparation for an expanded assault, Israeli officials said Sunday. The plans to escalate fighting in Gaza more than 18 months after the war there erupted come as a humanitarian crisis in the territory deepens. Houthi rebels on Sunday launched a missile that set off air raid sirens in many parts of the country. A large plume of smoke could be seen rising near Ben-Gurion Airport, according to footage shared by Israeli media.",

      "description": "Morocco's ports have emerged as a flashpoint in protests against the country's decision to normalize ties with Israel. A year and a half of protests have emboldened activists and exposed a gulf between the government and those they govern. Demonstrators from across the political spectrum have taken to the streets to target the country's 4-year-old decision to normalize ties with Israel. Activists accuse the government of disregarding public sentiment and are expanding their targets, which now include the country's strategic ports. Protests swelled this month ahead of the docking of vessels suspected of carrying military cargo as part of a program that includes Israel.",

In a preview aired Sunday of a state TV interview, Putin said Russia has the strength to bring the conflict to a \u201clogical conclusion.\u201d His remarks come amid competing Russian and Ukrainian ceasefire proposals and continued fighting. Ukrainian officials said 11 people, including two children, were wounded in a Russian drone strike on Kyiv overnight. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 13 Ukrainian drones.",

His use of the term continues a strategy from the 2024 presidential campaign, when he called Democratic rival Kamala Harris \u201ccomrade Kamala.\u201d But experts say there's little connection between communism, the system, and the American judges and others Trump now calls communists. Experts tell The Associated Press that Trump is using the term as a rhetorical tool to erode the legitimacy of his opponents. Trump came of age though during the Cold War, during a period of intense fear that communists could overtake the United States.",

      "description": "Democrats are looking for the right message and messengers to lead the opposition to President Donald Trump in his second term. And two vastly different politicians are emerging as top Democratic voices. They are Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York congresswoman. Both have drawn praise for high-profile speeches and events that have excited voters on the left. Pritzker is a billionaire heir who calls Trump as a threat to democracy and national stability. Ocasio-Cortez maintains her antiestablishment profile and labels Trump a corrupt billionaire who's hurting the working class he says he represents. Their messages highlight a familiar argument among Democrats' progressive and more moderate factions.",

When the conclave\u2019s cardinals finish casting their ballots in the Sistine Chapel, the 267th pope will have to decide whether to continue with Francis\u2019 policies, radically change them, or abandon them altogether. He also must choose what new projects will take precedence. Among the pressing issues are the role of women in the church, the division between traditionalists and progressives, what to do about clergy sex abuse and whether to LGBTQ+ Catholics.",

Within just four days, the S&P 500 fell about 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 4,600 points, or about 11%. This past Friday, though, the S&P 500 rallied for a ninth straight gain and pulled back to where it was on April 2. Trump's 90-day pause on many tariffs and a resilient economy helped the market bounce back.",
