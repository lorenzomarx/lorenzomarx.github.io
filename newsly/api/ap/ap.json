      "description": "Three hostages held by Hamas have been released after 471 days in captivity as part of a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. The release Sunday will be followed by that of dozens of other captives over the next several weeks under the ceasefire agreement. The truce has sparked hope and trepidation among Israelis. Many fear that the three-phase deal could collapse before all the hostages return, or that they will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is more than predicted.",

      "description": "Even before the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was fully in place, Palestinians in the war-battered Gaza Strip began to return to the remains of the homes they had evacuated during the 15-month war. They trekked through the wreckage, some on foot and others hauling their belongings on donkey carts. The return of the families comes amid looming uncertainty about whether the ceasefire deal will bring more than a temporary halt to the fighting, who will govern the enclave and how it will be rebuilt. The United Nations has said that reconstruction could take more than 350 years if Gaza remains under an Israeli blockade.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal. The resignation of Itamar Ben-Gvir does not threaten the ceasefire, but it does weaken Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition. If other far-right lawmakers leave the government \u2014 as Ben-Gvir has encouraged them to do \u2014 the prime minister could lose his parliamentary majority, potentially forcing early elections. Ben-Gvir opposed the deal because it requires Israel to free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and to withdraw troops from Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt \u2014 and because it leaves open the possibility of Hamas staying in power in Gaza.",

What\u2019s now in question is whether it will be around much longer and, if so, in what form? The Chinese social video app merged in 2017 with the competing app Musical.ly, which also launched in China. That kicked off a remarkable seven years during which TikTok grew from a niche teen app into a global trendsetter, but also emerged as a potential national security threat, according to U.S. officials.",
