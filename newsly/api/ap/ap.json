He's also reaffirming that he'll announce \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d \u2014 \u201cprobably Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201d That means the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods. Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew on Sunday from Florida to attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans.",

In the interview, Trump also said he has not seen enough action from Canada and Mexico to stave off the tariffs he has threatened to impose. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he said of the United States' two largest trading partners. \u201cSomething has to happen. It\u2019s not sustainable. And I\u2019m changing it.\u201d",

      "description": "President Donald Trump will need the Supreme Court, with three justices he appointed, to enable the most aggressive of the many actions he has taken in just the first few weeks of his second White House term. But even a conservative majority with a robust view of presidential power might balk at some of what the president wants to do. The court gave Trump major victories last year that helped clear away potential obstacles to his reelection, postponing his criminal trial in Washington, D.C., then affording immunity from prosecution for official actions. But Trump\u2019s first term was marked by significant defeats \u2014 as well as some wins \u2014 at the court.",

In a legal filing Sunday, lawyers for the men asked the court for a temporary restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that \u201cthe mere uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest injunction.\u201d An attorney for the men says that the court granted the temporary order during a brief hearing a short time later.

Russell Vought is the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought directed the CFPB in a Saturday night email to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama created it following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.",

But what\u2019s happening in Gaza and Sudan? In the Gaza Strip, much of the territory has been obliterated in an Israeli offensive after a Hamas-led attack in 2023. In the initial attack, 1,200 people were killed and 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local authorities. In Sudan, a civil war since April 2023 has killed more than 28,000 people. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll.",

The contest will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency. He and Gonz\u00e1lez are now vying for a full four-year term, promising voters to reduce the widespread criminal activity that upended their lives four years ago. The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. The runoff election is set for April 13.",
