      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska at a U.S. military base for a crucial summit. This Friday\u2019s meeting could influence the war in Ukraine and European security. Trump aims to showcase his skills as a dealmaker. For Putin, it's a chance to negotiate terms that favor Russia. The summit excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which could undermine Ukraine's interests. Trump has expressed hopes for a broader peace deal, but success is uncertain. The meeting's outcome could have significant implications for international relations and U.S. diplomacy.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting in Alaska with Vladimir Putin could be a decisive moment in the war in Ukraine and in the U.S. leader\u2019s anomalous relationship with his Russian counterpart. Trump has long boasted that he\u2019s always gotten along well with Putin and spoken admiringly of him, even praising him as \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine. But in recent months, he\u2019s expressed open frustrations with Putin and called him \u201cCRAZY\u201d while threatening to impose sanctions on Russia. Still, Trump\u2019s self-imposed deadline for sanctions came and went without any announced penalties or explanation from the White House and the Republican president, tempering expectations for their Friday summit.",

      "description": "Days before the leaders of Russia and the U.S. hold a summit meeting in Alaska, Moscow\u2019s forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of infiltrations this week in the country\u2019s industrial heartland of Donetsk. The advances amount to only a limited success for Russia, since Moscow still needs to consolidate its gains before achieving a true breakthrough. Still, some observers say it\u2019s a potentially dangerous moment. Analyst Mykola Bieleskov says Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely try to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Kyiv by arguing the 3 1/2-year-old war is going badly for Kyiv.",

      "description": "Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip 20 years ago, dismantling 21 Jewish settlements and pulling out its forces. The Friday anniversary of the start of the landmark disengagement comes as Israel is mired in a nearly two-year war with Hamas. The conflict has devastated the Palestinian territory and is likely to keep troops there long into the future. Israel\u2019s disengagement included removing four settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\u2019s controversial attempt to jump-start negotiations with the Palestinians. But it bitterly divided Israeli society and led to the empowerment of Hamas, with implications that continue to reverberate today.",

Teams of disaster management officials, police and soldiers helped by local villagers scoured the devastated Himalayan village of Chositi on Friday.

      "description": "Paleontologists have identified a new whale species from a 25-million-year-old fossil found on an Australian beach. Named Janjucetus dullardi, this creature had bulging eyes and fiendish teeth. It was an early ancestor of the baleen whale but only measured 3 meters (10 feet) in length. The fossil was discovered in 2019 on Jan Juc Beach in Victoria state. This species is only the fourth identified from the mammalodontids group, early whales from the Oligocene Epoch. Amateur fossil hunter Ross Dullard, who found the partial skull, says he will celebrate with a whale-themed party, marking the end of a six-year obsession.",
