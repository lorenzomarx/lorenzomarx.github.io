      "description": "Civilian federal jobs are being cut by the thousands, as Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency continues to shrink the government workforce at the behest of President Donald Trump. That\u2019s brought a lot of churn and uncertainty in the nation\u2019s capital, where 20% of the country\u2019s more than 2 million civilian \u2014 or nonmilitary \u2014 federal workers are located. It\u2019s also affecting workers and communities outside the Washington, D.C. area, where about 80% of that workforce is based. Those cuts mean that members of Congress are now facing potential angst among the out-of-work federal employees in their districts across the country. Some of the highest concentrations of federal workers are in places such as Oklahoma, Alaska, Alabama and New Mexico.",

      "description": "Five former secretaries of defense are calling on Congress to hold immediate hearings on President Donald Trump\u2019s recent firings of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and several other senior military leaders. That's according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. The five men represent Republican and Democratic administrations over the past three decades. They said the dismissals raised troubling questions about the administration\u2019s desire to politicize the military. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the firing of Gen. CQ Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs, saying that other presidents made changes in military personnel and that Trump deserves to pick his own team.",

      "description": "The Social Security Administration is preparing to lay off at least 7,000 people from its workforce of 60,000 \u2014 and the final reduction in force number could be as high as 50%, according to two people familiar with the agency\u2019s plans who are not authorized to speak publicly. It\u2019s unclear how the layoffs will directly impact benefits of the 72.5 million beneficiaries, including retirees and children who receive retirement and disability benefits. However, advocates and Democratic lawmakers warn that layoffs will reduce the agency\u2019s ability to serve recipients in a timely manner. The layoffs are part of the Trump administration\u2019s intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, run by Trump advisor Elon Musk.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's administration says federal agencies should begin planning to eliminate employee positions. The process is known as a reduction in force. Agency leaders must submit their plans by March 13. Trump is setting the stage for what could become a dramatic realignment of the federal government. He's already downsized the workforce by laying off probationary employees. Now the administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection. Trump foreshadowed this goal in an executive order that he signed with Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who's advising the Republican president on overhauling the government.",

It's a daunting task that may end up relying on troops self-reporting or tattling on their colleagues. A memo sent to Defense Department leaders Thursday orders the services to set up procedures to identify troops diagnosed with or being treated for gender dysphoria by March 26. They will then have 30 days to begin removing those troops from service. Transgender troops make up tiny fraction of the 2.1 million troops serving. President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth argue that their medical condition doesn\u2019t meet military standards.",

The pullout was part of the ceasefire and Israel\u2019s refusal could spark a crisis with Hamas and key mediator Egypt at a sensitive moment for the fragile truce. The official says Israeli forces needed to remain in the so-called Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, to prevent weapons smuggling. The official spoke hours after Hamas released the remains of four hostages in exchange for over 600 Palestinian prisoners, the last planned exchange of the ceasefire\u2019s first phase, which ends this weekend.",

      "description": "An investigation by Israel's military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group\u2019s intentions and underestimated its capabilities. The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack, which triggered the war in Gaza. Many Israelis believe the failures of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military and blame Netanyahu for what they view as a failed strategy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war.",
