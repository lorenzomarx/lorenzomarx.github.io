      "description": "The world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has been ordered to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East. That's according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity. It comes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers whether to take possible military action against Iran. The move, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region as Trump increases pressure on Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program.",

Emails between her and Epstein show thousands of pages of correspondence, warm exchanges and expensive presents that go beyond a standard lawyer-client relationship. Emails show she received spa treatments, luxury items, and chicken soup when she felt sick. In some instances, she advised Epstein on how he might go about trying to repair his image and defend himself publicly against new claims of misconduct. The fallout raised questions inside Goldman about her judgment and conflicts.",

Funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire Saturday as lawmakers debate new restrictions on President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda. The White House has been negotiating with the Democrats, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the deadline. Unlike the record 43-day shutdown last fall, the closures will be narrowly confined, as only agencies that are part of Homeland Security will be affected. Still some federal workers could begin to miss paychecks and services like airport screening could be affected if the shutdown drags on for weeks.",

The footage released to the public this week totals less than a minute in length. It shows not only the suspect\u2019s clothes and shoes, but also the way he moves.

Juliana Peres Magalh\u00e3es pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the February 2023 killing of Joseph Ryan. She testified that she fired the shot that killed Ryan as Brendan Banfield was fatally stabbing his wife Christine. Brendan Banfield will likely remain behind bars for life after a jury found him guilty in both killings. Prosecutors recommended her immediate release in exchange for her cooperation, but the judge rejected that deal, sentencing her to the maximum for the downgraded charge.",
