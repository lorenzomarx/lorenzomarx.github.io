      "description": "President Donald Trump is visiting Texas on Friday to assess catastrophic flooding that has killed at least 120 people. Despite his past calls to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Trump has praised the federal response to the disaster. He plans to tour affected areas by air, meet first responders and speak with victims' families. The administration has shifted focus from reducing federal disaster management to addressing the tragedy's human impact. But even though Trump hasn't been as vocal about his push to shutter FEMA, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in recent days has highlighted efforts to streamline its operations.",

      "description": "Officials say a Russian drone barrage has targeted the center of Kharkiv, injuring nine people and damaging a maternity hospital in Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Kharkiv's mayor says mothers with newborns are being evacuated to a different medical facility. He didn\u2019t say whether anyone at the hospital was among the injured. Russia\u2019s recent escalation of long-range Shahed drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, which often also include ballistic and cruise missiles as well as powerful glide bombs, has brought renewed urgency to efforts to improve Ukraine\u2019s air defenses after more than three years of war.",

Nigeria meanwhile says it\u2019s rejecting pressure to do the same. These initiatives in Africa mark an expansion in U.S. efforts to deport people to countries other than their own. It has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama but has yet to announce any major deals in Africa, Asia or Europe. While proponents see such programs as a way of deterring what they describe as unmanageable levels of migration, human rights advocates have raised concerns over sending migrants to countries where they have no ties.",

The decision Friday undoes an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution beset by legal and logistical troubles. It suggests no quick end to the long struggle by the U.S. military and successive administrations to bring to justice the man charged with planning one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States. Mohammed is accused of developing and directing the plot to crash hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.",

A senior State Department official said Friday the department is sending layoff notices to 1,107 civil servants and 246 foreign service officers with domestic assignments in the United States. While lauded by President Donald Trump's administration as overdue and necessary to make the department leaner and more efficient, the cuts have been roundly criticized by current and former diplomats who say they will weaken U.S. influence and its ability to counter existing and emerging threats abroad.",

The deal announced Friday comes just days before the scheduled start of the first trial stemming from the devastating Boeing 737 Max jetliner crash that left 157 people dead.

In a sign of continued tumult, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino were revealed to have had a contentious conversation at the White House earlier in the week over the Epstein documents and a recent story that described divisions between the FBI and Justice Department. The turmoil arising from the Epstein investigation lays bare the struggles of FBI and Justice Department leaders to resolve the conspiracy theories and amped-up expectations that they had stoked.",

Up to 5 inches of rain fell in just a few hours on Thursday, swelling waterways and isolating nearly 20 homes in Sutton. Swift-water rescue teams evacuated residents from two homes. This marks the third consecutive summer of severe flooding in the state. According to the National Weather Service, Vermont's frequent floods can be linked to climate change and its mountainous terrain. Meanwhile, Massachusetts also experienced flash flooding on Thursday, with over seven inches of rain disrupting businesses and commuters.",
