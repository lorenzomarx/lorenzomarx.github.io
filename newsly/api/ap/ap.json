      "description": "Pete Hegseth has been sworn as the nation\u2019s 29th secretary of defense. Hegseth took the oath Saturday in Washington from Vice President JD Vance less than 12 hours after a dramatic late-night vote in the Senate installed him as the Pentagon's leader. The unusually narrow confirmation came after questions from members in both parties over Hegseth\u2019s qualifications to lead the military amid allegations of heavy alcohol use and aggressive behavior toward women. Hegseth thanked Trump for his support and pledged that as defense secretary, he'll be focused on \u201cputting America first\u201d and rebuilding the U.S. military.",

Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest member of Trump\u2019s national security team. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confirmed Friday night, joining Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.",

      "description": "The Trump administration has fired more than a dozen independent inspectors general at federal agencies. The sweeping action removes oversight of his new administration and some members of Congress are suggesting the dismissals violate federal oversight laws. The dismissals began Friday night and were effective immediately. That's according to a person familiar with the actions who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public. The firings were carried out without giving Congress 30-day notices of removal of inspectors general. Even a top Republican said the move violated the law.",

The early days of Trump's second term indicate that Trump is still Trump, but he seems emboldened like never before. He\u2019s much more organized this time around. And he's betting he can fix everything. Trump doesn't have to worry about reelection. The Supreme Court has now granted presidents expansive immunity. And Trump is backed by a Republican Congress. So there's little to restrain him today.",

The order was sent Friday in a cable to U.S. embassies worldwide. The order threatened a quick halt to many of the billions of dollars in U.S.-funded projects globally to support health, education, development, job training, anti-corruption, security assistance and other efforts. The State Department will conduct a review of which of the thousands of programs can continue. Its order spells out the execution of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Monday.",

The defiance by a congressional Republican months after Trump's political comeback has stood out. But the centrist Murkowski has a history of bucking her party and Trump. She was the first GOP senator to publicly break ranks with him on the nomination of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. She disagreed with Trump\u2019s move to change the name of North America\u2019s tallest peak, which is in Alaska. And she condemned his pardon of people involved in assaulting Capitol police on Jan. 6, 2021.",

Foreign Minister Wang Yi conveyed the message in a phone call Friday, their first conversation since Marco Rubio\u2019s confirmation as secretary of state. Wang used a phrase typical of a Chinese teacher or boss warning a student or employee to behave and be responsible for their actions. The phrase seemed aimed at Rubio\u2019s vocal criticism of China and its human rights record when he was a U.S. senator, which prompted the Chinese government to put sanctions on him twice in 2020.",

It is another test for the truce that is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the militant group. The fragile deal has so far held, quieting airstrikes and rockets and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory. When the ceasefire began Sunday, three hostages held by the militants were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. On Saturday, four hostages are expected to be freed for 200 prisoners.",
