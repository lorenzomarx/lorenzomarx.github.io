Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%. The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union. An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture hours later.",

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised. The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add $5.1 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if they are allowed to continue. That's according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",

About 17,000 there were evacuated by Saturday along with 1,300 in Alberta. About 8,000 people in Saskatchewan had been relocated but leaders there warned the number could climb in the coming days.

Surveys suggested liberal Lee Jae-myung is heavily favored to win the snap election, riding on a wave of public disappointment of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle in December. The main conservative candidate, Kim Moon Soo, wants a come-from-behind victory, but observers say his failure to directly criticize Yoon have made it difficult for him to narrow the gap with Lee. The winner will be sworn in as president Wednesday without the typical two-month transition.",

They see it as a sacred refuge amid a largely secular environment at the Ivy League school in New Jersey. News that the global Catholic Church would get its first U.S.-born pope was welcomed by Catholic students at Princeton and other U.S. universities.

The findings were featured Sunday at a cancer meeting in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Experts say cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a new standard of care. Researchers followed 889 patients with treatable colon cancer who had completed chemotherapy. Half were given health information while the others worked with an exercise coach. Over time, the people in the structured exercise program had 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause.",
