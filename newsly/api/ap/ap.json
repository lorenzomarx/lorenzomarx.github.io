      "description": "The shooting of five U.S. Army soldiers at a base in Georgia is the latest in a growing list of violent incidents at American military installations over the years. Some shootings have been isolated incidents between service members. But others have been attacks on bases or mass-casualty events. A 2009 shooting at Ford Hood in Texas by an Army pyschiatrist left 13 people dead. It was the deadliest attack on a domestic military installation in U.S. history. Wednesday's shooting in Georgia occurred at Fort Stewart. Authorities said the shooter has been taken into custody. The conditions of the victims were not immediately released.",

      "description": "Trump has signed an executive order to place an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil. That brings the combined tariffs imposed by the United States on India to 50%. The tariffs would go into effect 21 days after the signing of the order Wednesday, meaning that both India and Russia might have time to negotiate with the administration on the import taxes. Trump\u2019s move could reshape India\u2019s economic ambitions. Many American companies have seen India as an alternative to the Chinese manufacturing that Trump had hoped to diminish through the use of tariffs.",

The indictment against Elias Rodriguez was unsealed Wednesday and includes nine counts, including hate crime resulting in death. It also could clear the way for the Justice Department to potentially seek the death penalty. Rodriguez is accused of killing Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim in May, reportedly shouting \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during his arrest. Prosecutors say Rodriguez planned the attack, flying from Chicago with a handgun. Witnesses described him pacing outside before opening fire. He allegedly confessed inside the museum afterward.",

Teams of army and disaster force rescuers were searching for dozens, including at least 11 Indian army soldiers, who are believed to be trapped under the rubble. Officials said at least 60 people have been rescued and moved to safer locations, but adverse weather conditions, damaged roads and rugged terrain were hampering rescue efforts. Flood waters triggered by intense rains gushed down the narrow mountains into Dharali, a mountain village, on Tuesday. It swept away homes, roads and a local market.",
