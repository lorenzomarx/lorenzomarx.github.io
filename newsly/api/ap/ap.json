      "description": "Thousands of protesters took to the street in Los Angeles on Sunday in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. The demonstrations centered on a cluster of federal buildings including a detention center where immigrants arrested on Friday were taken. As the protests swelled on Sunday, demonstrators blocked a freeway entrance, set self-driving cars on fire and threw objects including concrete and electric scooters at law enforcement officers and vehicles. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell says some of the protesters engaging in the most aggressive behavior are agitators looking to cause trouble.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is moving swiftly to act on his immigration promises with little internal restraint, determined to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to fulfill the promises of his reelection campaign. He's gone as far as ordering the California National Guard over the objections of the state's governor, the first time in 60 years that has happened. But the president is betting that Americans are on his side. He told reporters his administration had \u201cno choice\u201d because if they hadn't acted, \u201cthat place would be burning down.\u201d",

U.S. Northern Command said Monday that it's sending 700 Marines into the Los Angeles area to protect federal property and personnel.
