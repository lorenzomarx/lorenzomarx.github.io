      "description": "President Donald Trump is again banning people from countries his administration deems dangerous from coming to America. The travel ban issued Wednesday is a repeat of an order of his first administration that led to widespread confusion at airports. This version includes Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The Republican president\u2019s first travel ban was issued in 2017 and banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. After legal challenges, the order was retooled until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump has said the initial ban was aimed at protecting the country.",

U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg ruled Wednesday that the administration has to give people a way to contest their deportations under under an 18th-century wartime law. He said they must also be able to dispute allegations that they are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The ruling is the latest milestone in a monthslong legal saga over the fate of deportees imprisoned at El Salvador\u2019s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center.",
