      "description": "South Korea\u2019s new President Lee Jae-myung says he\u2019ll pursue dialogue with North Korea while bolstering a trilateral partnership with the U.S. and Japan. He said in his inaugural address after taking office Wednesday that his government will deal with potential North Korean aggressions with \u201ca strong deterrence\u201d based on the solid South Korea-U.S. military alliance. But he would also leave the door open for dialogue with North Korea and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula. He said he\u2019ll pursue pragmatic diplomacy and boost a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation based on the South Korea-U.S. alliance. Lee won a snap election Tuesday for a five-year term.",

      "description": "Members of the Boulder community are reeling from a firebombing attack that injured 12 people demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages. Residents are preparing to come together for a vigil Wednesday evening to support those impacted. Authorities say Mohamed Sabry Soliman had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday\u2019s attack in which he yelled \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d Officials say he had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in the demonstration. Soliman is an Egyptian national who has been living in the U.S. illegally. He faces federal hate crime and state attempted murder charges. Federal officials say his wife and five children have been taken into custody and could be quickly deported.",

Musk targeted Trump\u2019s top congressional priority just days after the president gave him a celebratory Oval Office sendoff marking the end of Musk\u2019s role leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk\u2019s business interests stand to lose from Trump\u2019s bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies.",

      "description": "Ukraine's Western backers are gathering to drum up more weapons and ammunition for the country's efforts to repel Russia's all-out war. But the Pentagon chief will be absent for the first time since the group organizing military aid for Ukraine was set up three years ago. Wednesday's Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at NATO headquarters is being chaired by the U.K. and Germany. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would only arrive in Brussels after it's over. His absence is the latest in a series of steps that the U.S. has taken to distance itself from Ukraine's war efforts. The U.K. said before the meeting that it plans a tenfold increase in drone production to help Ukraine.",

Witnesses say nearby Israeli troops have opened fire. Hospital officials say at least 80 people have been killed and hundreds wounded. The Israeli military has said it fired warning shots in several instances, and has also fired directly at a few \u201csuspects\u201d who ignored warnings and approached its forces. It has denied opening fire on civilians, and so far has not claimed Hamas fired in the area of the hubs, though it says it is still investigating.",

Schoof and the ministers of three remaining parties remained in power Wednesday as a caretaker Cabinet.
