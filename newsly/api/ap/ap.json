      "description": "Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out as a peculiar case. That's not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the U.S. but also for its complicated and uneasy history with its neighboring Asian giant, particularly the war history from the 20th century that overshadows politics of today. Its senior officials are visiting Washington and Beijing as Tokyo seeks a delicate balance, while its prime minister recently traveled to Vietnam and the Philippines in a rivalry with Beijing.",

      "description": "An Israeli official says Cabinet ministers have approved plans to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. The official said the plan was gradual and involved claiming more territory in the Palestinian enclave. The approval comes a day after Israel announced it was calling up tens of thousands of reservist for the expanded operations in Gaza, which Israel says are meant to increase pressure on the militant Hamas group to negotiate a ceasefire that better aligns with Israel\u2019s terms. An eight-week ceasefire with the Hamas militant group collapsed in March when Israel resumed strikes in Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians, many of them women and children.",

The rebels\u2019 media office said the United States and Israel launched at least six strikes Monday afternoon that hit the crucial Hodeida port. The rebels said other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province. On Sunday, a missile launched by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen briefly halted flights and commuter traffic at Israel\u2019s main international airport. Four people were lightly injured. It was the first time a missile struck the grounds of Israel\u2019s airport since the start of the war.",

But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, with \"bumps in the road,\" in the words of Republican Jason Smith, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. The tax cuts portion is still a work in progress, as are the reductions in Medicaid and other mainstay government programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s goal is to pass the package out of his chamber by Memorial Day. Mostly, the Republicans in Congress have made progress on spending, adding some $350 billion to the Pentagon and Homeland Security.",

      "description": "Cardinals electing a new pope have some fundamental questions to weigh, beyond whether to give the Catholic Church its first Asian or African pope. Despite hailing from 70 different countries, the 133 cardinals seem fundamentally united in finding a pope who will be able to make the 2,000-year-old church credible and relevant today, especially to young people. That's a tall task, given the sexual abuse and financials scandals that have sullied the church\u2019s reputation. Add to that the Holy See\u2019s dire financial state and often-dysfunctional bureaucracy, and the job of being pope in the 21st century seems almost impossible. As Cardinal William Seng Chye Goh of Singapore put it: \u201cWe need a superman!\u201d",

The government has claimed militancy in the region was in check and a tourism influx was a sign of normalcy returning. Those claims now lie shattered after a deadly attack on tourists killed 26 Indian Hindu men. India has described the April 22 massacre as a terror attack and blamed Pakistan for backing it. The accusation is denied by Islamabad. Security experts and former military officials say Modi\u2019s government missed warning signs. The government acknowledged that in a rare admission. The assailants are still on the run even as calls in India for military action against Pakistan are growing.",

The German War Graves Commission works to exhume and rebury the dead with dignity \u2014 regardless of the army they served. There are more than 2 million German soldiers still unaccounted for. The effort continues across former battlefields, including in Ukraine. The Volksbund sees the work as a moral obligation, even as most families are no longer actively searching for lost relatives. The ongoing recovery of the dead underscores how much remains unresolved as the world marks the 80th anniversary of the war\u2019s end.",
