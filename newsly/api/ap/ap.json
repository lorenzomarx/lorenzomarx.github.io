      "description": "World shares and U.S. futures have surged after the U.S. and China announced they were suspending for 90 days most of the sharp tariff hikes each has imposed since U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his trade war. A joint statement said the U.S. would cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from as high as 145%. China said its tariffs on U.S. goods would fall to 10% from 125%. U.S. futures gained more than 2% early Monday and shares in Asia and Europe also jumped. The agreement to talk followed two days of meetings in Geneva, Switzerland. On Friday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1% and the Dow industrials fell 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite was little changed.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s agreement with China to temporarily slash tariffs for 90 days offered the world a bit of welcome relief. But what persists is a sense of uncertainty and the possibility that the damage from the trade war could already be done. Trump declared the de-escalation of the trade war a victory, saying he would soon chat with Chinese President Xi Jinping about how to preserve the financial relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Regardless, the tariffs are now elevated from when Trump took office and the scramble to respond to the White House\u2019s mix of threats and olive branches might leave CEOs, investors and consumers unwilling to take risks.",

That's despite pushback from the country\u2019s government denying they are facing persecution. The decision to admit the 59 Afrikaners on Monday also has raised questions from refugee advocates about why they should be admitted when the Trump administration has suspended efforts to resettle people who are fleeing war and persecution and have gone through years of vetting. The white South Africans arrived at an airport just outside Washington on a private charter plane. They were then leaving on other flights to various U.S. destinations.",

In a statement, Hamas did not immediately disclose further details about the release expected on Monday. Hamas had announced on Sunday that it would free Edan Alexander as a good will gesture for the Trump administration. Alexander, an Israeli soldier, was taken captive on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli authorities earlier acknowledged Alexander's planned release, without saying when it would happen. It would be the first hostage release since Israel shattered an 8-week ceasefire with Hamas.",

Hamas released him on Monday. Alexander had been the last living American hostage in Gaza. His release came ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the region this week.

Prosecutors and the defense started summarizing their cases Monday shortly after the 12 regular jurors and six alternates were picked. Federal prosecutors will try to prove that Combs turned his hip-hop conglomerate into a racketeering enterprise that forced women to satisfy his sexual desires. Combs has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say prosecutors are wrongly trying to make a crime out of a party-loving lifestyle that may have been indulgent but was not illegal. Combs could get at least 15 years in prison if he is convicted on all charges.",

They argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are entitled to the same privacy protections as U.S. citizens and immigrants who are legally in the country. The decision comes after former acting IRS commissioner Melanie Krause resigned over the deal allowing ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",

But Trump\u2019s plan threatens to turn a global symbol of American power into an airborne collection of ethical, legal, security and counterintelligence concerns. He tried to tamp down some of the opposition by saying he would donate the plane to a future presidential library after his term ends. Democrats are united in outrage over the plan, and even some of the Republican president\u2019s allies have expressed concerns. Trump will likely face persistent questions about the plane in the coming days as he travels to the Middle East.",
