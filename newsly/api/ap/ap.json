      "description": "An American aid organization in Gaza says 20 Palestinians were killed at a distribution site in Khan Younis. The Gaza Humanitarian Fund said 19 died in a stampede, and one was fatally stabbed on Wednesday. The group accuses Hamas of spreading panic but provides no evidence. The United Nations reports 875 Palestinians have died near aid sites since May. Meanwhile, hospital officials say Israeli strikes killed 41 others, including 11 children. Israel claims its strikes target Hamas infrastructure, accusing the group of hiding among civilians. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis, with over 2 million residents struggling amid ongoing conflict and blockades.",

The latest bombardment in Russia\u2019s escalating aerial campaign against civilian areas came ahead of a Sept. 2 deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump for the Kremlin to reach a peace deal in the three-year war, under the threat of possible severe Washington sanctions if it doesn\u2019t. No date has yet been publicly set for a possible third round of direct peace talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine. Two previous rounds delivered no progress apart from prisoner swaps.",

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick interjected that the nations with goods being taxed at these rates would be in Africa and the Caribbean, places that generally do relatively modest levels of trade with the U.S. and would be relatively insignificant for addressing Trump\u2019s goals of reducing trade imbalances with the rest of the world.",

      "description": "Some dolphins in Australia use sponges on their noses to hunt fish, a skill passed down through generations. Research published Tuesday reveals that this technique involves using sponges to protect their noses while stirring up fish from the seafloor. But the sponges interfere with the dolphins' echolocation, making the skill challenging to master. Only about 5% of the studied population, or 30 dolphins, use this method. Scientists say it\u2019s an efficient but rare hunting strategy, learned over years and passed only from mother to calf. The findings highlight the complexity of dolphin behavior and appear in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
