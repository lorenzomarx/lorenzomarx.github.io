      "description": "President Donald Trump suffered a rare rebuke when the Supreme Court ruled against his tariff agenda. The decision Friday throws U.S. trade policy back into uncertainty. Trump has built his economic message around tariffs and the deals that he says they force. He argues they bring factories and jobs back. He also warns that losing them harms the economy. The White House says it is looking for other laws to keep tariffs in place. Democrats say the decision proves Trump broke the law. Polling from AP-NORC finds that most adults oppose tariffs and expect higher prices.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is dealing with a major legal defeat Friday after the Supreme Court struck down many of the tariffs he imposed last year on nearly every country on earth. The truth, though, is that Trump still has options to keep taxing imports aggressively even though the justices ruled against him. He can re-use tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression. Trump had warned an adverse ruling by the Supreme Court would leave the United States \u201cdefenseless\u2019\u2019 and possibly \u201creduced to almost Third World status.\u2019\u2019",

      "description": "A partisan battle to redraw U.S. House districts is raging in some states, even as campaigns get underway. Final boundaries for congressional voting districts remain uncertain in Missouri, New York, Utah and Virginia. And governors in Florida and Maryland are pushing lawmakers to reshape House districts ahead of this year's election. The activity comes after President Donald Trump triggered an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle by encouraging Texas to redraw its House districts for partisan advantage. California reciprocated, and a tit-for-tat redistricting clash soon spread to other states. It remains to be seen whether the changes will make any difference in which party wins control of Congress.",

The decision threatens Democrats' push for more U.S. House seats. On Thursday, a Tazewell Circuit Court judge granted a temporary restraining order sought by Republicans. The order runs until March 18 and clashes with early voting set to begin March 6, which could doom the referendum. Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones says he will appeal the ruling. Republicans say the referendum's timing and wording break the law. Democrats argue it levels the playing field ahead of the midterms.",

The Republican president is still expected to meet with governors at the White House on Friday but the event won't be facilitated by the governors' group. Trump had refused to include Democratic Jared Polis of Colorado and Wes Moore of Maryland and he recently blasted them on social media as \u201cnot worthy of being there.\u201d The episode underscores the confrontational approach Trump has taken during his second term toward state leaders he doesn't like.",
