      "description": "Kash Patel, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the FBI, is insisting to deeply skeptical Democrats that he does not have an \u201cenemies list\u201d and that the bureau under his leadership would not seek retribution against the president\u2019s adversaries or launch politically motivated investigations. The reassurances were aimed at blunting a persistent line of attack from Democrats. Throughout Thursday\u2019s hearing they confronted Patel with a vast catalog of his incendiary statements. They said those statements raise alarming questions about his loyalty to the president, including referring to some of the Jan. 6 rioters as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and calling for a purge of anti-Trump \u201cconspirators\u201d in the government and news media.",

Now that Burgum is nominated to be President Donald Trump's secretary of the Interior Department, those relationships are drawing a closer look. Many of the oil and gas companies Burgum developed a rapport with are certain to want things from him following his Senate confirmation to the post. A spokesman says the Republican routinely \"met with job creators and leaders who generated opportunities for the people of North Dakota.\u201d",

      "description": "Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, has faced tough questions from lawmakers during a fiery confirmation hearing Thursday. Democrats and Republicans alike are focusing on her past comments sympathetic to Russia, her meeting with Syria\u2019s now-deposed leader and her past support for government leaker Edward Snowden. Gabbard is a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who served two military tours in the Middle East. A Trump loyalist, she has won over some Republicans. But given thin Republican margins in the Senate, she will need almost all GOP senators to vote yes in order to win confirmation.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday used a signing ceremony for the Laken Riley Act to announce that his administration plans to send the \u201cworst criminal aliens\u201d to detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The bipartisan Laken Riley Act was the first piece of legislation that Trump has signed into law. It is named for a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who was slain last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. illegally. The law makes it easier to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes. But Trump said some of the immigrants can't be trusted to not return, necessitating their lockup at Guantanamo. He later issued a presidential memorandum on Guantanamo.",

Trump is speaking publicly far more than his predecessor, overwhelming his opponents and leaving them struggling to get a word in edgewise. Even the White House stenographers responsible for transcribing a president's remarks are racing to keep up with him. According to Factba.se, Trump spoke 81,235 words in his first week in office, up from 24,259 in the same timespan for Biden. The Republican president's admirers and critics agree that he's skilled at harnessing the country's undivided attention.",

President Donald Trump has yet to name anyone to lead the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. And for the first time since the agency was formed, there are no plans for anyone in its leadership to address the annual gathering of the nation\u2019s secretaries of state, beginning Thursday in Washington. Trump\u2019s allies remain angry over its efforts to counter misinformation about the 2020 presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Officials said it was likely to be the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the jet late Wednesday as it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. John Donnelly is the fire chief in the nation\u2019s capital. He says authorities are now switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation.",
