The ministry says the victims on the fourth floor of Nasser Hospital were killed Monday in a double-tap strike with one missile hitting first, then another moments later as rescue crews arrived. Khan Younis\u2019 Nasser Hospital has withstood raids and bombardment throughout 22 months of war, with officials at the largest medical facility in southern Gaza citing critical shortages of supplies and staff.

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he welcomes the Lebanese cabinet\u2019s \u201cmomentous decision\u201d earlier this month to work towards the disarmament of Hezbollah by the end of 2025. He said that if Lebanon takes the necessary steps to disarm Hezbollah, then Israel will respond with reciprocal measures, including a phased reduction of the Israeli military presence in southern Lebanon. Since the Israel-Hezbollah war ended in November with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, Hezbollah officials have said the group will not discuss its disarmament until Israel withdraws from five hills it controls inside Lebanon and stops almost daily airstrikes that have killed or wounded hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah members.",

      "description": "Pricey prescriptions and nagging medical costs are swamping some insurers and employers, which means patients may start paying more next year. Health insurance will grow more expensive in many corners of the market in 2026, and some coverage may shrink. That could leave patients exposed to more costs for doctor visits and prescription coverage changes. Price changes could be especially stark in individual coverage marketplaces, where insurers also are predicting the end of some government support that helps people buy coverage. Expensive gene therapies and diabetes and obesity treatments are pressuring prescription coverage.",
