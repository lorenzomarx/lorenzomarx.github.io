      "description": "Canadians are in shock after a deadly mass shooting in British Columbia. Seven people were killed at a school in Tumbler Ridge, and two others at a nearby home. Authorities say the suspected shooter, a woman, was found dead from a self-inflicted wound. More than 25 people were wounded in Tuesday's attack, with two in critical condition. Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed his condolences and announced flags will fly at half-staff for seven days. School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun control laws. The motive remains unclear as the investigation continues.",

      "description": "Investigators are still searching for Nancy Guthrie as the case reaches it's 11th day. Police briefly detained a man for questioning but released him Tuesday. Investigators say the 84-year-old mother of \u201cToday\u201d show host Savannah Guthrie was taken against her will from her home in Tucson, Arizona. The FBI released porch video of a masked person with a backpack, but they haven't identified a suspect as pressure and questions mount. Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole says it's not uncommon for investigations to move slowly. She says public tips can break cases open.",

The longtime Israeli leader is visiting the White House on Wednesday. It comes as both Tehran and Washington are projecting cautious optimism after holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday about how once again to approach negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump's approach toward Iran. Trump said Tuesday that he wants \u201cno nuclear weapons, no missiles.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office has said he wants Iran talks to include limits on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and support for militant groups like the Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah.",

Bondi is confronting a new wave of criticism stemming from the political saga that has dogged her term after the release of millions of additional Epstein disclosures that victims have slammed as sloppy and incomplete. It will be the first time the attorney general appears before Congress since a tumultuous hearing in October in which she repeatedly deflected questions and countered Democrats\u2019 criticism of her actions with her own political attacks.",

The bill, coming to a vote on Wednesday, is a Trump administration priority aimed at scrutinizing ballot access. But it faces blowback in the Senate. Called the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE America Act, the legislation requires Americans to present proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to show a valid photo identification before they cast ballots. Republicans say it's needed to prevent voter fraud. Democrats warn it will make it harder for millions of Americans to vote. Experts say voter fraud is extremely rare.",

It's very early-stage research that has been tried in only a few dozen people so far. But gene-editing approaches being developed by two companies show hints that switching off certain genes could dramatically reduce artery-clogging cholesterol. It will take far longer and larger studies to prove. Still, researchers say it raises hope of one day being able to prevent heart attacks without having to take pills.",
