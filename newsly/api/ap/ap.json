      "description": "Hamas is set to free three more Israeli hostages as well as five Thai captives, and Israel is to release another 110 Palestinian prisoners. The exchange expected Thursday would be the third since the start of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that has held for a week and a half. The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel sparked the fighting. It has held despite a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages were released.",

      "description": "A police investigator told the man who fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery that he wasn't being arrested in an interview roughly two hours after the killing. Jurors in Georgia watched video of the February 2020 police interview Wednesday as they began hearing evidence in the trial of former District Attorney Jackie Johnson. She's charged with hindering the police investigation into Arbery's death nearly five years ago. No arrests were made for more than two months. But Johnson's defense attorneys blame police for jumping to a faulty conclusion that Arbery was legally shot after committing a crime. The video showed shooter Travis McMichael's first police interview. An investigator tells him: \u201cYou're going home today.\u201d",

An official says the pause was initiated by the agency and appears not to be policy across the Defense Department. A spokesman for the DIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Trump made the announcement Wednesday right before he signed the Laken Riley Act into law as his administration\u2019s first piece of legislation. The bipartisan measure means that people who are in the United States illegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes would have to be detained and potentially deported even before a conviction.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he will use a detention center at Guantanamo Bay to hold tens of thousands of criminal immigrants in the U.S. illegally who can\u2019t be sent back to their home countries. While the U.S. naval base is best known for the suspects brought in after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it also has a separate facility used for decades to hold detained immigrants. The U.S. has leased Guantanamo from Cuba for more than a century. Cuba opposes the lease and typically rejects the nominal U.S. rent payments. Trump signed a presidential memorandum and said he'd direct federal officials to get facilities ready. Border czar Tom Homan said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would run the facility. Still, details of the plan weren\u2019t immediately clear.",
