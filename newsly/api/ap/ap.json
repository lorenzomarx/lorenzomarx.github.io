      "description": "Hope of finding survivors of the catastrophic flooding in Texas is dimming a day after the death toll surpassed 100. But crews have kept up the search for people missing in the aftermath. The search efforts benefited Tuesday from improving weather. The storms that battered the Hill Country for the past four days began to lighten up, although isolated pockets of heavy rain were still possible. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott planned to make another visit Tuesday to Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died during the flash floods. Officials said Monday that 10 campers and one counselor have still not been found.",

      "description": "Texas inspectors approved Camp Mystic\u2019s emergency plan just two days before devastating floods killed over 27 people, mostly children, at the Texas summer camp. Records released Tuesday show the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but details of the plan remain unclear. On July 4, torrential rain caused the Guadalupe River to rise rapidly, overwhelming the camp. Survivors clung to trees as cabins and tents were swept away. Despite warnings and nearby camps evacuating, Camp Mystic did not relocate its 557 campers and 100 staff. Questions remain about the camp\u2019s preparedness and response during the disaster.",

      "description": "Intense rainstorms are becoming more frequent in most of the U.S. \u2014 though experts say where they occur and whether they cause catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance. More than 100 people died in Texas Hill Country over the weekend after 12 inches of rain fell in just hours. Last year, Hurricane Helene dumped more than 30 inches of rain on western North Carolina, where flooding killed 108. Experts say human-caused climate change is setting the stage because a hotter atmosphere holds more water. But it\u2019s impossible to predict where flooding will occur in any given year.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine came after he privately expressed frustration with Pentagon officials for announcing a pause last week in the delivery of some critical weapons to Ukraine. It was a move that Trump felt wasn\u2019t properly coordinated with the White House. That's according to three people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. The Pentagon announced that it would hold back delivering to Ukraine some weapons because of what U.S. officials said were concerns that stockpiles were in short supply. Trump later effectively reversed the move. One of the people described Trump as being caught \u201cflat footed\u201d by the announcement.",

      "description": "The Israeli military says five soldiers were killed in an attack in northern Gaza, while health officials in the Palestinian territory say 18 people were killed in Israeli strikes. The bloodshed came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting the White House for talks with President Donald Trump about a ceasefire plan to pause the Gaza fighting. While there was no announcement of a breakthrough from that meeting, there were signs of progress toward a deal. The killings of the soldiers could add to the pressure on Netanyahu to strike a deal in Israel, where polls have shown widespread support for ending the war.",

That's according to two senior officials and a cable sent last week to all embassies and consulates.

The recipients of the scam messages, which were sent by text, Signal and voice mail, were not identified in the cable. A copy was shared with The Associated Press.",

Colossal Biosciences on Tuesday announced an effort to genetically engineer living birds to resemble the extinct South Island giant moa with $15 million in funding from Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh. Outside scientists say the idea of bringing back extinct species onto the modern landscape is likely impossible, although it may be feasible to tweak the genes of living animals to have similar physical traits.",

The Transportation Security Administration is looking to abandon the requirement, according to media reports.
