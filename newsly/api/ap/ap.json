      "description": "Pope Francis has died. He was history\u2019s first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change. He was 88. The Vatican camerlengo made the announcement Monday. Francis suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man. He was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there. From his first greeting as pope of a simple \u201cGood evening\u201d to his embrace of refugees and the downtrodden, Francis signaled a very different tone for the papacy, stressing humility over hubris for a Catholic Church beset by scandal and accusations of indifference.",

He was ordained a Jesuit priest in 1969 and led the order in Argentina during the country\u2019s murderous dictatorship that began in the 1970s. After being named archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was elevated to cardinal in 2001 by St. John Paul II. He was elected the 266th pope on March 13, 2013, on the fifth ballot.",

      "description": "Pope Francis changed the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching in areas such as the death penalty and nuclear weapons. But he upheld it in other areas, such as abortion and celibacy for priests. Francis defended the church\u2019s opposition to artificial contraception, but he also said Catholics should instead practice \u201cresponsible parenthood\u201d through approved methods. And he suggested that women threatened with the Zika virus could use artificial contraception. He divided the church by issuing an opening to divorced and civilly married Catholics to receive Communion.",

The deaths mark the latest in America\u2019s intensified campaign of strikes targeting the rebels. The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command declined to answer questions about the strike or discuss civilian casualties from its campaign. The Houthis described the strike as hitting the Farwa neighborhood market in Sanaa\u2019s Shuub district. That area has been targeted before by the Americans.

That person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the unclassified chat included 13 people. The White House late Sunday dismissed the report as a \u201cnon-story,\u201d insisting that no classified information was shared.",

Governments including those of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have begun negotiations with Washington after President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against most of America\u2019s trading partners on April 2. The import taxes were mostly paused after markets panicked, but he increased his already steep tariffs against China. The Commerce Ministry said Monday that China \u201cfirmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China\u2019s interests\u201d and China would retaliate if that happened. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier the countries currently negotiating trade deals with the U.S. should \u201capproach China as a group\u201d together with Washington.",
