      "description": "Cardinals are meeting at the Vatican to make the first decisions about running the Catholic Church following the death of Pope Francis. They need to decide when Francis' body will be moved into St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing, when the funeral and burial will take place, and when the conclave will begin to elect his successor. The Congregation of Cardinals, the Tuesday gathering of the cardinals currently in Rome, could choose to begin the public viewing as soon as Wednesday. Under norms approved by Francis last year, the funeral and burial must occur between Friday and Sunday.",

      "description": "Pope Benedict XVI stunned the world when he announced his resignation in 2013, the first in 600 years. That led some to wonder, as he grew increasingly frail and sick, if Pope Francis would follow in his predecessor's footsteps. While Francis kept open the possibility, and even had a resignation letter prepared, he said more recently that he believed that the papacy was for life and pointed out the risks that papal resignations might become a \u201cfashion\u201d or the norm.",

But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. President Donald Trump placed a 145% import tax on China, which countered with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures.",

The court seemed likely Tuesday to find the Montgomery County school system could not require elementary school children to sit through lessons involving the books if parents expressed religious objections to them. The court has repeatedly endorsed claims of religious discrimination in recent years. The school board introduced the storybooks in an effort to better reflect the district\u2019s diversity. Parents sued after the school system stopped allowing them to pull their kids from lessons that included the books.",
