      "description": "Disastrous flash floods from a raging central Texas river have killed at least 51 people, a total that may increase. Officials say the death toll is 43 in the hardest-hit area of Kerr County. Authorities say 15 of the victims are children and 27 girls attending a summer camp are still missing. Gov. Greg Abbott promised that crews would work around the clock to rescue and recover victims as rescuers maneuver through broken trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris. Abbott also issued a proclamation declaring Sunday as a day of prayer across the state. Pope Leo XIV, history's first American pontiff, offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster.",

They include a 68-year-old camp director, an Alabama elementary student away for the summer and a grandparent who had been reported missing while on her way to work. The flooding in central Texas originated from the fast-moving waters on the Guadalupe River on Friday, killing nearly 70 people, including 21 children. Authorities say search and rescue efforts are still underway for children at a summer camp attended by hundreds of girls.",

      "description": "Flash floods in Texas have killed nearly 70 people, many of them children. An unknown number of people are missing. Heavy rains fell quickly in the predawn hours Friday in the Texas Hill Country, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Among the missing are 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp. Officials are resisting estimating the total number of missing. The July Fourth holiday weekend likely brought an influx of visitors to the area outside San Antonio, making it difficult to track all the people who may have been in the area.",

      "description": "The United States is stepping up pressure on trading partners to quickly make new deals before a Wednesday deadline when a tariff pause by President Donald Trump expires. There are plans for the U.S. to start sending letters Monday warning countries that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1. That furthers the uncertainty for businesses, consumers and America's trading partners. And questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether Trump will once more push off imposing the rates. Trump could extend the time for dealmaking, as he has done before.",

No one has claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas, which include gunfire, rocket-propelled grenades and potentially drone boats being used. However, the scale of the attack led to the suspicion that Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels carried it out.

U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Netanyahu on Monday. The document shared with The Associated Press outlines plans for a 60-day ceasefire. During that time, Hamas would hand over 10 living and 18 dead hostages, Israeli forces would withdraw to a buffer zone along Gaza\u2019s borders with Israel and Egypt, and significant amounts of aid would be brought in.

      "description": "Donald Trump has made tax cuts a central part of his political legacy. There were his first-term cuts. And now the Republican has pushed through an extension of those cuts and added new tax breaks. But the bill he signed into law Friday also comes with significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, contradicting promises to protect such programs. Democrats plan to make that expected fallout a campaign focus, while Republicans argue the bill will boost the economy. Historically, major legislation that's been backed mostly by just one party has rarely translated into political rewards. So the long-term effects of Trump\u2019s tax policy are unclear.",
