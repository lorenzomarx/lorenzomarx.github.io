      "description": "U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen\u2019s capital killed 12 people and wounded 30 others, the Houthi rebels said early Monday. The deaths mark the latest in America\u2019s intensified campaign of strikes targeting the rebels. The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command declined to answer questions about the strike or discuss civilian casualties from its campaign. The Houthis described the strike as hitting the Farwa neighborhood market in Sanaa\u2019s Shuub district. That area has been targeted before by the Americans. Strikes overnight into Monday also hit other areas of the country.",

Israel at first claimed that the medics\u2019 vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked. Cellphone video recovered from one of the medics contradicted Israel\u2019s initial account. The military investigation said Sunday that the deputy battalion commander, \u201cdue to poor night visibility,\u201d assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants.",
