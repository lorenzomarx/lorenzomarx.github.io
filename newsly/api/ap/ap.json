      "description": "A judge is expected to order Bryan Kohberger to serve four life sentences without parole this week for brutally stabbing four University of Idaho students to death nearly three years ago. Wednesday\u2019s sentencing hearing will be an opportunity for the families of Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Kaylee Goncalves to tell the court and Kohberger about the anguish they\u2019ve felt since he broke into a home and killed their loved ones in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022. Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary in a deal that avoids the death penalty. He waived his right to appeal.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump is unveiling an \u201cAI Action Plan,\" shaped by Silicon Valley tech leaders who supported his campaign. The plan being released Wednesday is expected to focus on boosting artificial intelligence technology exports, streamlining permits for energy-intensive data centers, and countering perceived liberal bias in AI systems, dubbed \u201cwoke AI.\u201d Opponents of the Trump administration's AI agenda argue it prioritizes the needs of Big Tech over people. Nearly 100 groups have come together to sign a resolution calling for a \u201cPeople's AI Action Plan\u201d that would preserve safeguards for the American public.",

Thousands of people gathered in the capital and other cities across Ukraine on Tuesday to urge President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to veto a controversial bill passed by Ukraine\u2019s Parliament. After Zelenskyy approved it, activists called on social media for another demonstration Wednesday in the center of Kyiv. Critics, including EU officials and rights groups, say the law undermines the agencies' independence and threatens Ukraine's democratic reforms.

But Connor Blades lifted a rock in a tiny forest in Barbados and held his breath one sunny morning. The project officer with the eastern Caribbean island's environment ministry had already spent more than a year looking for the snake. The species can fit comfortably on a coin. The specimen in front of him was too tiny to identify with the naked eye. So he analyzed it several hours later in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies. And it was a Barbados threadsnake.",

Parkinson\u2019s is a neurologic disease that robs people of control over their movements. It typically starts with tremors and is characterized by slow movement, a shuffling gait, stiff limbs, balance problems and slurred speech. About 10 million people worldwide are living with the disease, which usually appears after age 60. While Parkinson\u2019s itself isn\u2019t considered fatal, people can die from complications of the disease, including lung problems as muscle weakness impedes the ability to cough and to swallow.",
