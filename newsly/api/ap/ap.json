      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s removal of national security adviser Mike Waltz brings further disruption to his national security team. It's a team that's already endured scrutiny over top officials\u2019 use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations. There also have been mounting questions over the leadership of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and about the firing of the four-star general who led the National Security Agency. But Waltz's ouster also enables Trump to consolidate foreign policy matters in just a few hands, with the president asserting even more White House power over the decision-making process and relying on people who've entirely embraced his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",

      "description": "A new mission statement for the Justice Department unit that upholds voting rights shows it's being redirected toward prioritizing President Donald Trump's executive order on elections. Trump has continued to insist that widespread fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. Repeated audits, investigations and court cases show otherwise. The mission statement is silent on the voting section's normal mission of protecting the right to vote and people from being disenfranchised by gerrymandering. Instead it says the section will combat fraud and ensure that only U.S. citizens vote, even though voting by noncitizens is already illegal and has been shown to be extremely rare.",

Shortage of food and supplies has driven the territory toward starvation. Supplies to treat and pervent malnutrition are depeleted and quickly running out as documented cases of malnutrition rise. Some 3,600 children were admitted and treated for acute malnutrition in the past month_ a figure that is likely rising. Parents are running out of options of what to feed their children and where to take fhem to get help. Images of emaciated children are becoming more frequent and hungry children at community kitchens are fighting for food, alongside adults.",

The surface-to-surface missile has a range of about 280 miles, the Pakistani military said. Saturday's launch of the Abdali Weapon System was aimed at ensuring the \u201coperational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters,\u201d according to a statement from the military. There was no immediate comment about the launch from India, which blames Pakistan for the April 22 gun massacre that killed 26 people in the resort town of Pahalgam. Pakistan denies the charge.",

Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party is seeking a second three-year term. Dutton wants to become the first opposition leader to oust a first-term government since 1931, when Australians were reeling from the Great Depression.

Moscow has accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of threatening the safety of dignitaries attending Victory Day celebrations after he dismissed Russia\u2019s unilateral 72-hour ceasefire. Zelenskyy instead renewed calls for a more substantial 30-day pause in hostilities, as was initially proposed by the U.S. He said the proposed ceasefire could start anytime as a meaningful step toward ending the three-year war. He said that Ukraine cannot provide security assurances to foreign officials planning to visit Russia around May 9 Victory Day, warning that Moscow could stage provocations and later attempt to blame Ukraine.",

The social media post comes as the mourning of Pope Francis continues and the papal conclave is set to begin in a few days. The image is raising eyebrows on social media, at the Vatican, from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and from Italians. Catholics are in the period of official mourning after Francis' death. Catholic cardinals are due to open the solemn conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday. The death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics",

It was an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community but no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed. It's an example of research being lost at time when understanding vaccine hesitancy is especially urgent. Flu killed a near-record 216 children this year and vaccine-preventable measles and whooping cough are soaring.",
