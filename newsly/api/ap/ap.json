      "description": "A federal judge says he's found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg said Wedneday that the administration must try to \u201cpurge\u201d itself of a contempt finding or he'll launch hearings and potentially refer the matter for prosecution. The move by Boasberg marks an escalation in a battle between the judicial and executives branches of government over a president\u2019s powers to carry out key White House priorities.",

Chris Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador Wednesday to push for the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was sent there by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation. Van Hollen said in a video that he hopes to meet with Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who was living in Maryland. He said he also hopes to meet with high level officials to press for his return to the United States. The Trump administration and Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, said this week that they have no basis to send him back.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's joining some of his top economic advisers for negotiations at the White House over tariffs and trade with a top Japanese official who's traveling to Washington for the talks. The Republican president says in a post on his social media platform he'll attend the meeting Wednesday alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Trump recently announced a round of global tariffs but then quickly put them on hold for 90 days after the markets tanked. Japan's 24% across-the-board tariff is on hold. But a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. remain in place.",

Israeli forces have taken over large areas of Gaza in recent weeks in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law.",
