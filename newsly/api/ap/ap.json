      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for talks at the White House on Friday. The U.S. leader is signaling he\u2019s not ready to agree to sell Kyiv a long-range missile system that the Ukrainians say they desperately need. The meeting comes a day after Trump had a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In recent days, Trump had shown openness to selling Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, even as Putin warned against it. Following Thursday\u2019s call with Putin, Trump appeared to downplay the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles.",

      "description": "Two U.S. officials have confirmed to The Associated Press that the U.S. military has carried out a sixth deadly strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean.

The former Trump administration national security adviser is accused of storing top secret records at home and sharing with relatives diary-like notes that contained classified information. Bolton's lawyer says Bolton \"did not unlawfully share or store any information.\u201d Bolton is expected to appear later Friday in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland. It's the third case to be filed against a Trump adversary in the past month.

The world's largest maritime nations had been discussing ways to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump urged countries to vote against the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday. The proposed regulations would have set a marine fuel standard and imposed fees for emissions above allowable limits. Shipping emissions have grown to about 3% of the global total, prompting calls for action.",
