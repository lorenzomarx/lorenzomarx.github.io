      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 2026 budget plan would slash non-defense domestic spending by $163 billion, while increasing expenditures on national security. That's according to statements released by the White House on Friday. The budget showed a desire to crack down on diversity programs and initiatives to address climate change. But the administration has yet to release detailed tables on what it wants income taxes, tariffs or the budget deficit to be. This budget is engineered by Trump budget director Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025. It comes as Congress is already deep into drafting the Republican president's big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered money for deportations and border security.",

      "description": "Israel has blocked aid from entering Gaza for two months and says it won\u2019t allow food, fuel, water or medicine into the besieged territory until it can prevent Hamas and other militants from siphoning it away from Palestinian civilians. But officials from the U.N. and aid groups say proposals Israel has floated to use its military to distribute vital supplies are untenable. They are problematic, these officials say, because they allow military and political objectives to impede humanitarian goals, put restrictions on who is eligible to give and receive aid, and could force large numbers of Palestinians to move \u2014 which would violate international law.",

The archbishop of Westminster is participating in his first conclave, and says these are days of ''attentive listening,\" as cardinals get to know one another and identify what the Catholic Church needs in a new leader. His predecessor as archbishop of Westminster was a key behind-the-scenes player in the 2013 conclave that elected an Argentine Jesuit pope.",

Both Albanese and Dutton began Saturday in the electorally-crucial city of Melbourne. Albanese returned home to Sydney and Dutton to his hometown of Brisbane to vote. Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party is seeking a second three-year term. Dutton wants to become the first opposition leader to oust a first-term government since 1931, when Australians were reeling from the Great Depression.

Vance took a five-day trip to Europe, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland and toured Italy and India. The vice president is usually accompanied by his wife, Usha, and their three children, and he routinely mixes business with cultural excursions, pairing sometimes prickly official remarks with lighter events. Experts say such trips aren't unusual. His quick shifts between work and leisure may be emblematic of his generation.",

President Gabriel Boric has promised to urgently address a bill that seeks to legalize euthanasia and assisted dying. It is a crucial period for Boric\u2019s social agenda ahead of the November presidential election. In 2021, the euthanasia bill passed in the Chamber of Deputies but has since been stalled in the Senate. Over the years, several terminally ill people have made anguished public appeals in hopes of securing the right to have what they describe as dignified deaths.",
