U.S.-led ceasefire efforts appear to be gaining momentum after nearly 21 months of war as Israel's prime minister visits the White House on Monday. Weary Palestinians expressed cautious hope Saturday after Hamas gave a \u201cpositive\u201d response to the latest U.S. proposal for a 60-day truce. But the militant group said further talks are needed on implementation. Two American aid workers with the Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were injured in southern Gaza in an attack at a food distribution site.",

      "description": "Donald Trump has made tax cuts a central part of his political legacy. There were his first-term cuts. And now the Republican has pushed through an extension of those cuts and added new tax breaks. But the bill he signed into law Friday also comes with significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, contradicting promises to protect such programs. Democrats plan to make that expected fallout a campaign focus, while Republicans argue the bill will boost the economy. Historically, major legislation that's been backed mostly by just one party has rarely translated into political rewards. So the long-term effects of Trump\u2019s tax policy are unclear.",
