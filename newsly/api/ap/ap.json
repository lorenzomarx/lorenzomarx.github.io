      "description": "Pope Leo XIV will celebrate his first Mass after his historic election as the first North American pope. He will meet on Friday with the cardinals who chose him to lead the Catholic Church and follow in Pope Francis\u2019 reform-minded footsteps. Leo, the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost, surprised the world on Thursday when he emerged on the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, since there had long been a taboo against a pope from the United States. He spoke to the crowd in Italian and Spanish, but not English, and honored Pope Francis for his final salute to the crowd on Easter Sunday.",

      "description": "When white smoke poured out of the Sistine Chapel revealing that a new pope had been chosen, John Prevost turned on his television in Illinois and watched in awe as his brother\u2019s name was announced. He said Thursday that he was in \u201cdisbelief\u201d and then felt an incredible sense of pride that his brother, Cardinal Robert Prevost, had become the 267th pontiff to lead the Catholic Church, taking the name Leo XIV. That makes the Chicago-born missionary the first U.S. pope. John Prevost described his brother as being very concerned for the poor and those who don\u2019t have a voice. He said he expects him to be a \u201csecond Pope Francis.\u201d",

In Pakistan, an unusually intense night of artillery exchanges left at least four civilians dead and wounded 12 others in areas near the Line of Control that divides Kashmir, local police official Adeel Ahmad said. In India, military officials said Pakistani troops barraged their posts overnight with artillery, mortars and gunfire at multiple locations. A woman was killed and two other civilians were injured in Uri sector, police said.",

Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since Trump sparked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their counterparts in Geneva in the most-senior known conversations between the two countries in months. It comes amid growing U.S. market worry over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods.",

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds 56% of Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s approach on higher education, while about 4 in 10 approve, in line with his overall job approval. Trump has tried to force change at universities he says have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism. The poll shows a disconnect between Trump\u2019s targeting of universities and an American public that sees them as key to scientific research, new ideas and innovative technology.",

Cases are climbing not only in Mexico, but in the U.S. and Canada. Mexico's cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community in the northern border state of Chihuahua. It's a community long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities. Officials say results of the campaign alongside Mennonite leaders are mixed. They cite tens of thousands of vaccinations in Chihuahua. But infections have ballooned, spreading past the community to Indigenous and other populations. Vaccination teams say door-to-door efforts are helping, even if not everyone is open to the shot. Some ask questions and follow up later. Others won't even open the door.",

Data released Friday showed China's total exports rose 8% last month from a year earlier, much faster than most economists had been expecting. Exports to the U.S. sank 21% as President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese exports rose to as high as 145%. But China's total exports remained resilient, with exports to Latin America, India and Southeast Asia expanding at a double-digit pace in the first four months of the year.
