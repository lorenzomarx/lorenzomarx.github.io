      "description": "Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv are holding a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi to end their war. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power grid and after a rise in civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging allies to pressure Moscow to end the invasion, which began in 2022. He emphasizes the need for security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks. Fighting continues alongside the talks, with Russia targeting Ukraine\u2019s electricity network. Human Rights Watch reports a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties last year. Almost 15,000 civilians have been killed since the war began.",

      "description": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has apologized to victims of Jeffrey Epstein for appointing Peter Mandelson as the U.K.'s ambassador to Washington. On Thursday, he expressed regret for believing Mandelson's lies and appointing him. Starmer fired Mandelson in September after emails showed Mandelson maintained a friendship with Epstein following the financier\u2019s 2008 conviction for sex offenses involving a minor. The prime minister now faces fresh pressure over the appointment after newly released documents revealed more details of Mandelson\u2019s close relationship with Epstein. British police are investigating Mandelson over potential misconduct in public office. He is not accused of any sexual offenses.",

All of these things appeared in the mountain of documents released publicly by the U.S. Justice Department as part of its effort to comply with a law requiring it to open its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information. Lawyers for some of the accusers have called on the Justice Department to temporarily take down the information. The Justice Department says it is taking down all inadvertently disclosed private information it\u2019s been made aware of.",

Guthrie says her family heard media reports about a ransom letter. Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday night and she was reported missing midday Sunday after she didn\u2019t appear at a church.

U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai issued the preliminary injunction Wednesday. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by a nonprofit law firm representing a man who was detained by immigration officers without a warrant despite having a valid work permit. In a memo last week, the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement emphasized that agents should not make arrests without an administrative arrest warrant issued by a supervisor unless they develop probable cause to believe the person is likely to escape from the scene.",

Both sides accuse the other of violations, even as they continue to push ahead with the fragile process. At least 556 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since the U.S.-brokered truce came into effect, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza in the same period, with more injured, including a soldier who was severely wounded overnight. Little progress has been made on larger issues concerning Gaza's future.",

Andr\u00e9s Vel\u00e1squez, a former governor, is among those speaking out after years of self-imposed silence. He recently appeared in videos supporting Maduro's removal and calling for the release of political prisoners. He likened the shift to glasnost, with media outlets reopening to critical voices. However, concerns remain about the true extent of political liberalization, as the repressive state apparatus is still in place. The future of Venezuela's democratic transition remains uncertain.",

The cases of four defendants recently sent from Mexico to the U.S. for prosecution provide a glimpse into shadowy money laundering networks that keep the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and other violent groups in business pumping drugs into American communities. Indictments have been filed in Kentucky\u2019s federal court. The prosecutions underscore the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to turn up the pressure on cartels and stay ahead of their evolving and sophisticated tactics to launder massive drug proceeds across the border without detection.",
