      "description": "Mike Waltz will face questioning from lawmakers for the first time since he was ousted as national security adviser. President Donald Trump has nominated him to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and he's set to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing Tuesday. It will provide senators with the first opportunity to grill Waltz over revelations that he added a journalist to a private text chain on the unclassified Signal messaging app that was used to discuss sensitive military plans. Waltz took responsibility for the episode. He faces lawmakers after months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous U.N. nominee.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump and Sen. David McCormick of Pennsylvania plan to announce $70 billion of energy investments at a new summit focusing on energy and innovation. The Republican president has repeatedly pledged U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market. Pennsylvania is a swing state critical to Trump's wins in 2016 and 2024, and is at the forefront of his energy agenda. Coal is a key part of that and is a big industry in the state. McCormick says Tuesday's summit is meant to bring together top energy companies and artificial intelligence leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump\u2019s energy policies. Participating companies include Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil.",

      "description": "Inflation rose last month to its highest level in four months as the cost of gas, food, and groceries rose, reversing several months of cooling price pressures. The Labor Department said that consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month. Worsening inflation poses a political challenge for President Donald Trump, who promised during last year\u2019s presidential campaign to immediately lower costs.",

The negotiations signal potential difficulties ahead of an important test vote.

Prosecutors called it a \u201cmoronic mission.\u201d The 39-year-old Daniel Graham and 32-year-old Adam Carruthers were convicted of criminal damage for destroying the tree and harming the ancient wall. The tree was famous for its scenic location and a cameo in the 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\u201d It was a beloved landmark. Justice Christina Lambert handed down the sentences at Newcastle Crown Court on Tuesday.",

Last week, the Justice Department and the FBI abruptly walked back the notion there's an Epstein client list of elites who participated in the wealthy New York financier\u2019s trafficking of underage girls.
