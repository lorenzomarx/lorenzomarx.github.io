      "description": "Los Angeles police have swiftly enforced a downtown curfew, making arrests moments after it took effect, deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Hours later after the curfew went into effect Tuesday night, many of the protesters had dispersed, although small sporadic confrontations continued. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier accused Trump of drawing a \u201cmilitary dragnet\u201d across the nation\u2019s second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard. He also deployed Marines, though none were seen on the streets Tuesday. Trump ordered the deployment of nearly 5,000 troops, including National Guard and Marines, to LA.",

      "description": "U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver has been indicted on federal charges alleging she \u201cforcibly impeded\" immigration officers during a skirmish outside a New Jersey detention center. McIver has disputed the allegations as baseless. The skirmish happened last month as Newark\u2019s mayor was arrested after trying to join McIver and two fellow Democratic representatives who said they went to conduct congressional oversight at Delaney Hall, where other people were protesting outside. Police bodycam video shows McIver\u2019s elbows pushing into an officer, but it isn\u2019t clear from the video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene.",

      "description": "The upcoming parade in Washington to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary has divided veterans. Critics say it's a thinly veiled celebration of President Donald Trump's 79th birthday when the Republican is making cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs and banning transgender troops. Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime celebration of the Army\u2019s achievements and the service of millions of soldiers over centuries. Saturday's parade will feature hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers. The Army expects as many as 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.",

Austria is mourning the victims of what appears to be the deadliest attack in its post-World War II history, and a national minute of silence is planned for Wednesday morning. But questions remain about the motive of the shooter. A senior official said the farewell letter, in which the assailant said goodbye to his parents, hadn't allowed investigators to draw conclusions.",

Jennifer Lyell, a onetime denominational publishing executive who went public in 2019 with allegations that she had been sexually abused by a seminary professor while a student, died Saturday at 47. Friends reported that the backlash Lyell received after going public took a devastating toll on her.
