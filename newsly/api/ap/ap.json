      "description": "The House is heading towards a final vote on a bill to require the detainment of unauthorized migrants accused of theft and violent crimes. It marks the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration. The Laken Riley Act is named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man. Its passage would show just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump\u2019s election victory.",

      "description": "The Pentagon says it has begun deploying 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the southern border. It puts in motion plans President Donald Trump laid out in executive orders shortly after he took office to crack down on immigration. Acting Defense Secretary Robert Salesses says the troops will fly helicopters to assist Border Patrol agents and help in the construction of barriers. The Pentagon also will provide military aircraft to support Department of Homeland Security deportation flights for more than 5,000 detained migrants. The active duty forces will join the roughly 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces already there.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump began his second administration with a blitz of policy actions to reorient U.S. government priorities. He has covered issues from trade, immigration and U.S. foreign aid to demographic diversity, civil rights and the hiring of federal workers. Some have an immediate policy impact. Others are more symbolic. Some already are being challenged by federal lawsuits. In total, the Republican president\u2019s sweeping actions reflect many of his campaign promises and determination to concentrate executive branch power in the West Wing, while moving the country sharply rightward.",

Trump in a Fox News interview on Wednesday repeated false claims that California\u2019s fish conservation efforts in the northern part of the state are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas. He says the blame for Los Angeles\u2019 struggles to tame some of the deadly fires lies with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Trump added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should give California anything until they let the water run down.\" Newsom for his part has called for partnership amid the disaster.",

Trump called Budde a \u201cRadical Left hard line Trump hater\u201d on his Truth Social site on Wednesday",

The Hughes Fire broke out late Wednesday morning. It quickly burned through more than 15 square miles of trees and brush. The flames sent up a huge plume of dark smoke near the Lake Castaic area. The fire comes as parched Southern California could get some badly needed rain this weekend. But even a small amount of precipitation could create new challenges like toxic ash runoff. Meanwhile, red flag warnings for critical fire danger are in effect through Thursday.",

Nearly three-quarters of the EU\u2019s electricity doesn\u2019t emit planet-warming gases into the air \u2014 with another 24% of electricity in the bloc coming from nuclear power, a report released by the climate energy think tank Ember found.
