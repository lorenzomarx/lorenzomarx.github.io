      "description": "Israeli warplanes pounded Iran\u2019s capital overnight, hitting a facility used to make uranium centrifuges and another that made missile components, the Israeli military said. It said it had intercepted 10 missiles, as Iran\u2019s retaliatory barrages have diminished since the start of the conflict. Israel has carried out blistering attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and military sites since launching its surprise bombardment on Friday. A Washington-based Iranian human rights group said at least 585 people, including 239 civilians, have been killed and more than 1,300 wounded. Iran has fired some 400 missiles and hundreds of drones in retaliatory strikes that have killed at least 24 people in Israel and wounded hundreds.",

      "description": "In Iran\u2019s capital city, the streets are empty, businesses closed, communications patchy at best. Panicked masses spend restless nights on the floors of metro stations as strikes boom overhead. The country is just under a week into a fierce Israeli blitz to destroy the country\u2019s nuclear program and its military capabilities. Thousands have fled Tehran, spending hours in gridlock as they head toward the suburbs, the Caspian Sea, or even Armenia or Turkey. But others are stuck in high-rise apartment buildings. They worry and so do their relatives elsewhere.",

      "description": "Officials say a Russian missile and drone bombardment has killed at least 15 people and injured 156 others in Ukraine overnight, with the main barrage demolishing a nine-story apartment building in Kyiv. It was the deadliest attack on the Ukrainian capital this year and came as two rounds of direct peace talks have failed to make progress on ending the war, now in its fourth year. The city's military administration says 14 people were killed and 138 others were injured in the capital as explosions echoed for hours. Russia has repeatedly hit civilian areas of Ukraine with missiles and drones, and the United Nations says the attacks have killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians.",

It's a development roiling the global aid community, which says the contractors are operating with little transparency or humanitarian experience. Crucially, says Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Rescue Committee nonprofit, the U.S. aid contractors are working with governments that are combatants in the conflicts, in ways Egeland says risk weaponizing aid. In Gaza, an American-led operation is distributing aid under an Israeli plan to replace the U.N.-led aid system there. In South Sudan, Michael Mulroy, a former U.S. defense and intelligence official, says his team brings experience to aid drops funded by South Sudan.",

Human rights groups have documented the deaths of over 60 people as a result of the dissolution of a federal agency, known as DADSE, that had covered their high-cost medication. That overhaul represents just one facet of how Milei\u2019s cutbacks have torn at an extensive public health system that once set this country apart from the rest of Latin America. According to experts, government workers and advocates, the cutbacks have overwhelmed the nation\u2019s vaunted, if creaking, public hospitals, upended vaccination efforts and taken a brutal toll on the country\u2019s poor and unemployed.",
