      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to create \u2018impression of a ceasefire\u2019, saying Russian forces continued attacks despite President Vladimir Putin\u2019s unilateral declaration of an Easter ceasefire. Zelenskyy reported on Sunday 59 shelling incidents, five assaults, and multiple drone strikes. He reiterated Ukraine\u2019s offer to extend the truce for 30 days but stressed his country would respond based on real battlefield conditions. Meanwhile, Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson say Ukraine has also violated the truce. Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored.",

      "description": "Dozens of Ukrainians have gathered at a bombed-out church in the country\u2019s north to celebrate Easter Sunday, doubting a ceasefire with Russia is possible. Russian President Vladimir Putin unilaterally announced a temporary Easter truce from Saturday evening to midnight following Easter Sunday, citing humanitarian reasons. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday night that Russian strikes continued. In the village of Lukashivka, the faithful marked the day in the courtyard of a destroyed church, symbolizing resilience. Priests and parishioners voiced doubt that a truce can be reached as efforts by the United States and others to broker a broader ceasefire have yet to yield results.",

      "description": "The Vatican is celebrating Easter without Pope Francis presiding. The 88-year-old pontiff continues his recovery from a near-fatal bout of double pneumonia. In his place, Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the retired archpriest of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, celebrated the open-air Mass before thousands of people in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Francis has only appeared in public a handful of times since returning to the Vatican on March 23 after a 38-day hospital stay. He skipped the solemn services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday leading up to Easter. But he was expected to make an appearance on Sunday, according to the Mass booklet and liturgical plans released by the Vatican.",

Vance\u2019s motorcade entered Vatican City through a side gate and parked near Francis\u2019 hotel residence while Easter Mass was being celebrated in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Francis, who has greatly cut back his workload to recover, delegated the celebration of the Mass to another cardinal. Vance and the pope have tangled sharply over migration and the Trump administration\u2019s plans to deport migrants en masse. Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy. Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the Vatican secretary of state and foreign minister on Saturday.",

But President Donald Trump's new tariffs will make it many times more expensive. The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association estimates that 90% of the core products used to care for babies are made in Asia. That includes strollers, bottles, diaper pails and car seats The association has asked the Trump administration to exempt baby products from import taxes. Trump gave car seats and high chairs an exemption during his first administration, but it's unclear if he will do that again.",

Oil company BP has paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court. Few have received significant compensation. Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed successful restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in southeast Louisiana.",
