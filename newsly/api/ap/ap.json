      "description": "When Jeffrey Epstein died in prison, then-President Donald Trump speculated that authorities might be wrong in ruling it a suicide. Many of his allies in the pro-Trump media went further, casting Epstein's death as a murder meant to continue a decades-long coverup of pedophilia by elites. Now back in the White House, Trump has elevated prominent proponents of Epstein conspiracies to senior law enforcement roles, and they\u2019re struggling to contain a fire that they spent years stoking. Much of Trump\u2019s base is choosing to believe the president\u2019s earlier claims about Epstein over his latest contention that there\u2019s nothing of substance in government files.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. His public statement Wednesday came less than 24 hours after suggesting in a private meeting that he was leaning in favor of dismissing Powell. Trump confirmed to reporters that in a White House meeting Tuesday night with about a dozen House Republicans, he'd discussed the \u201cconcept\u201d of dismissing Powell. The Fed chair has long been a target because of his refusal to lower interest rates as Trump wants. Trump's team recently has accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed. Trump said Wednesday he's \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to dismiss Powell \u2014 \u201dunless he has to leave for fraud.\u201d",

George Retes, a native of Ventura City, California, says he was pinned to the ground by ICE officials on his back and his neck after getting caught between protesters and authorities last week at Glass House Farms in Camarillo. Retes was held for three days before being release without charges and without being allowed to contact a lawyer. He said Wednesday he plans to sue the federal government over his ordeal.",

It's an action that would have a tiny impact on the nation\u2019s debt but could have major ramifications for future spending fights in Congress. The legislation would claw back nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and about $8 billion in foreign aid spending that Republicans describe as wasteful. Senate passage of the spending cuts would send the bill back to the House for final approval. Trump must sign the bill into law by midnight Friday for the cuts to take effect.",

They fear the repercussions if President Donald Trump follows through with threats to try and remove the politically independent central banker. As Trump seemingly waffled back and forth between moving to dismiss the Fed chair this week, some Republicans in Congress began to speak up to warn that such a move would be a mistake.

A decision to free the Maryland construction worker could allow President Donald Trump's administration to try to deport him for a second time. A hearing to review the matter is scheduled for Wednesday in Nashville. Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint over the Republican administration\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador in March. The U.S. returned Abrego Garcia last month to face the federal smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers say the case is preposterous.",

Eswatini says it is holding the men in correctional facilities until they can be sent back to their home countries. Eswatini is one of a handful of countries in the world that are still absolute monarchies, and the only one in Africa. That means the king has absolute power over government and is not just a figurehead or a ceremonial position. The country was previously known as Swaziland but changed to Eswatini in 2018.",

U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said at a news conference Wednesday that the forged police reports would indicate that the immigrant was a victim of a crime. He said the police officials were paid $5,000 for each name they provided falsified reports for, and that there were hundreds of names. He and other officials said the case does not mean the police chiefs' departments are corrupt.",

They aim to overcome some barriers to retrieving hearts donated after circulatory death, when the heart stops beating after withdrawal of life support. Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities say they've separately devised some simpler approaches. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they describe small but early successes, transplanting an infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt. These are the kinds of transplantable hearts that too often aren\u2019t retrieved depending on how would-be organ donors die.",
