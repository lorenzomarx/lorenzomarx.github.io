      "description": "President Trump is reversing his predecessor\u2019s efforts to clean up areas hardest hit by pollution from heavy industry, ports and roadways \u2013 communities that are often largely Black, Latino and low-income. He eliminated the \u201cJustice 40\u201d initiative the Biden created which required 40% of the benefits from certain environmental programs go to hard-hit communities. He disbanded a team of White House advisors who focus on the issue. It's part of a spate of early executive orders that align with Trump's campaign pledge to slash regulations and eliminate an emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion. The new administration actions end a short-lived federal embrace of environmental justice.",

Few details of the operation were immediately made public, including any arrests. But the sheer number of federal agencies involved showed President Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to use federal law enforcement beyond the Department of Homeland Security to carry out his long-promised mass deportations. Chicago residents have been on edge for weeks in anticipation of mass immigration arrests.",

      "description": "Inflation was a driving force behind Donald Trump's election victory, but he's put the issue on the back burner during his first week in office. He's instead focusing on immigration, which he describes as his top priority. Trump is banking that voters will give him a pass and continue to blame former President Joe Biden for high prices. Trump is working to bring down energy prices by asking oil companies to produce more. But presidents have little direct control over prices of groceries, housing and other things that are frustrating Americans.",

Issues confronting him range from global conflicts and border security to administrative tasks. He'll have to address President Donald Trump\u2019s priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern border. And Hegseth will be reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law enforcement. That's something done rarely. He'll have decisions to make about aid to Ukraine, the ceasefire in Gaza and troop deployments in the Mideast. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the government of diversity programs and personnel.",

Demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter several villages to protest Israel\u2019s failure to withdraw from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish its presence.",
