They fear Israel would never allow them to return. Trump floated the idea on Saturday, saying he would urge the leaders of the two Arab countries to take in Gaza\u2019s now largely homeless population, so that \u201cwe just clean out that whole thing.\u201d He added that resettling Gaza\u2019s population \u201ccould be temporary or long term.\u201d",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he\u2019d like to see Arab nations increase the number of Palestinian refugees they are accepting from the Gaza Strip \u2014 potentially moving out enough of the population to \u201cclean out\u201d the area to create a virtual clean slate. He told reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday that he'd discussed his vision on a call with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with Egypt's president. Trump also said he\u2019s ended his predecessor\u2019s hold on sending 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. That lifts a pressure point meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire.",

      "description": "At least three people were killed and more than 40 others injured in southern Lebanon Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on protesters who had breached roadblocks the Israeli army set up a day before, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry reported. Demonstrators attempted to enter several villages to protest Israel\u2019s failure to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw.",

      "description": "Health officials in Gaza say a Palestinian man was killed and seven people were wounded by Israeli fire overnight. They were among crowds who gathered in hopes of returning to the northern Gaza Strip under a fragile week-old ceasefire, the officials said Sunday. Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza on foot. Israel put the move on hold until Hamas freed a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been freed that day. In a separate development, President Donald Trump suggested that most of Gaza\u2019s population should be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan. Both countries and the Palestinians have previously rejected that idea.",

Kennedy Jr. to become the nation's top health official has put health advocates in an awkward position: voicing support for some of his proposals while warning of the catastrophic consequences of others. The anti-vaccine lawyer has been tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the nation's public health agencies. Later this week he will face questions from Senate lawmakers considering his nomination. While Kennedy's views on vaccines are universally rejected by health experts, they acknowledge that some of his ideas on improving U.S. food and nutrition are sound. Some advocates say they are willing to help Kennedy if he pursues ideas that could improve public health.",

Issues confronting him beginning Monday morning range from global conflicts and border security to administrative tasks. He'll have to address President Donald Trump\u2019s priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern border. And Hegseth will be reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law enforcement. That's something done rarely. He'll have decisions to make about aid to Ukraine, the ceasefire in Gaza and troop deployments in the Mideast.

The new president is acting to seal off the U.S.-Mexico border border to asylum seekers and deport millions of immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. On Capitol Hill, a crucial faction of Democrats are looking for places of agreement with Trump. And in fact, Democrats helped send an immigration bill to his desk during his first week in office. Democrats are searching for a new message on border security and immigration as polls show broad support for tougher measures.",

He's instead focusing on immigration, which he describes as his top priority. Trump is banking that voters will give him a pass and continue to blame former President Joe Biden for high prices. Trump is working to bring down energy prices by asking oil companies to produce more. But presidents have little direct control over prices of groceries, housing and other things that are frustrating Americans.",
