      "description": "Ukrainian authorities say a Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine\u2019s capital killed at least six people including a 6-year-old boy. Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko said Thursday that at least 52 other people were injured in the attacks, and that the number was likely to rise. A large part of a nine-story residential building collapsed after it was struck, Tkachenko added. Rescue teams were at the scene to rescue people trapped under the rubble. Western leaders have accused Putin of dragging his feet in U.S.-led peace efforts in an attempt to capture more Ukrainian land.",

      "description": "Ukraine\u2019s Parliament has approved a bill tabled by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that restores the independence of two of the country\u2019s key anti-corruption watchdogs. The move on Thursday reversed his contentious move last week that curbed their power and brought an outcry. Lawmakers approved Zelenskyy\u2019s new proposal with 331 votes and nine abstentions Thursday. Last week\u2019s measure by Zelenskyy to place the watchdogs under the oversight of the prosecutor general prompted an outcry from Ukrainians, the European Union and international rights groups. It raised fears that the government could meddle in investigations and potentially shield its supporters from scrutiny.",

      "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says Canada will recognize a Palestinian state in September, the latest development in a push against Israel\u2019s Gaza policies. Carney convened a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation there. Pressure to formally recognize Palestinian statehood has mounted since French President Emmanuel Macron announced his country will become the first major Western power to recognize a Palestinian state in September. The United Kingdom made a similar announcement on Tuesday. Though mostly symbolic, Canada's recognition comes as part of a global shift against Israel and could increase diplomatic pressure for an end to the conflict. More than 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state, including a dozen in Europe.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged. In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster tariffs on imports from almost every country in the world. On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington will hear oral arguments in the case, which is likely headed to the Supreme Court. Trump is facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he\u2019s overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",

Pakistani officials did not specify where the exploration would take place, but most of Pakistan\u2019s reserves are believed to be in the insurgency-hit southwestern province of Balochistan, where separatists oppose any foreign investment.

The airline says that the airport fire department and paramedics met the flight Wednesday evening and 25 passengers were taken to hospitals for evaluation and treatment. Serious injuries from in-flight turbulence are rare, but scientists say they may be becoming more common as climate change alters the jet stream. A man was killed when a Singapore Airlines flight hit severe turbulence in May 2024, the first person to die from turbulence on a major airline in several decades.",
