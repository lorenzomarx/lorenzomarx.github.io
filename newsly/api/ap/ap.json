      "description": "An F/A-18 fighter jet landing on the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea went overboard. A defense official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the two pilots were forced to eject. The official said that the incident happened Tuesday. The two pilots on board were later rescued by a helicopter and suffered minor injuries in the incident. None of the crew members on board the Truman were injured. There appeared to have been an issue with the \u201carrestment\u201d device that catches aircraft upon landing.",

      "description": "Three former Memphis officers have been acquitted of state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop in 2023. A jury took about 8 1/2 hours over two days to find Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith not guilty on all charges after a trial in Mempis state court. The three defendants still face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges last year. Nichols fled a 2023 traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and fatally beat him.",

The order from U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy in Massachusetts comes after attorneys said immigration authorities informed migrants of plans to deport them to Libya, a country with a history of human rights violations. Murphy previously found that any migrants deported to countries other than their homelands must first be allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. He said any \u201callegedly imminent\u201d removals would \u201cclearly violate this Court\u2019s Order.\u201d",

Officials from the Al-Aqsa Hospital said on Wednesday that the strikes included one attack on a school sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians, which killed 27 people, including nine women and three children. It was the fifth time since the war began that the school has been struck. Strikes on targets in multiple other areas killed at least 21. The Israeli military had no immediate comment Wednesday on the strikes. Israel blames Hamas for the death toll because it operates from civilian infrastructure, including schools.",

India said it was striking infrastructure used by militants. The strikes came amid soaring tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors over last month\u2019s militant attack on tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the militant attack, which Islamabad has denied. The missiles early Wednesday struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country\u2019s eastern Punjab province, according to three Pakistani security officials.",

The Fed is nearly certain to keep its rate unchanged when it concludes its latest policy meeting Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the Fed wants to see how the duties impact consumer prices and the economy. A big issue is how tariffs will impact inflation. Nearly all economists expect the import taxes will lift prices, but it\u2019s not clear by how much or for how long.",

The proposal prompted outrage from Democrats and environmental groups who called the plan a betrayal that could lead to increased drilling, mining and logging in the West. The plan would sell thousands of acres of public lands in the two states, and calls for some of the parcels to be considered for affordable housing projects. It's now part of Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that is moving through Congress.",
