      "description": "The Supreme Court has blocked, for now, the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th century wartime law. In a brief order early Saturday, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \u201cuntil further order of this court.\u201d Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The high court acted in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",

Chris Van Hollen says Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported, told him he has been moved from the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT to a detention center with better conditions. Van Hollen says the Salvadoran man told him in a meeting Thursday that he had shared a cell with 25 prisoners and was fearful of many of them. The senator, who visited El Salvador, told reporters the case is more than just about Abrego Garcia. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States,\u201d Van Hollen said.",

      "description": "During his campaign, Donald Trump said repeatedly that he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin 24 hours\u201d upon taking office. He has changed his tone since becoming president again. As various U.S. emissaries have held talks looking for an end to the war, both Trump and his top officials have become more reserved about the prospects of a peace deal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday suggested the U.S. might soon back away from negotiations altogether without more progress. Trump's shift is noteworthy given his prior term as president and his long histories with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

The talks Saturday in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Whether the two men find common ground in the high-stakes negotiations could mean success or failure in the talks. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon.",

Political science student Phoenix Ikner was a long-standing member of a sheriff\u2019s office youth advisory council. But when officers rushed to the university\u2019s student union on reports of gunfire, authorities say it was the 20-year-old who used his stepmother\u2019s former service weapon to open fire, killing two men and wounding six others. The chief of safety for Leon County Schools said the allegations underscore that \u201cnone of us are immune to tragedy.\u201d",

The cuts are just a fraction of the grants canceled by the National Endowment for the Humanities in recent weeks as part of the Republican administration\u2019s deep cost-cutting effort across the federal government. But coming on the heels of a major federal boarding school investigation by the previous administration and an apology by then-President Joe Biden, they illustrate a seismic shift.",
