      "description": "A man has sprayed an unknown substance on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar before being tackled to the ground during a town hall she was hosting. The incident took place in Minneapolis, where tensions over federal immigration enforcement have come to a head after agents fatally shot an intensive care nurse and a mother of three this month. The audience cheered as the man was pinned down and his arms were tied behind his back. In video of the incident, someone in the crowd can be heard saying, \u201cOh my god, he sprayed something on her.\u201d Omar continued the town hall after he was ushered out of the room.",

      "description": "The chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and has ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn\u2019t be held in contempt. In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained. The order says Schlitz recognizes that ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary, but that the \u201cextent of ICE\u2019s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary.\u201d",

Crews scrambled Tuesday to repair power outages in the shivering South. Forecasters have warned the winter weather is expected to get worse.

Freezing temperatures have hovered as far south as Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina, with more record lows forecast down into Florida.

The agreement announced Tuesday reflects a new priority for the 27-nation EU, the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, after the Trump administration threatened to impose tariffs because of opposition to American control of Greenland. It comes as many European leaders are calling for limiting the old consensus with Washington in favor of new partnerships across the globe. The accord could affect as many as 2 billion people and will see free trade on almost all goods between the EU\u2019s 27 members and India.",

Ezra Levin from Indivisible predicts up to 9 million participants. This will be the third \"No Kings\" event, following protests last year against Trump's policies. Organizers emphasize nonviolent resistance and ongoing training to defend constitutional rights. They stress that the movement is about preserving democracy, not partisan politics.",
