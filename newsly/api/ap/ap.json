      "description": "President Donald Trump says he's joining some of his top economic advisers for negotiations at the White House over tariffs and trade with a top Japanese official who's traveling to Washington for the talks. The Republican president says in a post on his social media platform he'll attend the meeting Wednesday alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Trump recently announced a round of global tariffs but then quickly put them on hold for 90 days after the markets tanked. Japan's 24% across-the-board tariff is on hold. But a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. remain in place.",

      "description": "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as an EU facilitator when she meets with Donald Trump in the White House. The meeting on Thursday marks the first face-to-face between a European leader and the U.S. president since he announced, and then temporarily suspended, tariffs of 20% on European exports. Meloni is traveling in her role as Italy\u2019s leader, but she has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen ahead of the trip. The 90-day pause on the retaliatory tariffs has raised some hopes for negotiation, and experts say that Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in bringing clarity on Trump's goals than in outright concessions.",

The United Nations meanwhile raised alarm over the mounting impact of Israel\u2019s six-week-old blockade preventing all food and other supplies from entering the territory. Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas last month and renewed its bombardment, killing hundreds of people and seizing large parts of the territory to pressure the militants to accept changes to the agreement. The U.N. humanitarian office said that almost all of Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million people now rely for food on the only 1 million prepared meals produced daily by charity kitchens supported by aid groups.",

The strike was the latest in a string of Russian attacks that have caused civilian casualties and intensified in recent weeks as the United States continues efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. In reaction to the Dnipro attack, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged allies to support the country with air defense weapons. A Ukrainian team is in Paris for a round of talks with allies including France, Germany and the United Kingdom as well as a U.S. delegation.",

U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg said Wedneday that the administration must try to \u201cpurge\u201d itself of a contempt finding or he'll launch hearings and potentially refer the matter for prosecution. The move by Boasberg marks an escalation in a battle between the judicial and executives branches of government over a president\u2019s powers to carry out key White House priorities.",

They are convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. Their attorneys are expected to argue over the course of a two-day hearing starting Thursday that the brothers have worked hard to better themselves and give back to the prison community. They have the support of their extended family. Prosecutors have said they oppose resentencing because the brothers have not admitted to lies told during their trial about why they killed their parents.",

The blackout left 1.4 million customers without electricity and 328,000 without water. About 12% had power back at the end of the day Wednesday. The blackout snarled traffic, forced businesses to close and left those unable to afford generators scrambling to buy ice and candles. It\u2019s the second islandwide blackout in less than four months. The cause wasn't yet known, but Puerto Rico has had chronic outages due to hurricane damage and a lack of maintenance and investment in its power grid.",
