      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to meet with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, in a face-to-face with the onetime insurgent leader who spent years imprisoned by U.S. forces after being captured in Iraq. The White House says Trump has agreed to \u201csay hello\u201d Wednesday to al-Sharaa before the U.S. leader wraps up his visit to Saudi Arabia and moves on to Qatar. Trump is also scheduled to attend a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the grouping of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. He then sets off Wednesday for Qatar, the second stop in his Mideast tour. Trump will be honored with a state dinner in Qatar.",

      "description": "It\u2019s not just the \u201cgesture\u201d of a $400 million luxury plane that President Donald Trump says he\u2019s smart to accept from Qatar. Or that Trump effectively auctioned off the first destination on his first major foreign trip, heading to Saudi Arabia because the kingdom was ready to make big investments in U.S. companies. It\u2019s not even that the Trump family has fast-growing business ties in the Middle East. Instead, it\u2019s the idea that the combination of these things and more could cause the United States to favor Middle Eastern leaders when it comes to American affairs of state. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says it's \u201cridiculous\u201d to suggest Trump is doing anything for his own gain.",

Now, all eyes are finally turning back to Istanbul to seek an end to Russia\u2019s 3-year-old, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed restarting direct peace talks with Ukraine in the Turkish city that straddles Asia and Europe on Thursday \u2013 and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy challenged him to meet in Turkey in person. What will take place remains unclear. The Kremlin has refused to confirm who it will send to Turkey and whether Putin personally will go. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskyy will only sit down with the Russian leader.",

The brothers have spent more than 30 years in prison for killing their parents at their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Their attorneys are expected to argue over the course of a two-day hearing starting Tuesday that the brothers have been rehabilitated in prison, and they have the support of their extended family. Prosecutors have said they oppose resentencing because the brothers have not admitted to lies told during their trial about why they killed their parents.",

Lawyers for three-time Grammy winner told the jury that while Combs could be violent, he never veered into sex trafficking or racketeering. Cassie has been at the center of Combs\u2019 stunning downfall. She sued him in 2023 alleging years of abuse. A surveillance video made public last year showed Combs beating her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",
