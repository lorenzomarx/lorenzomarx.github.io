      "description": "Israel and Iran have struck at one another again a week into their war as President Donald Trump weighs U.S. involvement and new diplomatic efforts appear to be taking place. Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi appeared to be heading to Geneva on Friday for meetings with diplomats from the European Union, United Kingdom, France and Germany. Trump has been weighing whether to attack Iran by striking a uranium enrichment facility so deeply buried it is considered safe from all but America\u2019s \u201cbunker-buster\u201d bombs.",

Khalil has been held since early March while the Trump Administration sought to deport him over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. Lawyers for the Columbia graduate had asked the judge to release him on bail Friday from a Louisiana jail, or else transfer him to New Jersey, where he can be closer to his wife and newborn son. The Trump administration says Khalil must be expelled from the country because his continued presence could harm American foreign policy. His lawyers say the Trump administration is simply trying to crack down on free speech.",

The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs preserves the ability of Harvard to host foreign students while the case is decided. It marks another victory for the Ivy League school as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House. Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency withdrew the school\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas.",

      "description": "Amena Namjoyan arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos as part of a migration crisis that would rock the European Union. She spent months in an overcrowded camp. She struggled with illness and depression. She moved to Germany but eventually returned to Lesbos. She works at a restaurant, preparing Iranian dishes that locals devour. Islanders say this is part of Lesbos' legacy, helping outsiders in need. The migration crisis peaked from 2015 to 2016, and 10 years later the fallout still reverberates on the island and beyond. Migration policy in Europe has shifted toward deterrence. Far fewer people are arriving illegally. Officials and politicians maintain that strong borders are needed. Critics say enforcement has gone too far and violates fundamental EU values.",

And now the monthly cash transfers to buy proteins and vegetables to supplement them are gone. Funding for the U.N. World Food Program has dropped after the Trump administration paused support in March. It's part of the widespread dismantling of foreign aid by the United States, once the world\u2019s biggest donor. Some refugees are surviving on one meal a day. Some malnourished babies arrive too late at a local hospital and die within hours. Workers fear they will see more.",

The vote Friday could be one of the most consequential social decisions they will ever make. It's potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was legalized in 1967. Members of Parliament approved assisted dying when they first debated the issue in November by a 330-275 vote. It since has undergone months of scrutiny leading to some changes in the proposed legislation that has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
