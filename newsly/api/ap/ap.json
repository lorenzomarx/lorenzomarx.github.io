The government says, \"Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement.\u201d Justice Department lawyers are urging a judge to reject the effort. The government says Operation Metro Surge has made the state safer with the arrests of more than 3,000 people who were in the country illegally. But Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights.",

On Tuesday, crews bulldozed the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's offices in Sheikh Jarrah and fired tear gas at a vocational school in Qalandia. The agency's West Bank director, Roland Friedrich, said this marks the culmination of two years of measures against UNRWA in east Jerusalem. Israel's Foreign Ministry said the demolition enforced a new law banning UNRWA, claiming the agency has ties with militant groups. The U.N. has denied these claims. Israel has long claimed the agency has an anti-Israel bias, often with little evidence.",

      "description": "Forecasters are warning that a new storm could bring ice and power outages across the South this weekend. Temperatures will be slow to warm in many areas, meaning ice that forms on roads and sidewalks might stick around. The exact timing and path remain uncertain, but an arctic air mass from Canada is expected to clash with rain, creating a major winter storm. An atmospheric river could pull moisture across the Gulf Coast, increasing the risk of ice storms in Georgia. Travel disruptions are likely, especially in areas with limited snow removal equipment. Northern states will remain in a deep freeze due to polar air.",

Experts fear the vaccine-preventable virus has regained a foothold and that the U.S. may soon follow Canada in losing the achievement of having eliminated it.

But regardless of the U.S. elimination status, doctors and scientists say the country has a measles problem. At the April meeting, international health officials also will review Mexico\u2019s measles-free status. Its measles outbreak is connected to last year\u2019s Texas outbreak.",

No president has fired a Fed governor in the agency\u2019s 112-year history. Trump's critics say he wants to take control of U.S. interest rate policy. The Republican president wants interest rates to fall so Americans pay lower borrowing costs for homes and cars. Worries about high costs have soured some voters on Trump's economic management.",
