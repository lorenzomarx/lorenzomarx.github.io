      "description": "House Republicans have muscled their budget blueprint to passage, with a push from President Donald Trump. The vote late Tuesday evening is a crucial step toward delivering what he's called his \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts. It kickstarts a weeks-long process to draft the details and merge with the Senate. The vote was 217-215 with all Democrats opposed. But even some Republicans are uneasy. As Elon Musk is tearing through the federal government, Republicans are being hammered at town halls back home. It's a familiar GOP problem that slashing federal spending is easier said than done, as constituents rely on Medicaid and other programs and services.",

      "description": "The acting administrator of the organization that is pushing for sweeping budget cuts across federal agencies is a low-profile executive who has expertise in health care technology and worked in the first Trump administration. The White House identified Amy Gleason as the acting leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, which was created by the Trump organization to find waste, fraud and abuse in the government. Gleason, 53, worked from 2018 through 2021 in the United States Digital Service, an agency that has been renamed the US DOGE Service, according to her LinkedIn profile. In that role, she worked with the White House on the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic.",

Immigration officials announced the registry efforts Tuesday. They said everyone who's in the U.S. illegally must register, give fingerprints and provide an address. Officials cited a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act as justification for registration, which would apply to anyone 14 and older. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to make good on campaign promises to carry out mass deportations and seal the border to future asylum-seekers. On its website, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service said it would soon create a form and process for registration.",

The judge says the administration has given no sign of complying with his nearly two-week-old court order to ease its funding freeze. The lawsuit was brought by nonprofit organizations over the cutoff of funding through the U.S. Agency for International Development and State Department. The cutoff followed an executive order by President Donald Trump targeting what he portrayed as wasteful programs that do not correspond to his foreign policy goals. Nonprofit groups who receive federal money for work abroad say the freeze breaks federal law and has shut down funding for even the most urgent life-saving programs abroad.",

The deal Tuesday keeps their fragile ceasefire intact for at least a few more days. Israel has delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The militant group says the delay is a \u201cserious violation\u201d of their ceasefire. and that talks on a second phase are not possible until they are freed. The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire. But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute.",

That departs from a century of tradition in which a pool of independent news organizations go where the chief executive does and holds him accountable on behalf of regular Americans.

She cast the change as a modernization of the press pool, saying the move would restore \u201caccess back to the American people\u201d who elected Trump.",
