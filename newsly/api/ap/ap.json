      "description": "A deadly midair collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter near the nation's capital is bringing renewed focus on the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has described the investigation into Wednesday night's crash as an \u201call-hands-on-deck event\u201d for her agency. She appeared at a news conference Thursday with members of the board and a senior investigator overseeing the probe. The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents and other serious incidents in the U.S. Authorities say 60 passengers and four crew died aboard the jet and three soldiers aboard the helicopter.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's remarks this week blaming diversity recruitment at the FAA as a potential reason for the plane crash that killed 67 people has drawn attention to the agency\u2019s attempts to address its most pressing and long-standing staffing problem. The FAA had a persistent shortage of air traffic controllers for years and has used a diversity hiring program as one strategy to fill those and other slots. No evidence has emerged that rules seeking to diversify the FAA played any role in the collision. The diversity program has been ongoing for years, including during Trump's first term, and experts familiar with it say all candidates must meet the same FAA qualifications no matter the job.",

That was the word from authorities Thursday as they scrutinized the actions of the military pilot after the country\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the jet late Wednesday while it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.",

      "description": "Airline pilots flying into Washington, D.C., have reported nearly a dozen near misses over the years that were scarily similar to this week's midair collision that killed 67 people. They are the type of close calls that led one aviator to complain that Reagan National Airport was \u201cprobably the most dangerous\u201d in the nation. Such complaints highlighted the uneasy tension that has developed between commercial airline pilots unnerved by the helicopters and the military units that have critical national security duties near the airport and must maintain flying skills to execute them. The Federal Aviation Administration paused almost all helicopter flights from operating near the airport.",

That's according to two people familiar with the plans. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, but officials acting at the direction of the administration were working to identify individual agents who could be terminated, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. Among the politically explosive investigations involving Trump over the last four years were inquiries into his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents, as well as hundreds of criminal cases against rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",

      "description": "A New York doctor has been indicted by a Lousiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country. Dr. Margaret Carpenter and her company, Nightingale Medical were charged on Friday with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",

The two aircraft went into the Potomac River Wednesday night, killing all 67 aboard. D.C.'s fire chief said Friday that 41 bodies have been recovered. The passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip. The cause is under investigation and first responders continue searching the river. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says a key question is how high the helicopter was flying.",

The rules govern how complaints of misconduct are investigated and how to settle cases where students present differing accounts.
