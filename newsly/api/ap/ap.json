      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff says that a three to five year timeline for reconstruction of Gaza, as set out in a temporary truce agreement, is not viable. The U.S. administration reiterated its call on Tuesday for Arab nations to relocate displaced Palestinians in the war-torn territory. Witkoff said \u201cit is unfair to explain to Palestinians that they might be back in five years.\u201d He added that such a timeline is \u201cpreposterous.\u201d The administration renewed its call on Arab nations to relocate displaced Palestinians as Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Egypt and Jordan, as well other Arab nations, have rejected calls by Trump to relocate the territory\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians during post-war rebuilding.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will withdraw from the U.N.\u2019s top human rights body and will not resume funding for the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees. The U.S. left the Geneva-based Human Rights Council last year. And it stopped funding the agency assisting Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, after Israel accused it of harboring Hamas militants who participated in the attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which UNRWA denies. Trump\u2019s announcement Tuesday came on the day he met with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country has long accused both the rights body and UNRWA of bias against Israel and antisemitism.",

Trump adds that \"there won\u2019t be anything left\u201d if Iran kills him. He made the remarks in an exchange with reporters Tuesday while signing an executive order calling for the U.S. government to impose maximum pressure on Tehran. The Justice Department announced in federal charges in November that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential election had been thwarted. The department alleged Iranian officials had instructed Farhad Shakeri, 51, in September to focus on surveilling and ultimately assassinating Trump. Shakeri is still believed to be at large in Iran.",

An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods is likely drive up prices for ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms, toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones. The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts. The tariffs on Chinese imports took effect after President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days.",

      "description": "When Donald Trump started the biggest trade war since the 1930s in his first term, his impulsive combination of threats and import taxes on U.S. trading partners created chaos, generated drama -- and drew criticism from mainstream economists who favor free trade. But it didn\u2019t do much damage to the U.S. economy. Or much good. The trade war sequel that Trump has said he\u2019s planned for his second term could likely be costlier. Trump seems to have grander ambitions and is operating in a far more treacherous economic environment, one in which his tariffs risk rekindling inflation.",
