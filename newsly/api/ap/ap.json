      "description": "The House is expected to approve President Donald Trump\u2019s request to claw back about $9 billion for public broadcasting and foreign aid. A final vote to approve the spending cuts package is scheduled for Thursday evening. Republicans are targeting institutions and programs they view as bloated or out of step with their agenda. The White House has described the package as a test case and says if Congress goes along, more requests will come. The House\u2019s approval would mark the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a request to Congress.",

      "description": "House Republicans are trying to formulate a response to the Trump administration\u2019s handling of records in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. They ultimately put forward a resolution Thursday that carried no legal weight but nodded to the growing demand for greater transparency. The House resolution could potentially be voted on next week. It will do practically nothing to force the Justice Department to release more records in the case. Still, the Republican response showed how backlash from the Republican base is putting pressure on the Trump administration and roiling GOP lawmakers.",

      "description": "In the last two months, dozens of Russian regions have been hit by cellphone connectivity outages. Officials say such disruptions are needed to foil Ukrainian drone attacks. Areas affected range from those near the fighting to parts of Siberia and even the Far East. In some regions, Wi-Fi outages also have been reported. Russians contacted by The Associated Press describe the inconveniences as surmountable \u2014 ride-sharing apps don\u2019t work and ATMs sometimes fail. But experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far-reaching consequences in a country where online freedom already is curtailed significantly.",

An official said the blaze at the newly-opened shopping center in Wasit province killed a total of 63 people, including 18 victims who remain unidentified due to severe burns. The fire broke out late Wednesday on the second floor of the Corniche Hypermarket mall, which had opened just days before. Civil defense crews rescued 45 people. Most victims were trapped on upper floors. Officials blame poor safety standards and lack of permits for the tragedy. Legal complaints had been filed against the building owner and shopping center owner.",

      "description": "Members of Syria's Druze community are searching for loved ones and counting their dead after days of clashes in a southern province that left bloodied bodies of civilians on the streets and homes looted. The fighting in Sweida province this week began with tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze armed factions. Government forces that intervened to restore order clashed with the Druze militias, but also in some cases attacked civilians. One monitoring group said dozens of civilians were rounded up by fighters and shot and killed. The violence has left Druze more skeptical of Syria\u2019s new leadership and doubtful of peaceful coexistence.",

      "description": "A new AP-NORC poll shows that while Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, everyday Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy. About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the wealthy, according to the survey. Most \u2014 about 6 in 10 \u2014 think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people. About half say it will do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them. Republicans have already begun airing advertisements framing the legislation as a tax cut for all Americans, but the new poll indicates that they have some persuading to do.",

Long, who once advocated for abolishing the IRS, takes over an agency struggling with staffing cuts and leadership turnover. He was confirmed by the Senate last month despite Democratic concerns over his ties to a tax credit scheme and campaign contributions linked to his nomination by then President-elect Donald Trump. Long, who lacks tax administration experience, has pledged to improve the agency's culture. His appointment follows a trend of Trump appointees leading agencies they previously criticized or sought to dismantle.",
