      "description": "Cardinals are returning to the Sistine Chapel to continue voting for a new pope. The first conclave ballot failed to find a winner, sending black smoke through the chapel chimney. Some cardinals expected a short conclave to replace Pope Francis, but it may take a few rounds of voting for one man to secure the two-thirds majority needed. The secretive ritual began Wednesday with Cardinal Pietro Parolin leading the proceedings. Thousands gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square to watch the event on video screens. The cardinals are sequestered from the outside world until they find a new pope.",

      "description": "Robert Prevost was brought to the Vatican in 2023 by Pope Francis as the powerful head of the office that vets bishop nominations, one of the most important jobs in the Catholic Church. On Thursday, he ascended to become Pope Leo XIV \u2014 the first American pontiff. Prevost, 69, had to overcome the taboo against a U.S. pope, given the geopolitical power already wielded by the United States in the secular sphere. The Chicago native is also a Peruvian citizen and lived for years in Peru, first as a missionary and then as an archbishop.",

That's happening under a new directive issued Thursday. Buoyed by Tuesday\u2019s Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on transgender individuals in the military, the Defense Department will then begin going through medical records to identify others who haven\u2019t come forward. Department officials have said it\u2019s difficult to determine exactly how many transgender service members there are, but medical records will show those who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, who show symptoms or are being treated. Those troops would then be involuntarily forced out of the service.",

How much it will all cost wasn\u2019t immediately revealed.

The International Organization for Migration estimates that Libya has some 800,000 migrants and refugees seeking work or who have fled war in their home countries. A U.N.-backed independent fact-finding mission found evidence that crimes against humanity had been committed against migrants in Libya.
