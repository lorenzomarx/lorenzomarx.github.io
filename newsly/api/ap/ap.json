      "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a key scientific finding that supported U.S. regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. This decision rescinds a 2009 declaration that carbon dioxide and other gases endanger public health. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the move Thursday, calling it a major deregulatory action. Critics argue it undermines efforts to combat climate change and could lead to more pollution. Environmental groups are certain to challenge the action in court. The EPA also proposes delaying a Biden-era rule on vehicle emissions, which could impact the push for electric vehicles.",

      "description": "Federal officials have announced an end to an immigration crackdown in Minnesota that led to mass detentions, protests and two deaths. Border czar Tom Homan made the announcement during a news conference Thursday. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1. Federal authorities say the sweeps focused on the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area have led to the arrest of more than 4,000 people. While the Trump administration has called those arrested \u201cdangerous criminal illegal aliens,\u201d many people with no criminal records, including children and U.S. citizens, have also been detained.",

Lawmakers in the House and Senate are set to leave Washington for a 10-day break, while negotiations with the White House over Democrats\u2019 demands for new restrictions have stalled. The White House and Democrats have traded offers in recent days. Democrats have said they want curbs on President Donald Trump\u2019s broad campaign of immigration enforcement. They've demanded better identification for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement officers, a new code of conduct for those agencies and more use of judicial warrants, among their requests.",

Mark Kelly, a former U.S. Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled Thursday that Pentagon officials have violated Kelly\u2019s First Amendment free speech rights. Kelly, who represents Arizona, sued in federal court to block his Jan. 5 censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration.",

The ruling likely ends a bitter, yearslong legal battle over the girl\u2019s fate. Four justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing two lower courts\u2019 rulings that found the adoption was so flawed it was void from the moment it was issued. The justices wrote that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child\u2019s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.",

      "description": "A new study says genetic testing can speed the return of the American chestnut tree that once dominated Eastern U.S. forests. The tree was functionally extinct by the 1950s because of a fungal blight and root rot. Researchers want the height and character of the American chestnut with the disease resistance of the shorter, Chinese chestnut. Their work found that resistance involves many genes, not one. Genetic screening helps pick the best seedlings, and faster. Some experts say gene editing would make the process even faster, while others worry that hybrids will never fully replace a true American chestnut.",
