      "description": "An American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members has collided with an Army helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the nearby Potomac River. There were multiple fatalities, according to a person familiar with the matter, but the precise number of victims was unclear. There was no immediate word on the cause of the collision late Wednesday. All takeoffs and landings from the airport were halted as helicopters from law enforcement agencies across the region flew over the scene in search of survivors. Inflatable rescue boats were launched into the Potomac, just north of the airport. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to say how many bodies had been recovered.",

      "description": "Hamas-led militants have freed eight hostages as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. But the chaotic handover of some of the captives drew an angry protest from Israel. The hostages were shuttled through a rowdy crowd of thousands by masked militants. Israel later began releasing 110 Palestinian prisoners after the swap was initially put on hold by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He demanded that mediators assure the safe exit for hostages going forward. He said later that he had received that commitment.",

      "description": "A police investigator told the man who fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery that he wasn't being arrested in an interview roughly two hours after the killing. Jurors in Georgia watched video of the February 2020 police interview Wednesday as they began hearing evidence in the trial of former District Attorney Jackie Johnson. She's charged with hindering the police investigation into Arbery's death nearly five years ago. No arrests were made for more than two months. But Johnson's defense attorneys blame police for jumping to a faulty conclusion that Arbery was legally shot after committing a crime. The video showed shooter Travis McMichael's first police interview. An investigator tells him: \u201cYou're going home today.\u201d",

The instructions were published Tuesday in a Defense Intelligence Agency memo obtained by The Associated Press and affect 11 annual events, including Black History Month, which begins Saturday, and National Hispanic Heritage Month. An official says the pause was initiated by the agency and appears not to be policy across the Defense Department. A spokesman for the DIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "description": "Donald Trump 2.0 is, so far, very much the same as his first go around. But eight years after he was last sworn into office, the new president is emboldened, far more experienced and surrounded by a very different team. The marathon Q&A sessions are back, along with the cream Oval Office rug and old Diet Coke button. So, too, are the late-night social media posts that ricochet across the globe and swallow news cycles. He\u2019s signed a barrage of executive orders that are testing the bounds of presidential power, sowing confusion and drawing fury from Democrats unsure how to stop him.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump says he will use a detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay to hold tens of thousands of criminal immigrants in the U.S. illegally. While the U.S. naval base is best known for the suspects brought in after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it also has a separate facility used for decades to hold detained immigrants. The U.S. has leased Guant\u00e1namo from Cuba for more than a century. Cuba opposes the lease and typically rejects the nominal U.S. rent payments. Trump signed a presidential memorandum and said he'd direct federal officials to get facilities ready. Border czar Tom Homan said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would run the facility. Still, details of the plan weren\u2019t immediately clear.",
