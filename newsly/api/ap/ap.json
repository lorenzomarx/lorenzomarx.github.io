      "description": "President Donald Trump has celebrated the 100th day of his second term \u2014 yet spent much of his rally marking it in campaign mode, fixated on past grudges and grievances. He repeatedly mocked his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, at Tuesday's rally \u2014 attacking Biden's mental acuity and even how he appears in a bathing suit. He again uttered the lie that he won the 2020 presidential election. And he attacked polling and news coverage not favorable to him. And the rally just outside Detroit, which marked Trump\u2019s largest political event since returning to the White House, glossed over two forces that had rocked the state: his steep trade tariffs and combative attitude toward Canada.",

      "description": "Canada\u2019s Liberals are celebrating election victory in a stunning turn of fortune. The country won't know until later Tuesday whether the party of new Prime Minister Mark Carney will have an outright majority or need help in Parliament. And the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation projects that populist Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre will lose his Parliament seat. That caps a stunning turnaround in fortunes fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s annexation threats and trade war. Poilievre a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.",

      "description": "The White House says President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Tuesday to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts. It's a significant reversal as the import taxes threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers. Automakers and independent analyses have indicated that the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined in a briefing with reporters to provide details of the relief. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who joined Leavitt at the briefing, says the goal is to enable automakers to create more domestic manufacturing jobs.",

The FBI took Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan into custody on Friday morning at the county courthouse. She faces federal charges of concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest and obstructing or impeding a proceeding. The state Supreme Court issued a two-page order Tuesday noting that Dugan faces two federal charges and saying it is in the public interest to temporarily relieve her of her duties. Her attorney had no immediate comment. Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to chill the nation\u2019s judiciary.",

Authorities say it appears the crash Monday, in which a car barreled through the building in Chatham, was not a targeted attack. Details about the investigation are still emerging, including the cause of the crash. Illinois State Police say the 44-year-old driver is not in custody. She was not injured but was taken to a hospital for evaluation, and toxicology reports are pending. Chatham is about 12 miles from the state capital, Springfield.",

Cardinal Angelo Becciu\u2019s status has dominated discussions in the days after Pope Francis\u2019 death amid questions about whether he would participate in the conclave to elect his successor. After his 2020 downfall, Becciu had said he would not participate in any future conclave. But in recent days he had asserted he had a right to enter the Sistine Chapel with other cardinals on May 7. On Tuesday, the 76-year-old Italian issued a statement through his lawyers that said he had \u201cdecided to obey\u201d the will of Pope Francis.",
