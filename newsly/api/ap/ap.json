      "description": "As Ukraine approached the three-year mark of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, the country\u2019s hoped-for path to a favorable and lasting peace has been upended in a matter of days by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Kyiv had benefited from years of staunch support by its allies in the United States and Europe which had provided crucial military and financial support to help defend against Moscow\u2019s grinding incursions. But when Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week \u2014 undoing years of U.S. policy to isolate the Russian leader \u2014 it was taken as a signal in Kyiv and other European capitals that their alliance to contain Moscow was fraying.",

      "description": "The United States has proposed a draft resolution for the U.N. General Assembly that stops far short of a competing European-backed statement demanding an immediate withdrawal of all of Moscow\u2019s forces from Ukraine. Both are timed to the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which falls on Monday, when the General Assembly will vote on the nonbinding resolutions. It pits the United States against Europe as the strength of the transatlantic alliance has been called into question over the Trump administration\u2019s extraordinary turnaround on Russia.",

      "description": "The White House and Ukraine have made significant progress toward reaching an agreement that would provide the U.S. with access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals and tighten the long-term relationship between Kyiv and Washington. That's according to a person familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to comment publicly. The progress in talks comes after President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traded sharp rhetoric this week about their differences over the matter. But the two sides made significant progress during a three-day visit to Ukraine this week by retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",

      "description": "A crash landing of a Delta Air Lines flight in Toronto has highlighted the potential dangers of flying with a young child on an adult's lap. The plane flipped over this week, which would have made holding onto a baby extremely difficult. Airline plane crashes are rare despite the recent rash of aviation disasters, but children could easily get hurt if they are on a parent's lap when a plane encounters turbulence. Experts agree it\u2019s safer for children younger than 2 years old to have their own plane seats and ride in approved car seats when flying even if families have to pay for an extra ticket. Still, it isn't required.",
