      "description": "House Republicans are preparing to vote on their multi-trillion-dollar package of tax breaks and program cuts as soon as Wednesday. They have been grinding out last-minute deal-making and an all-night committee hearing to shore up support and deliver on President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priority. Trump himself had instructed the Republican majority to quit arguing and get it done. But GOP leaders worked late into the night to convince skeptical Republicans who have problems on several fronts, including worries that it will pile onto the nation\u2019s $36 trillion debt. A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the tax provisions would add $3.8 trillion to federal deficits.",

      "description": "Hospitals in Gaza say Israeli strikes overnight and into Wednesday have killed at least 45 people, including several women and a week-old infant. Israel began allowing dozens of humanitarian trucks into Gaza on Tuesday, but the aid has not yet reached Palestinians in desperate need, according to aid groups. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israel recently ordered new evacuations pending an expected expanded offensive, 24 people were killed, 14 of them from the same family. The week-old infant was killed in central Gaza.",

That's what hospital staff and aid groups said this week as Israel pursued its renewed offensive into the devastated Palestinian territory. The Indonesian hospital and Al-Awda hospital are among the region\u2019s only surviving medical centers. Israeli authorities issued evacuation orders Friday for large parts of northern Gaza ahead of attacks intended to pressure the Hamas militant group to release more hostages. New evacuation orders followed Tuesday. The World Health Organization said hospitals in northern Gaza are at risk of shutting down completely.",

The Kremlin said Wednesday that Putin visited Kursk on the border with Ukraine the day before. Ukrainian forces made a surprise incursion into Kursk in August 2024 in the largest cross-border raid by Kyiv\u2019s forces in the nearly 2 \u00bd-year war, before being pushed out my Russian troops nine months later. Ukraine has not confirmed its expulsion from the area. Putin visited Kursk Nuclear Power Plant-2, which is still under construction, and spoke at a closed meeting with selected volunteers.",

A local deputy commissioner said the attack occurred in Khuzdar, a district in Balochistan province, as the bus was transporting children to their school in the city. No group immediately claimed responsibility, though suspicion is likely to fall on ethnic Baloch separatists, who frequently target security forces and civilians in the region. Balochistan has been the scene of a long-running insurgency, with an array of separatist groups staging attacks, including the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, designated as a terror organization by the United States in 2019.",

LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is set to have her first appearance in federal court on assault charges stemming from immigration officials\u2019 attempt to arrest the Newark mayor outside a detention facility. The hearing is set for Wednesday. The interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, charged McIver, a twice-elected member of Congress, this week with two counts of assaulting, resisting and impeding an officer. McIver has denied the charges, and Democrats have rallied to her defense. The prosecutor\u2019s complaint says McIver attempted to block the arrest of Mayor Ras Baraka and pushed into and grabbed federal agents.",

Israeli leaders say the system isn\u2019t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties during the conflict unleashed by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack.",
