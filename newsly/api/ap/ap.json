      "description": "The Senate is slogging through an overnight session as Republican leaders search for ways to secure support for President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts. For almost 18 hours the Senate has been in what's called vote-a-rama, fending off proposed amendments mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota is working to strike a last-minute agreement between Republicans worried the bill\u2019s reductions to Medicaid will leave millions without care and his conservative flank seeking steeper cuts to hold down deficits ballooning with the tax cuts. Trump urged them on in a midnight social media post.",

      "description": "At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it\u2019s up to the Republican-controlled Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump\u2019s signature\u2019s domestic policy package will become law. The bill is nearing a final Senate vote. If it passes, it would then move to the House. Democrats are united against it. The bill would make permanent many of the tax breaks passed in Trump's first term while adding new ones such as no tax on tips or overtime.",

But weeks after Bondi\u2019s claim about \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Epstein videos, it's unclear what she was referring to. The Associated Press spoke with lawyers and law enforcement officials in criminal cases of Epstein and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell who said they hadn\u2019t seen and didn\u2019t know of recordings like what Bondi described. One of Maxwell's lawyers says salacious videos of Epstein with children never surfaced. The department has declined AP requests to speak with officials overseeing the Epstein review.",

Ukrainian officials say the plant produces drones and air defense systems. The attack Tuesday came as Ukraine prioritizes drone development to counter Russia's expanded drone attacks. Both nations are ramping up drone capabilities, turning the war into a testing ground for advanced unmanned weaponry. In June, Russia launched a record 5,438 drones at Ukraine, according to data collated by The Associated Press. Ukraine has been using long-range drones to target Russian facilities deep inside its territory. Meanwhile, Russian drones struck a large southern Ukrainian city, leaving many without power.",

Paetongtarn has faced growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the latest border dispute with Cambodia in which a Cambodian soldier was killed.
