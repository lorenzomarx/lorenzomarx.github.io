      "description": "The Supreme Court has rejected the Trump administration\u2019s appeal to quickly resume deportations of Venezuelans under an 18th century wartime law. Over two dissenting votes, the justices acted Friday on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men who have been accused of being gang members. The administration says that designation makes them eligible for rapid removal from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The high court had already called a temporary halt to the deportations from a north Texas detention facility in a middle-of-the-night order issued last month. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.",

But renegade conservatives have warned they'll vote against it Friday without further changes. Tallying a whopping 1,116 pages, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is teetering at a critical moment. Conservatives are holding out for steeper cuts to Medicaid and other programs to help offset the costs of the tax breaks. Lawmakers from high-tax states including New York are demanding a deeper local tax deduction. House Speaker Mike Johnson insists Republicans are on track with the bill he says will shore up the economy.",

A Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov sat down Friday with a low-level Russian team headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. That's according to Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson who published a photo of the meeting. The officials present sat around a U-shaped table, with the Russians and Ukrainians facing each other. Officials and observers expect the Turkish-brokered talks to yield little immediate progress on stopping the more than three-year war.",
