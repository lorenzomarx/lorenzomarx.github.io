      "description": "Thousands of protesters took to the street in Los Angeles on Sunday in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. The demonstrations centered on a cluster of federal buildings including a detention center where immigrants arrested on Friday were taken. As the protests swelled on Sunday, demonstrators blocked a freeway entrance, set self-driving cars on fire and threw objects including concrete and electric scooters at law enforcement officers and vehicles. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell says some of the protesters engaging in the most aggressive behavior are agitators looking to cause trouble.",

      "description": "Tropical Storm Barbara was strengthening off Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast and could become a hurricane Monday. U.S. forecasters said Barbara was centered about 235 miles west-southwest of the touristic port of Zihuatanejo in Guerrero state late Sunday. It had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving west-northwest. The storm was forecast to remain at sea, though heavy rainfall may cause flooding and mudslides on Mexico\u2019s western coast. Around 2 to 4 inches of rain were possible across portions of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco states through Monday. That has the potential to cause localized flooding and landslides. Surf and rip current conditions could be life-threatening for the next few days.",
