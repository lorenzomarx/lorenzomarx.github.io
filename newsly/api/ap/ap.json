      "description": "The Trump administration has released records of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate\u2019s family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination. The release involves an estimated 200,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977. King\u2019s family, including his two living children, Martin III and Bernice, were given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure. The release is part of President Donald Trump\u2019s order to publicly disclose government files on King and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.",

      "description": "A federal judge has sentenced an ex-Kentucky police officer to nearly three years in prison for using excessive force during the 2020 deadly Breonna Taylor raid, declining a U.S. Justice Department recommendation that no prison time be given the defendant. Brett Hankison, who fired 10 shots during the raid but didn\u2019t hit anyone, was the only officer on the scene charged in the Black woman's death. He is the first person sentenced to prison in the case that rocked the city of Louisville and spawned weeks of street protests over police brutality five years ago. U.S. District Judge Grady Jennings sentenced Hankison at a hearing Monday afternoon.",

      "description": "Harvard University appears in federal court Monday, challenging $2.6 billion in funding cuts by the Trump administration. The university accuses the government of using funding as leverage to control its academic decisions. The cuts followed Harvard's rejection of demands from a federal antisemitism task force. The task force wanted sweeping changes to Harvard's policies on campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard, with a $53 billion endowment, has self-funded some research but warns it can't cover all losses. The Trump administration denies retaliation, stating the cuts align with its policies.",
