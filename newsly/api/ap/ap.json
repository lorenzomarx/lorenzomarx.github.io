      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff says that a three to five year timeline for reconstruction of Gaza, as set out in a temporary truce agreement, is not viable. The U.S. administration reiterated its call on Tuesday for Arab nations to relocate displaced Palestinians in the war-torn territory. Witkoff said \u201cit is unfair to explain to Palestinians that they might be back in five years.\u201d He added that such a timeline is \u201cpreposterous.\u201d The administration renewed its call on Arab nations to relocate displaced Palestinians as Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Egypt and Jordan, as well other Arab nations, have rejected calls by Trump to relocate the territory\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians during post-war rebuilding.",

The Senate Intelligence Committee voted behind closed doors Tuesday to advance Gabbard's nomination to the full Senate for a vote. Gabbard is a former Democratic congresswoman and one of Trump's more divisive nominees, given past comments sympathetic to Russia, her meeting with Syria\u2019s now-deposed leader and her past support for government leaker Edward Snowden. Given thin Republican margins in the Senate, she will need almost all GOP senators to vote yes in order to win confirmation.",

Trump adds that \"there won\u2019t be anything left\u201d if Iran kills him. He made the remarks in an exchange with reporters Tuesday while signing an executive order calling for the U.S. government to impose maximum pressure on Tehran. The Justice Department announced in federal charges in November that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential election had been thwarted. The department alleged Iranian officials had instructed Farhad Shakeri, 51, in September to focus on surveilling and ultimately assassinating Trump.

      "description": "When Donald Trump started the biggest trade war since the 1930s in his first term, his impulsive combination of threats and import taxes on U.S. trading partners created chaos, generated drama -- and drew criticism from mainstream economists who favor free trade. But it didn\u2019t do much damage to the U.S. economy. Or much good. The trade war sequel that Trump has said he\u2019s planned for his second term could likely be costlier. Trump seems to have grander ambitions and is operating in a far more treacherous economic environment, one in which his tariffs risk rekindling inflation.",
