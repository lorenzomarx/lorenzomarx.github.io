      "description": "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is defending the Justice Department\u2019s decision to release just a fraction of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the congressionally mandated deadline. Blanche is pledging that the Trump administration will eventually meet its obligation required by law. But he tells NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that his department was obligated to act with caution as it goes about releasing thousands of documents that can include sensitive information. Friday\u2019s partial release of the Epstein files has led to a new crush of criticism from Democrats. They accuse the Trump administration of trying to hide information. Blanche calls the pushback disingenuous.",

      "description": "Israel's Cabinet has approved a proposal for 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. The far-right finance minister, Betzalel Smotrich, announced the decision on Sunday. The settlements include two that were previously evacuated during a 2005 disengagement plan. Smotrich, who supports settlement expansion, noted that this brings the total number of new settlements over the past two years to 69. According to Peace Now, an anti-settlement group, this approval increases the number of settlements by nearly 50% during the current government's tenure. Settlements are widely considered illegal under international law.",

      "description": "Christian influencers are reaching hundreds of thousands of young people online. They share podcasts and videos with biblical advice on tough questions that aren't always answered in Sunday sermons. Followers relate to millennial and Generation Z influencers more than the buttoned-up pastors of their parents' generation. And these influencers open up about past and present mistakes. Some have theological training and some don't. Some experts worry that they aren't equipped to teach such large audiences and threaten to replace church with podcasts, but many faithful are hopeful that this new group of Christian influencers will galvanize young people who are looking for meaning.",

Many wore costumes and arrived before dawn in southwest England. Some sang and beat drums, while others reflected among the huge stone pillars. The ancient monument was built to align with the sun's movement on the winter and summer solstices, important dates for ancient farmers. Sunday marks the shortest day of the year north of the equator. Many celebrate it as a time of renewal, as the days will now start getting longer.",
