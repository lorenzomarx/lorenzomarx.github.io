      "description": "Senate Democrats are poised to block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies on Thursday. That would bring the government a step closer to a partial shutdown if Republicans and the White House do not agree to new restrictions on President Donald Trump\u2019s surge of immigration enforcement. As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest.",

      "description": "Venezuela's legislature has approved opening the nation's oil sector to privatization. This decision reverses a key principle of the socialist movement that has ruled for over two decades. The National Assembly approved the energy industry law overhaul on Thursday. This move comes less than a month after the U.S. military seized then-President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s capital. The bill now awaits the signature of acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez. She proposed the changes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to take control of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports and attract foreign investment to revitalize the industry.",

Homan suggested during a news conference Thursday that a drawdown would happen only after \u2018cooperation\u2019 from state officials.

      "description": "President Donald Trump has held his first Cabinet meeting of 2026, focusing on the economy, housing, energy, health initiatives and drug prices. He painted a positive picture of his administration's accomplishments, but some claims were exaggerated. Trump mentioned $18 trillion in investments, but evidence suggests this figure is inflated. The White House website lists a lower number, $9.6 trillion, which includes commitments from the Biden era. On housing, claims of a sharp rise in home sales are overstated. The National Association of Realtors reported only a 1.4% increase in December. Additionally, Trump's statements on California wildfires and water supply were inaccurate.",

Officials say it could be days before power is restored across the South and more subfreezing temperatures are expected by Friday. The growing misery and anxiety comes amid what Mississippi officials say is the state\u2019s worst winter storm in more than 30 years. Roughly 298,000 homes and businesses remained without power Wednesday night. The vast majority of them are in Tennessee and Mississippi, where many are unaccustomed to and ill-equipped for freeing temperatures. At least 70 people have died across the U.S. in states afflicted by the dangerous cold.",
