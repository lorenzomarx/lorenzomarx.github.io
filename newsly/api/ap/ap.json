In a recorded video posted Wednesday on social media, Guthrie said her family is ready to talk. But she says they want proof that Nancy Guthrie, who authorities believe was taken from her home in Arizona against her will, is still alive. Guthrie says her family heard media reports about a ransom letter. Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday night and she was reported missing midday Sunday after she didn\u2019t appear at a church. Authorities on Wednesday offered no detailed update on their search. Their next news conference is scheduled for Thursday.",

      "description": "Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv are holding a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi to end their war. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power grid and after a rise in civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging allies to pressure Moscow to end the invasion, which began in 2022. He emphasizes the need for security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks. Fighting continues alongside the talks, with Russia targeting Ukraine\u2019s electricity network. Human Rights Watch reports a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties last year. Almost 15,000 civilians have been killed since the war began.",

      "description": "The Kremlin says it regretts the expiration of the last remaining nuclear arms pact between Russia and the United States, while President Donald Trump declared he was against keeping its limits and wants a better deal. The end of the New START treaty left no caps on the two largest atomic arsenals for the first time in more than a half-century, fueling fears of an unconstrained nuclear arms race. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed readiness to stick to the pact\u2019s limits for another year if Washington agreed. But Trump indicated he wants China to be a part of a new pact \u2014 something Beijing has rebuffed. The treaty, signed in 2010, was extended in 2021 for five more years.",

This comes after Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran in June and Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests. U.S. President Donald Trump has increased pressure on Iran and moved aircraft carriers to the Gulf, suggesting possible military action over the protests. Trump has also pushed Iran's nuclear program back into focus after the June war disrupted previous talks. Oman has mediated past talks between the two nations. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, but has been enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.",

President Trump first mentioned TrumpRx in September, highlighting deals with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices. The website's release faced delays, but it now showcases efforts to reduce costs through agreements with major companies like Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

Both sides accuse the other of violations, even as they continue to push ahead with the fragile process.

Four Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza in the same period, with more injured, including a soldier who was severely wounded overnight. Little progress has been made on larger issues concerning Gaza's future.",

The agency said Thursday that labels may now claim to have \u201cno artificial colors\u201d when they are free of petroleum-based dyes, even when they contain dyes made from natural sources such as plants. In the past, those claims could be made only when products had no added color whatsoever. The move is another step toward the Trump administration's aim to phase out synthetic dyes from the U.S. food supply. Limited evidence suggests artificial dyes may affect kids' behavior.",
