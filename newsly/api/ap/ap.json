      "description": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams says that a gunman who killed four people at a Manhattan office building was trying to target the headquarters of the National Football League but took the wrong elevator. Investigators believe Shane Tamura was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building\u2019s lobby but accidentally entered the wrong set of elevator banks, Adams said in interviews on Tuesday. Four people, including an off-duty New York City police officer, were killed. Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested he had a grievance against the NFL over an unsubstantiated claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed revoking a scientific finding that's long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. The proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule rescinds a 2009 declaration that determined carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health. The \u201cendangerment finding\u201d is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposed rule change on a podcast ahead of an official announcement set for Tuesday in Indiana. Three former EPA leaders say Zeldin's proposal would endanger the lives of millions of Americans.",

      "description": "The number of millionaires in the United States is soaring. A report from Swiss bank UBS finds about 1 in 10 American adults now has a net worth of at least $1 million, with 1,000 new millionaires added every day last year. That milestone, once reserved for celebrities and CEOs, is increasingly being reached by everyday Americans, thanks to rising home values, stock market gains and decades of retirement savings. With inflation, a million bucks no longer stretches as far as it once did, and many millionaires' wealth is tied up in houses and 401(k)s. But seven-figure status still holds symbolic weight. As one man who hit the mark put it, \u201cIt\u2019s not a golden ticket like it was in the past\" but it buys \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d",

For months, dietary supplement companies that sell kratom have been urging a crackdown on products containing the ingredient.

The amoeba entered his brain through his nose, possibly when he jumped into Lake Murray, near Columbia. A doctor delivered the diagnosis after Jaysen\u2019s headache and nausea worsened. He fought for a week before dying on July 18. Like many other states, South Carolina has no law requiring public reporting of such deaths. The lake remains open, with no water testing conducted.
