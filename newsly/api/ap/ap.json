      "description": "Israel has delayed a Cabinet vote on the long-awaited ceasefire deal that would pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip and release dozens of hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a last-minute dispute with Hamas is holding up Israeli approval. Hamas denied the claims. Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet vote on the agreement that had been scheduled for Thursday until Friday, at the earliest. Netanyahu signaled complications with the deal shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 72 people in the war-ravaged territory.",

      "description": "The Israel-Hamas war has devastated the Gaza Strip. Satellite photos offer some sense of the destruction in the territory. Some of the images have illustrated a likely buffer zone, wanted by Israel despite international objections. It would take some 60 square kilometers out of the enclave. In all, the strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea is about 360 square kilometers. Palestinians hope it will be part of a future state, along with the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Other images tell the story of how Palestinians\u2019 lives have changed during the war. Gaza City has been decimated, with buildings destroyed and roads filled with rubble. The images have also helped relief agencies and experts make estimates regarding the extent of the damage.",

He has promised to use the time before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated Monday to \u201ccontinue to review additional commutations and pardons.\u201d That could potentially include preemptive pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears could be unjustly targeted by Trump\u2019s administration.",

      "description": "A mysterious airstrip being built on a remote island in Yemen is nearing completion, according to satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press. The runway is likely built by the United Arab Emirates, which has long been suspected of expanding its military presence in the region and has backed a Saudi-led war against the Houthis. The construction comes as Yemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have continued their attacks on commercial shipping, U.S. warships and Israel over the war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Experts worry a ceasefire in Gaza may not be enough to see the Houthis halt a campaign that\u2019s drawn them global attention.",

The fire erupted Thursday afternoon, sending up towering flames and black smoke and showed no sign of easing by Thursday night. The Mercury News reported that 1,500 people have been instructed to leave Moss Landing and the Elkhorn Slough area. The Moss Landing Power Plant is about 77 miles south of San Francisco and is owned by Texas-company Vistra Energy. It contains tens of thousands of lithium batteries.",

Friday's meeting comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said earlier there were last minute snags in finalizing the agreement. However, a pre-dawn statement Friday by Israel\u2019s government, appeared to clear the way for Israeli approval for the deal.
