      "description": "Ukrainian officials say that Russia pounded the capital with yet another major missile and drone attack. At least least two people were killed in the attack overnight into Thursday. The strikes caused fires across Kyiv a day after the heaviest aerial attack of the war so far. An official in Kyiv said at least 16 people were wounded in the latest barrage. Russia has recently sought to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defenses with major attacks that include increasing numbers of decoy drones. The pressure has caused alarm among Ukrainian officials who are uncertain about continuing vital military aid from the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s policy toward Russia.",

      "description": "The Los Angeles Fire Department says 31 workers have been safely removed from an industrial tunnel after part of the structure collapsed. The workers were up to 6 miles from the tunnel\u2019s only entrance Wednesday. Some workers scrambled over a tall mound of loose soil to reach coworkers. They were shuttled to the entrance and hoisted out. Paramedics were evaluating 27 of the workers and officials say none had major injuries. A Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts spokesperson says authorities are still investigating the cause of the cave-in at the nearly $700 million project.",

The vigil was held Wednesday evening to remember of the at least 120 people who died in the catastrophic flash floods over the July Fourth holiday. More than 160 are still believed to be missing in hard-hit Kerr County. People in the crowd clutched one another and brushed away tears during the vigil. Search crews and volunteers are continuing to scour miles along the Guadalupe River for the people still missing. The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976.",

The countries targeted so far Wednesday are the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka. None of them is a major industrial rival to the United States. He says a letter is also coming for Brazil. Most economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth. But Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies.",

The assaults beginning over the weekend mark an escalation in their campaign tied to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Backed by Iran, the Houthis have long targeted shipping in the region, disrupting trade and causing significant losses. Experts say the recent attacks involved advanced tactics, including drones and missiles. Despite prior ceasefires and international airstrikes, the Houthis remain capable of carrying out such operations, raising concerns about escalating violence and instability in the region.",
