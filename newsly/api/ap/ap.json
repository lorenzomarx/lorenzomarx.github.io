      "description": "The Senate is slogging through an overnight session as Republican leaders search for ways to secure support for President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts. For almost 18 hours the Senate has been in what's called vote-a-rama, fending off proposed amendments mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota is working to strike a last-minute agreement between Republicans worried the bill\u2019s reductions to Medicaid will leave millions without care and his conservative flank seeking steeper cuts to hold down deficits ballooning with the tax cuts. Trump urged them on in a midnight social media post.",

      "description": "At some 887 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it\u2019s up to the Republican-controlled Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump\u2019s signature domestic policy package will become law. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. Now, it's the House's turn to consider. The bill would make permanent many of the tax breaks passed in Trump's first term while also adding new ones, such as no tax on tips or overtime.",

      "description": "Over 150 international charities and humanitarian groups are calling for disbanding a controversial Israeli- and U.S.-backed system to distribute aid in Gaza. That's because of chaos and deadly violence against Palestinians seeking food at sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. At least 10 Palestinians were killed Tuesday while seeking aid in southern and central Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he plans to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump next week in Washington. Trump has signaled that he is ready for Israel and Hamas to wind down the war in Gaza.",

The munitions were previously promised to Ukraine for use during its ongoing war with Russia under the Biden administration. But the pause reflects a new set of priorities under President Donald Trump. The Pentagon review determined that stocks were too low on some items previously pledged, so pending shipments of some items won\u2019t be sent, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide information that has not yet been made public.",

Trump is heading there on Tuesday for a firsthand look at a facility the White House suggests will be especially secure given its dangerous natural surroundings.
