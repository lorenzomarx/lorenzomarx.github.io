      "description": "The Trump administration has released records of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate\u2019s family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination. The release involves an estimated 200,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977. King\u2019s family, including his two living children, Martin III and Bernice, were given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure. The release is part of President Donald Trump\u2019s order to publicly disclose government files on King and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.",

      "description": "The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland. Russia now batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024. Analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record. Some experts say that could soon reach 1,000 a day. This comes amid a U.S. ultimatum for Russia to reach a ceasefire by Sept. 2 or face tough sanctions -\u2013 a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible.",

Brett Hankison, who fired 10 shots during the raid but didn\u2019t hit anyone, was the only officer on the scene charged in the Black woman's death. He is the first person sentenced to prison in the case that rocked the city of Louisville and spawned weeks of street protests over police brutality five years ago.

The university accuses the government of using funding as leverage to control its academic decisions. The cuts followed Harvard's rejection of demands from a federal antisemitism task force. The task force wanted sweeping changes to Harvard's policies on campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard, with a $53 billion endowment, has self-funded some research but warns it can't cover all losses. The Trump administration denies retaliation, stating the cuts align with its policies.",
