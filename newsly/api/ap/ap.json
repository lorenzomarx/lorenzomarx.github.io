      "description": "Palestinian health officials say Israeli strikes overnight and into Sunday killed 10 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children. Two of the strikes hit tents in the southern city of Khan Younis, each killing two children and their parents. Other strikes killed a child and a man riding a bicycle, according to Nasser Hospital, which received bodies from all the strikes. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths in the 19-month-old war because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the latest strikes.",

From U.S. Catholics to the left of the ideological center, there's optimism that Leo will carry on Pope Francis\u2019 outreach to poor and marginalized people, including migrants. They also hope he'll provide a counterweight to the policies of the Trump administration that distress them. To the right, there's hope the new pope will faithfully uphold Catholic doctrine, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and women\u2019s ordination.",

Without clear details on how it will work, skeptics worry it could be a giveaway for developers and mining companies. For some rapidly growing western cities, owning the adjacent federal land would be a boon. Conservationists, on the other hand, fear the loss of public lands and environmental destruction. And while housing advocates are hopeful at the opportunity, they remain wary that enough affordable housing will be built. The legislation passed by the House Natural Resources Committee last week, part of the Republicans\u2019 sweeping tax cut package.",

      "description": "The United States is pulling back from its role in spreading democratic ideals abroad under President Donald Trump. Experts are raising concerns about the effect on movements that aim to counter authoritarians and build the foundations for representative government. The Trump administration has tried to shutter the U.S. Agency for Global Media, ended a U.S. Agency for International Development democracy initiative and restructured the State Department to eliminate a key global democracy office. It's a departure from America's long role in spreading democracy across the world. Experts say Washington's gutting of such initiatives could accelerate what many see as a trend of democratic backsliding around the globe.",
