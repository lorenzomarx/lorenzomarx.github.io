      "description": "President Donald Trump, in a new interview, is circumspect about his duties to uphold due process rights laid out in the Constitution. He also says he doesn\u2019t think military force would be needed to make Canada the \u201c51st state.\u201d And he's downplaying the possibility that he'd look to run for a third term in the White House. The comments came in a wide-ranging and at time combative interview with Kristen Walker that aired Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\" The Republican president\u2019s efforts to quickly enact his agenda are beginning to face sharper headwinds just as his administration crossed the 100-day mark this past week.",

      "description": "Top Israeli Cabinet ministers are set to meet to vote on whether to intensify the country\u2019s military operations in the Gaza Strip, as the country's main airport was closed following a missile launched from Yemen. The army has begun to call up thousands of reserve soldiers in preparation for an expanded assault, Israeli officials said Sunday. The plans to escalate fighting in Gaza more than 18 months after the war there erupted come as a humanitarian crisis in the territory deepens. Houthi rebels on Sunday launched a missile that set off air raid sirens in many parts of the country. A large plume of smoke could be seen rising near Ben-Gurion Airport, according to footage shared by Israeli media.",

      "description": "It felt much longer, but the U.S. stock market needed just a few weeks to roar all the way back to where it was on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d That\u2019s when he shocked Wall Street by announcing much steeper tariffs than expected on nearly all U.S. trading partners. Within just four days, the S&P 500 fell about 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 4,600 points, or about 11%. This past Friday, though, the S&P 500 rallied for a ninth straight gain and pulled back to where it was on April 2. Trump's 90-day pause on many tariffs and a resilient economy helped the market bounce back.",

Eleven candidates are vying for the presidency and a May 18 runoff is expected.

      "description": "Democrats are looking for the right message and messengers to lead the opposition to President Donald Trump in his second term. And two vastly different politicians are emerging as top Democratic voices. They are Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York congresswoman. Both have drawn praise for high-profile speeches and events that have excited voters on the left. Pritzker is a billionaire heir who calls Trump as a threat to democracy and national stability. Ocasio-Cortez maintains her antiestablishment profile and labels Trump a corrupt billionaire who's hurting the working class he says he represents. Their messages highlight a familiar argument among Democrats' progressive and more moderate factions.",
