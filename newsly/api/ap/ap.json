      "description": "A planned news conference after talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine envoy has been canceled. The cancellation happened Thursday as political tensions deepen between the two countries over how to end the almost three-year war with Russia. The press event was to include comments to the media by Zelenskyy and retired U.S. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg. But it was changed at the last minute so that the two politicians did not deliver statements or field questions from journalists. Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nikiforov said the change was requested by the U.S. side. Kellogg\u2019s trip to Kyiv coincided with recent feuding between Trump and Zelenskyy.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives. His comments caused outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger Russian military. Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201ca dictator without elections\u201d and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from Russia, and some of what Trump has said does echo Russia\u2019s own narrative of the conflict.",

      "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine three years ago has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Tens of thousands have been killed, cities have been reduced to ruins, millions of Ukrainians became refugees, and Russia was isolated from the West. Now as top Russian and U.S. officials are talking again and setting the stage for summit meeting, Putin appears closer than ever to cementing Moscow\u2019s gains of about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory and keeping the country out of NATO. President Donald Trump reversed the U.S. policy of isolating Russia, saying they have agreed \u201cto work together very closely\u201d to end the war. He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwill be involved\u201d but didn\u2019t elaborate.",

The rhetoric from Trump toward Ukraine comes amid an escalating back-and-forth between the two presidents and rising tensions between the United States and much of Europe over Trump\u2019s approach to settling the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II. Trump\u2019s broadside came not long after Zelenskyy\u2019s comment that Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he tries to bring the fighting to a close on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow.",

The Zapad, or West, 2025 drills will involve over 13,000 troops. That's according to Valery Revenko, an assistant to the Belarusian defense minister. Belarus\u2019 authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for over 30 years and has relied on Kremlin subsidies and support, allowed Russia to use his country\u2019s territory to send troops into neighboring Ukraine in 2022 and to host some of its tactical nuclear weapons.",

Two boys and their mother were abducted from a kibbutz on Oct. 7, 2023, and became a symbol of the country\u2019s anguish. Hamas had claimed the family was killed in an Israeli airstrike, but their fate remained unclear for months. The father was freed earlier this month in a ceasefire deal. Images of the red-haired children circulated widely and their ordeal fueled calls for the release of all the hostages taken by Hamas. The remains will now be formally identified.",

      "description": "German voters go to the polls Sunday to elect a parliament that will determine who runs the country for the next four years. Germany has Europe\u2019s biggest economy and is the EU\u2019s most populous nation. It is a leading member of NATO and the second-biggest weapons supplier to Ukraine. The vote count is likely to be final early Monday, but it's not clear what governing coalitions are possible. Preelection polling shows a mainstream conservative bloc with about 30% support and the far-right Alternative for Germany with around 20%. Parties need to get 5% of the vote to win seats, so how many reach that threshold may determine the coalition's makeup. All mainstream parties say they won\u2019t work with AfD.",

Experts express concern about increasingly provocative coverage as traditional media compete with YouTube channels and other social media sources for clicks, further dimming the prospects for reforms. Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for other acting roles. But she was condemned and ridiculed for many aspects of her life after a drunken-driving crash in 2022.",
