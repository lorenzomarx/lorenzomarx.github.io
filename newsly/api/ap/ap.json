      "description": "Six Iranians spoke to The Associated Press about the protests in Iran, describing a renewed sense of hope even with a bloody crackdown on demonstrators. The Iranians said they demonstrated and witnessed state violence. Protests erupt in Iran every few years, but several said this time felt different, with unprecedented momentum and a diverse crowd. They described older residents, people from well-to-do families, even children on the streets. Activists estimate over 6,000 people were killed in the bloodiest crackdown on dissent since the Islamic Republic's 1979 creation. The Iranians spoke on condition of anonymity as the crackdown continued. Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations did not respond to questions from AP about these witnesses\u2019 recollections.",

      "description": "Ukraine is waiting to see if Russia will pause attacks on its power grid. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a temporary halt as Ukraine faces severe winter weather. Trump didn't specify when the call with Putin happened or when the moratorium would start. The Kremlin hasn't confirmed the pause. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doubts Russia's intentions. Kyiv is experiencing power shortages and expects extreme cold. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is ready to stop its attacks if Russia does the same. But there's no official ceasefire agreement. Zelenskyy said Thursday in comments made public on Friday that \u201cI do not believe that Russia wants to end the war.\"",

      "description": "Another wave of dangerous cold is heading for the U.S. South, and experts say the risk of hypothermia heightens for people in parts of Mississippi and Tennessee who are entering their sixth day trapped at home without power in subfreezing temperatures. The National Weather Service says arctic air moving into the Southeast will cause already frigid temperatures to plummet into the teens on Friday night in cities like Nashville. Doctors say while more vulnerable people may have started experiencing hypothermia symptoms within hours of being exposed to the frigid temperatures, younger people who are generally healthy may soon start falling victim to these effects as well.",

      "description": "Senate leaders were scrambling to save a bipartisan spending deal and avert a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday as Democrats have demanded new restrictions on federal immigration raids across the country. Democrats struck a rare deal with President Donald Trump Thursday to separate funding for the Homeland Security Department from a broad government spending bill and fund it for two weeks while Congress debates curbs on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The deal came as irate Democrats had vowed to vote against the entire spending bill and trigger a shutdown in the wake of the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis.",
