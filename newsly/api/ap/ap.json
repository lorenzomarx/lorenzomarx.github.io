      "description": "Forced leaves have begun in Washington and worldwide for most employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Under a Trump administration plan, the agency is to be left with fewer than 300 workers out of many thousands. The leaves at USAID started Friday. Federal workers associations have turned to the courts to try to roll back orders dismantling most of the agency and U.S.- funded aid programs around the world. It's not clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what Trump administration says is a review of the aid and development programs it wants to resume.",

The memo was sent Thursday as the administration seeks to shrink the workforce and awaits a court ruling related to its deferred resignation offers. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management directs the agencies to submit names of every employee who has received less than a \u201cfully successful\u201d performance rating in the past three years and to note whether the workers have been on performance plans. That data is due March 7.",

Israel is to release 183 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday to fulfill its side of the agreement, according to the Hamas-linked prisoners\u2019 office in Gaza.
