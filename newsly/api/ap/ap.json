      "description": "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is cutting short his official trip to South Africa and returning home after a Russian strike on Kyiv killed at least nine people and injured more than 70. The Russian attack on Kyiv came hours after weeks of peace negotiations appeared to be coming to a head without an agreement in sight. President Donald Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy on Wednesday, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by refusing to surrender the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula as part of a possible peace deal. Zelenskyy has repeated many times during the more than three-year war that recognizing occupied territory as Russian is a red line for his country.",

      "description": "Tensions between arch rivals India and Pakistan were high on Thursday as New Delhi mounted a diplomatic offensive against Islamabad, blaming it for a deadly attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in disputed Kashmir. India accused Islamabad of supporting \u201ccross-border terrorism\u201d Wednesday night and imposed diplomatic measures, including downgrading diplomatic ties, suspending of a key water-sharing treaty and closing the main land border crossing with Pakistan. Pakistan has denied the accusation and a previously unknown militant group calling itself Kashmir Resistance has claimed responsibility for the attack. Islamabad said it would respond to India\u2019s actions on Thursday and convene its National Security Committee, which is composed of senior civil and military officials.",

On Wednesday, more than 19,000 people paid their respects in the first 8 1/2 hours of the viewing at St. Peter's Basilica. Mourners from across the globe made a slow, shuffling procession up the main aisle of the basilica to pay their last respects to Francis, the Argentine pontiff remembered for creating a climate of inclusion.",

      "description": "The papacy of Pope Francis ended with the same core doctrine for LGBTQ+ people that he had inherited. The Catholic Church still rejected same-sex marriage and condemned any sexual relations between gay or lesbian partners as \u201cintrinsically disordered.\u201d Yet unlike his predecessors, Francis incrementally conveyed through his actions, formal statements and occasional casual remarks that he wanted the church to be a more welcoming place for LGBTQ+ people. Among activists, there was some frustration over the lack of a doctrinal breakthrough, but they still expressed gratitude for his warmth toward them. It was clear early in his papacy that Francis would articulate a gentler, more tolerant approach to LGBTQ+ people than any previous pope.",
