      "description": "U.S. and Chinese officials say they have reached a deal to roll back most of their recent tariffs and call a 90 day pause so they can keep talking to resolve their trade disputes. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Monday the U.S. has agreed to drop its 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods by 115 percentage points to 30%, while China has agreed to lower its rate on U.S. goods by the same amount to 10%. Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the tariff reductions at a news conference in Geneva. They say the two sides have set up consultations to continue discussing their trade issues. The announcement by the U.S. and China sent shares surging.",

A joint statement said the U.S. would cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from as high as 145%. China said its tariffs on U.S. goods would fall to 10% from 125%. U.S. futures gained more than 2% early Monday and shares in Asia and Europe also jumped. The agreement to talk followed two days of meetings in Geneva, Switzerland.

In a statement, Hamas did not immediately disclose further details about the release expected on Monday. Hamas had announced on Sunday that it would free Edan Alexander as a good will gesture for the Trump administration. Alexander, an Israeli soldier, was taken captive on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli authorities earlier acknowledged Alexander's planned release, without saying when it would happen. It would be the first hostage release since Israel shattered an 8-week ceasefire with Hamas.",

Prosecutors and the defense started summarizing their cases Monday shortly after the 12 regular jurors and six alternates were picked. Federal prosecutors will try to prove that Combs turned his hip-hop conglomerate into a racketeering enterprise that forced women to satisfy his sexual desires. Combs has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say prosecutors are wrongly trying to make a crime out of a party-loving lifestyle that may have been indulgent but was not illegal. Combs could get at least 15 years in prison if he is convicted on all charges.",

The Kremlin has effectively rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the more than three-year war. But Moscow reiterated that it would take part in possible peace talks later this week without preconditions. There was no direct response from the Kremlin on Monday to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s challenge for Russian leader Vladimir Putin to meet him for face-to-face peace talks in Turkey on Thursday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday refused to say who might travel to Istanbul from the Russian side.

If a deal is not reached, a new rule will kick in tying the price of what the U.S. pays for medications to lower prices paid by other countries.
