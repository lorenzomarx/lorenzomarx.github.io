      "description": "The world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has been ordered to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East. That's according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity. It comes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers whether to take possible military action against Iran. The move, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region as Trump increases pressure on Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program.",

      "description": "Dubai has named a new chairman for DP World, one of the world\u2019s largest logistics companies, replacing a chairman named in the Jeffrey Epstein files. The announcement by the government\u2019s Dubai Media Office did not specifically name Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. However, it said that Essa Kazim was named DP World\u2019s chairman and Yuvraj Narayan was named group CEO. Those were positions held by Sulayem. DP World has long been a pillar of the economy of the Middle Eastern city. Newly released emails showed a yearslong friendship between Sulayem, and Epstein. Some emails referenced porn, sexual massages and escorts.",

      "description": "The fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein saga is rippling through Europe. Politicians, diplomats, officials and royals have seen reputations tarnished, investigations launched and jobs lost. It comes after a trove of more than 3 million pages of Epstein-related documents revealed their ties to the U.S. financier and convicted sex offender who died behind bars in 2019. Some experts note that the reckoning in Europe\u2019s parliamentary democracies has been swifter and more severe for now than in the United States where Epstein built his empire and hobnobbed with many American elites.",

Funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire Saturday as lawmakers debate new restrictions on President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda. The White House has been negotiating with the Democrats, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the deadline. Unlike the record 43-day shutdown last fall, the closures will be narrowly confined, as only agencies that are part of Homeland Security will be affected. Still some federal workers could begin to miss paychecks and services like airport screening could be affected if the shutdown drags on for weeks.",

The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Minnesota said in a filing Thursday that newly discovered evidence in the case against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis is materially inconsistent with the allegations against them. The government\u2019s motion asked the judge for dismissal with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be resubmitted. The pending dismissal comes after a string of high-profile shootings involving federal immigration agents have seen claims made by federal officers called into question.",

      "description": "A new AP-NORC poll finds that Trump's recent push to seize control of Greenland is divisive even within his own party. The survey finds that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. That\u2019s higher than the share who dislike how he\u2019s handling foreign policy generally, suggesting that Trump\u2019s Greenland approach has created a particular weak spot for the administration. Even Republicans aren\u2019t thrilled. About half don\u2019t like his attempt to turn the icebound landmass into American territory, something that Trump has insisted is critical for national security in the Arctic.",

The increase in such a broad range of costs has become a high-profile political issue under the rubric of \u201caffordability.\u201d",
