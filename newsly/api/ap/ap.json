      "description": "The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson has died. He was 84. Jackson was a protege of the Rev. Martin Luther King and became a leader of the Civil Rights Movement for decades after King was assassinated in 1968. A two-time presidential candidate, Jackson led a lifetime of political crusades, advocating for the poor and underrepresented on issues from voting rights and job opportunities to education and health care. He scored diplomatic victories with world leaders and channeled cries for Black pride and self-determination into corporate boardrooms, using his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition to pressure executives to make America a more open and equitable society.",

      "description": "In 1983, The Associated Press profiled the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he was a 41-year civil rights activist preparing his historic 1984 campaign for the presidency. Jackson at the time described himself much like a prophet \u2014 driven by his religion to rise, like Jesus, Gandhi or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In the \u201960s, he battled for equal rights, picketing restaurants and marching for open housing. In the \u201970s he stressed self-respect and economic justice. In the '80s, he turned to leadership, making a run for president. Friends and foes described him similarly \u2014 his ego, his drive, his grand ideas, his weakness as an organizer, and his clever courting of the media.",

      "description": "The U.S. and Iran are expected to hold a second round of talks in Geneva about Iran\u2019s nuclear program as tensions rise in the region. The session, planned for Tuesday, comes after a first round of indirect talks held in Oman earlier in the month. They are being held as the U.S. ramps up its military presence in the region amid threats by President Donald Trump to use force to push a deal. Iran also began major Revolutionary Guard naval drills near key oil shipping routes. Still, both sides are signaling they are willing to reach a deal, which Iran says must include easing U.S.-led sanctions.",

The regulator says Grok has created and shared sexualized images of real people, including children. Researchers say some examples appear to involve minors.

That includes Spain, which has has ordered prosecutors to investigate X, Meta and TikTok for alleged crimes related to AI-generated child sex abuse materials on their platforms.",

The order came on Presidents Day, the federal holiday honoring Washington\u2019s legacy. The city of Philadelphia sued last month after the National Park Service removed the panels from Independence National Historical Park. The removal followed a Trump executive order on \u201crestoring truth and sanity to American history\u201d at the nation\u2019s museums, parks and landmarks. U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe said all materials must be restored while a lawsuit challenging the removal\u2019s legality plays out.",

They link that decision to the four deaths at Apalachee High School. Investigators say the 14-year-old planned the attack and brought a rifle in his backpack. Gray's attorney says his client wasn't told about the planning and timing of the shooting and shouldn't be held criminally responsible The trial is being held in Winder, where the shooting happened, with jurors from nearby Hall County.",
