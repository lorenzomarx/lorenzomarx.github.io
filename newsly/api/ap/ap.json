      "description": "President Donald Trump says he\u2019s directing the opening of a detention center at Guantanamo Bay to hold up to 30,000 migrants who are living illegally in the United States. Trump made the announcement Wednesday right before he signed the Laken Riley Act into law as his administration\u2019s first piece of legislation. The bipartisan measure means that people who are in the United States illegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes would have to be detained and potentially deported even before a conviction.",

The Laken Riley Act will require the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Under the law signed Wednesday, federal officials will be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes like shoplifting, assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone.",

      "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is pulling the security protections and clearance of retired Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Mark Milley. He also ordered the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general to review Milley\u2019s actions while serving as the nation\u2019s top uniformed officer to determine if a demotion is warranted, two defense officials confirmed late Tuesday. Milley served as chairman during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office. While the relationship initially went well, it soured deeply and fast, as Milley tried to advise and contain the president on a host of issues. Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff Joe Kasper said that the decision to strip Milley of his clearance and detail was taken because \u201cundermining the chain of command is corrosive to our national security.\"",

      "description": "When disaster strikes, government emergency alert systems offer a simple promise: Residents will get information about nearby dangers and instructions to help them stay safe. As the deadly LA wildfires and other major disasters have shown, alerts rely on a complicated chain of communication between first responders, government administrators, third-party companies and the public. Sometimes, the chain breaks. In this month's wind-driven wildfires in Southern California, evacuation alerts for some neighborhoods came long after homes were aflame. That included the part of Altadena where most of the deaths occurred. County officials have approved an outside review of its role in the Eaton Fire and Palisades Fire alerts at the urging of residents.",

Cases have doubled in the past three years, impacting more than 3,000 seafarers across some 230 ships, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.N. data. Photos and videos taken on one such ship moored off the coast of Yemen show the faucets spewing cloudy brown water, rust blanketing the deck and only a few rotting pieces of produce in the pantry. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially imprisoned on these vessels,\u201d one ship inspector said. \u201cIt goes way beyond exploitation.\u201d",

The White House confirmed that OMB pulled the order Wednesday in a two sentence notice to agencies and departments, but said that Trump\u2019s underlying executive orders targeting federal spending in areas like diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change, remained in place. The Monday evening order from the White House Office of Management and Budget sparked uncertainty over a crucial financial lifeline for states, schools and organizations that rely on trillions of dollars from Washington and left the White House scrambling to explain what would and wouldn\u2019t be subject to a pause in funding.",

Police said 60 others were injured Wednesday. It was a sacred day in the six-week Hindu festival, and authorities expected a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. Hindus believe that a dip there can cleanse them of past sins and end the process of reincarnation.",
