The report offered few other details about what happened to Gen. Hossein Salami of the Guard. The report on air added that one other top Guard officials, as well as two nuclear scientists were also feared dead. State television also reported the attack set the headquarters of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard ablaze. Multiple sites in the capital had been hit in the attack, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said targeted both nuclear and military sites and officials leading Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its ballistic missile arsenal.",

      "description": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is promising to move forward with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles despite the waves of unrest. Noem spoke Thursday, hours before a judge directed the president to return control to California over National Guard troops he deployed after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals quickly put the brakes on that and temporarily blocked the judge's order, which was to go into effect on Friday. The judge\u2019s order said the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded President Donald Trump\u2019s statutory authority.",

The judge in Massachusetts on Friday sided with the Democratic state attorneys general, who called the Republican president's executive order overreach. Trump's order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections and accept mailed ballots only if received by Election Day. The attorneys general say Trump's order was unconstitutional. The White House has defended Trump's order as \u201cstanding up for free, fair and honest elections.\" The judge says the Constitution doesn't grant the president any specific powers over elections.",

The highly divisive case has hinged on the prosecution's theory of jaded love turned deadly.

Read is accused of fatally striking her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow outside a house party where other local police and a federal agent were closing out a night of drinking in 2022.
