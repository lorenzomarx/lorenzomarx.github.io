      "description": "A federal judge in New Hampshire says he will certify a class action lawsuit including all children who will be affected by President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship and issue a preliminary injunction blocking it. The judge announced his decision Thursday after an hour-long hearing and said a written order will follow. He says the order will include a seven-day stay to allow for appeal. Plaintiffs originally sought to include parents as plaintiffs.",

      "description": "A federal judge in New Hampshire has blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The ruling, issued Thursday, prohibits the order from taking effect nationwide but allows a seven-day stay for appeal. Birthright citizenship, rooted in the 14th Amendment, grants U.S. citizenship to anyone born on American soil, regardless of their parents' legal status. Trump\u2019s order, signed in January, challenges this principle, calling it a \u201cmagnet for illegal immigration.\u201d Legal battles over the order are ongoing, with experts predicting the case will reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The issue could have significant implications for immigration and constitutional law.",

      "description": "Several hundred people have gathered for a worship ceremony at a high school stadium in Texas. The vigil was held Wednesday evening to remember of the at least 120 people who died in the catastrophic flash floods over the July Fourth holiday. More than 160 are still believed to be missing in hard-hit Kerr County. People in the crowd clutched one another and brushed away tears during the vigil. Search crews and volunteers are continuing to scour miles along the Guadalupe River for the people still missing. The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976.",

Jane Towler says she got a call at around 4 a.m. last Friday from a friend in a neighboring cabin telling her the Guadalupe River was rising quickly and to get to safety. Towler ran next door to warn her son, their family friend and the woman's young daughter. Videos Towler shot show how quickly the cottage filled with water and how they had to flee to the attic and then the roof, where they waited out the night amid lightning, shouts and widespread destruction.",

The workers were up to 6 miles from the tunnel\u2019s only entrance Wednesday. Some workers scrambled over a tall mound of loose soil to reach coworkers.

The move is part of a broad effort to limit access to federal benefits for immigrants who lack legal status. People in the country illegally are largely ineligible for federal public benefits such as food stamps, student loans and financial aid for higher education. But for decades they have been able to access some community-level programs such as Head Start and community health centers. The changes were announced Thursday by the Health and Human Services department.",

His lawyers filed a claim Thursday, alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution after his March arrest by federal agents. Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, said he suffered severe anguish in jail, and continues to fear for his safety. The government has accused him of leading protests aligned with Hamas, but has not provided any evidence of a link to the terror group.",

Kellogg was founded in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1906. It makes Froot Loops, Special K, Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies. Kellogg has been struggling with falling U.S. cereal consumption as consumers opt for protein bars and other products. But industry watchers say its large distribution network and relations with grocers are appealing to Ferrero. The deal still needs the approval of WK Kellogg's shareholders.",
