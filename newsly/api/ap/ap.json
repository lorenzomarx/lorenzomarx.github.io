      "description": "Job-seekers hoping to join the new Trump administration are facing a series of intense loyalty tests. And White House screening teams are fanning out to government agencies and carefully going through applicants\u2019 politics and social media posts. President Donald Trump believed the biggest mistake he made during his first term was hiring what he considered to be the wrong kinds of people. Now, aides are working to ensure the government is filled only with loyalists. Negative social media posts have been enough to derail applications. Job-seekers have been told they'll have to prove their \u201centhusiasm\u201d to implement Trump\u2019s agenda and they've been asked when their moment of \u201cMAGA revelation\u201d occurred.",

      "description": "The Trump administration has fired about 17 independent inspectors general at federal agencies. The action removes oversight of his new administration, and some members of Congress are suggesting the dismissals violate federal oversight laws. The dismissals began Friday night and were effective immediately. That's according to two people familiar with the actions who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that haven't been made public. Congress was not given 30-day notices about the removals. And that's something that even a top Republican is decrying. Trump has used his first week back in office to institute a sweeping shakeup of the federal government.",

      "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office isn\u2019t over yet, but what the Republican president has done so far offers clues about how his next four years in the White House may unfold. The early days of Trump's second term indicate that Trump is still Trump, but he seems emboldened like never before. He\u2019s much more organized this time around. And he's betting he can fix everything. Trump doesn't have to worry about reelection. The Supreme Court has now granted presidents expansive immunity. And Trump is backed by a Republican Congress. So there's little to restrain him today.",

      "description": "The U.S. Air Force has removed training courses for service members that included historical videos of its storied Black Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs \u2014 female World War II pilots. The step was to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s DEI ban. The videos were shown to new enlisted troops as part of the diversity courses they took in basic training. The problem may not be with the videos themselves, but that they were used in DEI coursework. The lack of clearer guidance has led the Air Force and other agencies to take a broad approach to content they are removing from training.",

Israel later released 200 Palestinian prisoners Saturday in the second exchange of a fragile ceasefire. Hamas again sought to show it remained in control in Gaza after 15 months of war. In the ceasefire's first major crisis, Israel said it would not allow displaced Palestinians to begin returning to northern Gaza as had been expected by Sunday. It said a civilian hostage meant to be released, Arbel Yehoud, had not been freed.",

The activity Saturday comes a day before the deadline for it to withdraw from the area under an agreement that halted Israel's war with the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military, meanwhile, has confirmed that it will not complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon by Sunday as outlined in the ceasefire agreement. The deal that went into effect in late November gave both sides 60 days to remove their forces from southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese army to move in and secure the area, along with U.N. peacekeepers.",
