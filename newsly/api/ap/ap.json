      "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs is planning an \u201caggressive\u201d reorganization that includes cutting 80,000 jobs from the sprawling agency that provides health care for retired military members. That's according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. The VA\u2019s chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, told top level officials at the agency that it had an objective to cut enough employees to return to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000. That would require terminating tens of thousands of employees after the VA expanded under the Biden administration, as well as to cover veterans impacted by burn pits under the 2022 PACT Act.",

      "description": "A handful of veterans speaking to The Associated Press are divided over the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Stephen Watson is a former Marine who lives in Jesup, Georgia. Watson says everyone, including veterans, needs to share in the sacrifice to bring the nation's spending under control. But former Marine Gregg Bafundo, of Tonasket, Washington, disagrees. Bafundo says President Donald Trump's cuts are only about \u201churting people and breaking things.\u201d The Republican administration's plans to cut $2 billion in VA contracts are currently on pause. That's because of concerns that critical health services for veterans would be harmed.",

The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the Biden administration lawsuit in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care. The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country\u2019s strictest abortion bans. The state argues that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions.",
