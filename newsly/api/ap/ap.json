      "description": "The deadline for the start of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip has passed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Hamas had not lived up to its commitment to provide the names of the three hostages it was set to release later on Sunday in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the top Israeli military spokesman, said the army \u201ccontinues to attack\u201d and would until Hamas complies with the agreement. Hamas blamed the delay in handing over the names on \u201ctechnical field reasons.\u201d An Israeli official said mediators have provided assurances that the list will be delivered and the deal is still expected to go forward, though the timing remains in question.",

      "description": "Even before the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was fully in place, Palestinians in the war-battered Gaza Strip began to return to the remains of the homes they had evacuated during the 15-month war. They trekked through the wreckage, some on foot and others hauling their belongings on donkey carts. The return of the families comes amid looming uncertainty about whether the ceasefire deal will bring more than a temporary halt to the fighting, who will govern the enclave and how it will be rebuilt. The United Nations has said that reconstruction could take more than 350 years if Gaza remains under an Israeli blockade.",

      "description": "Three hostages held by Hamas have been released after 471 days in captivity as part of a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. Their release on Sunday will be followed by that of dozens of other captives over the next several weeks under the ceasefire agreement. The truce has sparked hope and trepidation among Israelis. Many fear that the three-phase deal could collapse before all the hostages return, or that they will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is more than predicted.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal. The resignation of Itamar Ben-Gvir does not threaten the ceasefire, but it does weaken Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition. If other far-right lawmakers leave the government \u2014 as Ben-Gvir has encouraged them to do \u2014 the prime minister could lose his parliamentary majority, potentially forcing early elections. Ben-Gvir opposed the deal because it requires Israel to free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and to withdraw troops from Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt \u2014 and because it leaves open the possibility of Hamas staying in power in Gaza.",

      "description": "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app\u2019s savior. The developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",
