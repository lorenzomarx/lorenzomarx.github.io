      "description": "Israel and Iran have struck at one another again a week into their war as President Donald Trump weighs U.S. involvement and new diplomatic efforts appear to be taking place. Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi appeared to be heading to Geneva on Friday for meetings with diplomats from the European Union, United Kingdom, France and Germany. Trump has been weighing whether to attack Iran by striking a uranium enrichment facility so deeply buried it is considered safe from all but America\u2019s \u201cbunker-buster\u201d bombs.",

      "description": "Authorities in southern Mexico were still assessing damage and watching rising rivers as rain from the remnants of Hurricane Erick doused the region. Authorities reported landslides, blocked highways, downed power lines and some flooding. At least one death was confirmed late Thursday, a 1-year-old boy who drowned in a swollen river. Acapulco residents and remaining tourists emerged to walk outside or visit the few open businesses as the remnants of Hurricane Erick scraped by just inland of the resort.",

      "description": "Amena Namjoyan arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos as part of a migration crisis that would rock the European Union. She spent months in an overcrowded camp. She struggled with illness and depression. She moved to Germany but eventually returned to Lesbos. She works at a restaurant, preparing Iranian dishes that locals devour. Islanders say this is part of Lesbos' legacy, helping outsiders in need. The migration crisis peaked from 2015 to 2016, and 10 years later the fallout still reverberates on the island and beyond. Migration policy in Europe has shifted toward deterrence. Far fewer people are arriving illegally. Officials and politicians maintain that strong borders are needed. Critics say enforcement has gone too far and violates fundamental EU values.",

And now the monthly cash transfers to buy proteins and vegetables to supplement them are gone. Funding for the U.N. World Food Program has dropped after the Trump administration paused support in March. It's part of the widespread dismantling of foreign aid by the United States, once the world\u2019s biggest donor. Some refugees are surviving on one meal a day. Some malnourished babies arrive too late at a local hospital and die within hours. Workers fear they will see more.",

The vote Friday could be one of the most consequential social decisions they will ever make. It's potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was legalized in 1967. Members of Parliament approved assisted dying when they first debated the issue in November by a 330-275 vote. It since has undergone months of scrutiny leading to some changes in the proposed legislation that has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",

He even claimed once to have made Juneteenth \u201cvery famous.\u201d But on this year's Juneteenth holiday on Thursday, Trump kept silent about a day important to Black Americans for marking the end of slavery in the country he leads again.

She declined to say whether Trump would recognize the occasion another way or on another day.",

Thursday\u2019s decision halts a ruling from a lower court judge who found Trump acted illegally by activating the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The deployment was the first by a president of a state National Guard without the governor\u2019s permission since 1965 and the court case could have wider implications on the president\u2019s power to deploy soldiers within the United States. Trump argued the troops were necessary to restore order, but Newsom said the move inflamed tensions and usurped local authority.",

      "description": "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don\u2019t support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips. They say it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid. The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president\u2019s spending bill. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible. For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday.",
