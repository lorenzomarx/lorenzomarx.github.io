      "description": "Switzerland is home to some of the world\u2019s most recognizable luxury brands. It now faces a 39% tariff as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. Industry groups warned that both Swiss companies and American consumers could pay the price. Swiss officials failed to reach an agreement with the U.S. after Trump initially threatened a 31% tariff in April. The Swiss government spent Friday reeling from the news. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Switzerland was $38.5 billion last year. That's according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.",

      "description": "American businesses and consumers are finding the contours of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign trade agenda taking shape. But they don't have much more clarity on how import taxes on goods from dozens of countries will affect them. Late Thursday, Trump ordered new tariff rates for 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. Trump postponed the start date for all of the tariffs from Friday until Aug. 7. Companies are dealing with tariffs in various ways, from absorbing the tax costs themselves to raising prices. Economist say U.S. consumers are likely to foot at least part of the bill.",

All four of the group\u2019s distribution sites are in zones controlled by the Israeli military and have become flashpoints of desperation. Hundreds have been killed by gunfire or trampling.

This decision comes as the White House presses for a more positive view of American history. A label about impeachment was added in 2021 to the National Museum for American History's exhibit on presidential power. Smithsonian spokesperson Phillip Zimmerman said the section needed an overhaul. Trump is the only president impeached twice, in 2019 and 2021. Zimmerman says the impeachment reference will be restored after revisions. Since January, Trump has demanded changes across Washington cultural institutions, including the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, and the Kennedy Center.",
