      "description": "China has moved to curb a fierce price war between automakers sector that has caused massive losses for the industry. China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation released new guidelines Thursday to prevent manufacturers from pricing cars too cheaply in order to squeeze out rivals. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported this week that domestic passenger car sales fell 20% in January from a year earlier. Analysts say a cut in tax exemptions for electric vehicles and weaker EV subsidies in several Chinese regions have dampened demand. As domestic car demand slows, Chinese carmakers are expanding their global sales, and exports are expected to grow this year.",

      "description": "South Korea\u2019s spy agency says it believes the teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is close to being designated as the country\u2019s future leader. The assessment comes as Kim moves to extend the family dynasty to a fourth generation. The assessment by the National Intelligence Service was delivered to lawmakers in a closed-door meeting on Thursday. It comes as North Korea is preparing to hold its biggest political conference later this month, where Kim is expected to outline his major policy goals for the next five years and take steps to tighten his authoritarian grip.",

      "description": "A broad coalition of unions and farmers in India has held a one-day national strike against an interim trade deal with the United States. The strike Thursday disrupted some public services and factory work. Protest leaders say the pact harms small farmers, workers and local businesses. Opposition lawmakers in Parliament demanded the deal be scrapped. Union leaders say the deal opens India to subsidized American farm products. They also condemn privatization and new labor codes. The government defends the pact and says it protects farmers. U.S. and Indian officials say the framework lowers tariffs and deepens ties.",

      "description": "The House has voted to slap back President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada. The tally offered a rare rebuke of the White House agenda, though it wouldn\u2019t actually undo the tariffs without support from Trump himself, which is highly unlikely. Almost instantly, Trump issued his own rebuke with a political warning to those who would dare cross him. He believes in the power of tariffs to force U.S. trade partners to the negotiating table. But lawmakers are facing unrest back home from businesses caught in the trade wars and constituents navigating high prices. House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to prevent a vote, but his strategy collapsed. Several Republicans joined with Democrats in favor of the resolution. It next goes to the Senate.",

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the latest figures Thursday. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. Iran\u2019s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran\u2019s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.",

Increasingly nervous European leaders are hoping for at least a brief reprieve from President Donald Trump\u2019s often inconsistent policies and threats that have roiled transatlantic relations and the post-World War II international order. A year after Vice President JD Vance stunned assembled dignitaries at the same venue with a verbal assault on many of America\u2019s closest allies in Europe, Rubio plans to take a less contentious but philosophically similar approach when he addresses the annual conference on Saturday. That's according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.",

      "description": "Taiwan's economy is thriving thanks to the boom in artificial intelligence, driven by strong demand for computer chips and other products made by companies like TSMC and Foxconn. The island's economy grew at an 8.6% annual pace last year and a recent trade deal with Washington may give it a further boost. But Taiwan's heavy reliance on computer chip makers and other technology companies also carries the risk of the AI craze turning out to be a bubble. Beijing claims the self-governed island as its own territory, a persisting threat for Taiwan despite its vital role in Chinese and global supply chains.",
