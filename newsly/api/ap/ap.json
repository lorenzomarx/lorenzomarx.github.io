      "description": "Millions of Southern Californians are on edge as a final round of dangerous fire weather is forecast for the region on Wednesday, along with a rare warning of a \u201cParticularly Dangerous Situation\u201d for an area near where two massive blazes have killed at least 25 and destroyed thousands of homes. Firefighters got a reprieve Tuesday when winds were unexpectedly light and they were able to make progress battling the two huge Los Angeles area fires and quickly snuff out several new fires. The Eaton Fire burning just north of Los Angeles and the Palisades Fire that destroyed much of the seaside LA neighborhood of Pacific Palisades broke out Jan. 7 in conditions similar to what\u2019s expected Wednesday.",

      "description": "Fires that have been burning homes and businesses in Los Angeles for a week have killed at least 25 people, displaced thousands of others and destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Nearly 30 people are missing. The blazes started early last week and have been powered by gusts from the Santa Ana winds, which strengthened Tuesday. Investigators have not determined what sparked the fires. Estimates suggest they could be the nation's costliest ever. The National Weather Service issued a rare warning about a \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d related to severe fire conditions.",

But meteorologist Todd Hall says they're possible given the extreme conditions. Fire whirl, fire devil, fire tornado or even firenado \u2014 scientists, firefighters and regular folks use multiple terms to describe similar phenomena, and they don\u2019t always agree on what\u2019s what. Some say fire whirls are formed only by heat, while fire tornados involve clouds generated by the fire itself. In 2018, a fire tornado the size of three football fields killed a firefighter near Redding, California.",

The Golden Globes had transpired less than 48 hours earlier and a series of splashy awards banquets followed in the days after. But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",

GoFundMe says more than $100 million has already been raised for wildfire victims on the platform. Ella Marx from Michigan is among those who chipped in. She came across an appeal from a woman who said the houses of her grandmother and three aunts were all destroyed by the Eaton Fire and quickly donated $20.",

      "description": "If the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal goes according to the current draft, then fighting will stop in Gaza for 42 days, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed. In this first phase Israeli troops will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as stepped-up aid flows in. The question is if the ceasefire will survive beyond that first phase. That will depend on even more negotiations meant to begin within weeks. In those talks, Israel, Hamas, and the U.S, Egyptian and Qatari mediators will have to tackle the tough issue of how Gaza will be governed, with Israel demanding the elimination of Hamas.",

On Wednesday, Biden will have an opportunity to reconcile his promises and the results when he delivers a farewell address to the nation. But only a quarter of Americans say he has been a good or great president, even lower than views of Trump when he left office four years ago after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. It's a difficult ending for Biden, who had hoped to serve as a transformational leader only to see the country turn back to his predecessor.",
