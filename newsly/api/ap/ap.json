      "description": "Former President Joe Biden's office says he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Biden was seen last week by doctors after urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was found. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone. His office said Sunday this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, but the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.",

The hospitals and medics said women and children were among the dead.

Trump expressed his hopes for a \u201cproductive day\u201d Monday \u2014 and a ceasefire \u2014 in a social media post over the weekend. His effort will also include calls to NATO leaders. Trump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022. That makes these conversations a serious test of his reputation as a dealmaker after having claimed he'd quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, or even before he took office.",

The House Budget Committee will hold a rare Sunday night committee meeting after that same panel voted against advancing the measure two days earlier. Speaker Mike Johnson is looking to reverse that setback, get the bill out of the committee and bring it to a vote in the full House before the end of the week. Deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers on the budget panel in voting against reporting the measure to the full House. Five Republicans voted no, one on procedural grounds, the other four voicing concerns about the bill\u2019s impact on federal budget deficits.",

The meeting on Monday between U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and top EU officials is intended to pave the way to a new agreement between the two sides.

The union says the engineers and the transit agency came to an agreement Sunday and trains would resume running their regular schedules on Tuesday. The main sticking point had been achieving a wage increase for the engineers without creating a financially disastrous domino effect for the transit agency. It was the state\u2019s first transit strike in over 40 years, forcing people who normally rely on New Jersey Transit to find alternative transport or consider staying home.",

Found only on the island of Socotra, these umbrella-shaped trees have long captured the imaginations of tourists. But protecting them has fallen to residents like Sena Keybani. Her family runs a small nursery for the trees. Scientists warn the species could disappear within centuries. For Socotra, losing the trees would mean losing both an ecosystem and a fragile economy.",
