The contest Sunday pits Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, a liberal pro-European Union figure, against Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party. The outcome will determine whether Poland continues along a nationalist path or pivots more decisively toward liberal democratic norms. With President Andrzej Duda completing his second and final term, the new president will have significant influence over the legislative agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist government, given the presidential power to veto laws.",

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised. The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add $5.1 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if they are allowed to continue. That's according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",

The findings were featured Sunday at a cancer meeting in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Experts say cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a new standard of care. Researchers followed 889 patients with treatable colon cancer who had completed chemotherapy. Half were given health information while the others worked with an exercise coach. Over time, the people in the structured exercise program had 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause.",
