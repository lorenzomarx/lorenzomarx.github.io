      "description": "President Donald Trump keeps talking about sending U.S. citizens who commit violent crimes to prison in El Salvador. But that's likely illegal. The whole purpose of sending people to the Central American country's prisons is that they're harsher than ones in the United States and federal courts would have no way of ensuring prisoners' rights were respected. That violates several constitutional guarantees. Additionally, only immigrants, not U.S. citizens, can be deported from the United States. Trump has said his administration is trying to find ways to make such incarceration legal anyway.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s top advisers and El Salvador president Nayib Bukele say that they have no basis for the small Central American nation to return a Maryland man who was wrongly deported there last month. Trump administration officials are emphasizing that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to a notorious gang prison in El Salvador, was a citizen of that country and that U.S. has no say in his future. And Bukele, who has been a vital partner for the Trump administration in its deportation efforts, said \u201cof course\" he won't release him back to U.S. soil. The Supreme Court has called for the Trump administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Abrego Garcia to the U.S.",

      "description": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's story begins in El Salvador. But it's become increasingly unclear where it will end. His attorneys say he fled his native country at 16 because a local gang threatened to kill him. He then lived in Maryland for 14 years and started a family. He was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison last month. The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to return him. But the White House pushed back against the idea on Monday. It maintains that he\u2019s an MS-13 gang member. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia say there\u2019s no evidence he was in a gang.",

It also includes an audit of the study body and faculty on their views about diversity, as well as a ban on face masks which appeared to target pro-Palestinian protesters.",

U.S. District Judge William Sessions took under advisement Monday arguments over Rumeysa Ozturk. She was taken by immigration officials as she was walking in a Boston suburb on March 25. After being taken to New Hampshire and then Vermont, she was put on a plane the next day and moved to an immigration detention center in Louisiana. Ozturk\u2019s lawyers are challenging that authority. They've asked that she be immediately released. A Justice Department lawyer says the immigration court has jurisdiction.",

They argue the government denied them due process when it suddenly took away their permission to be in the U.S. The actions by the federal government to terminate students\u2019 legal status have left hundreds of scholars at risk of detention and deportation. Their schools range from private universities like Harvard and Stanford to large public institutions like the University of Maryland and Ohio State University to some small liberal arts colleges. Colleges say some students are being singled out over infractions as minor as traffic violations, including some long in the past.",

Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident who has held a green card since 2015, was detained Monday. His attorneys, who have filed a petition in federal court seeking an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country, say they do not know where he is.

The elephants run as the video from the Southern California park starts to shake and then they appear to encircle the young. They stay in the cluster for several minutes after the rocking stops. The park says elephants have the ability to feel sound through their feet, and the behavior is known as an \u201calert circle.\u201d The quake that hit Monday morning and was centered in San Diego County caused no injuries or major damage.",
