      "description": "President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington. And that's leading the city\u2019s mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation\u2019s capital. Trump says in a social media post that he plans a White House news conference at 10 a.m. Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia, in his words, \u201csafer and more beautiful than it ever was before.\u201d On Thursday, the Republican president directed an increased federal law enforcement presence in the Democratic-run city for seven days, \u201cwith the option to extend as needed.\u201d Federal agencies including the FBI assigned more than 120 officers and agents to assist in Washington.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Had that happened the U.S. would have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing would have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China. The pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.",

Trump plans to meet Putin on Friday in Alaska. He suggested on Monday that he could know how serious Putin is within two minutes. He also refused to say if the meeting should involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and appeared dismissive of Zelenskyy's role. European allies want Ukraine involved to prevent a deal favoring Moscow. Germany plans a separate, virtual meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and other leaders to prepare for peace negotiations.",

      "description": "A federal judge in New York has ruled transcripts of secret grand jury testimony in the sex trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell won\u2019t be released. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued his written ruling on Monday. The judge says releasing the transcripts would risk unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term after her conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping procure girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell recently was interviewed by the Department of Justice and was moved from a prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas. Maxwell's attorney says she testified truthfully.",

      "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel plans to widen its coming offensive beyond Gaza City to the last areas not yet under Israeli control. Most of Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents have sought shelter in those areas as the territory slides toward famine. The mobilization of forces is expected to take weeks, and Israel may be using the threat of a wider offensive to try to pressure Hamas. Any expansion of Israeli operations is likely to bring even more death and destruction to the war-ravaged territory. The plans have also sparked controversy in Israel, where many fear for the lives of the remaining hostages.",
