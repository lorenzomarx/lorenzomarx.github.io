      "description": "Authorities say a man who wounded 12 people in an attack on a group holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza had planned to kill them all but appeared to have second thoughts. They say Mohamed Sabry Soliman had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday\u2019s attack in which he yelled \u201cFree Palestine. The two incendiary devices he did throw into the group of about 20 people were enough to wound more than half of them, and authorities say he expressed no regrets about the attack. Federal and state prosecutors have filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively.",

      "description": "Palestinian health officials and witnesses say Israeli forces fired on people as they headed toward an aid distribution site Tuesday, killing at least 27, in the third such incident in three days. The army said it fired \u201cnear a few individual suspects\u201d who left the designated route, approached its forces and ignored warning shots. The near-daily shootings have come after an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation established aid distribution points inside Israeli military zones, a system it says is designed to circumvent Hamas. The United Nations has rejected the new system, saying it doesn\u2019t address Gaza\u2019s mounting hunger crisis and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of casualties on Tuesday.",

Pre-election surveys suggest liberal Lee Jae-myung appears headed for an easy win in Tuesday\u2019s election, riding on deep public frustration over the conservatives in the wake of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle. Conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo has struggled to restore public confidence. The winning candidate will be immediately sworn in as president Wednesday for a full, single five-year term.",

Miles Taylor was the author of an anonymous op-ed in 2018 in The New York Times that was sharply critical of Trump. In an April 9 memorandum, the Republican president accused Taylor of making up stories to sell his book and directed government agencies to investigate Taylor and strip him of any security clearances. Taylor tells The Associated Press he spent the last few weeks debating what to do after the Trump memorandum and decided to fight back.",

The government denies that any civilians have been targeted. Many of the wounded are being transported to a Red Cross hospital in Akobo near the border with Ethiopia. The fighting began in March when a militia called the White Army overran a military barracks in the northeastern town of Nasir. The government blamed the attack on the opposition party of First Vice President Riek Machar and placed him under house arrest. It has launched offensives against militias across the country.",

      "description": "A surprise Ukrainian drone attack that targeted Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers was unprecedented in its scope and sophistication, and dealt a heavy blow to the Russian military. Ukraine said more than 40 bombers were damaged or destroyed Sunday. That's about a third of Russia's strategic fleet. The Russian military said only several planes were damaged. The conflicting claims couldn\u2019t be independently verified. But the bold attack demonstrated Ukraine\u2019s capability to hit high-value targets anywhere on Russian territory, dealing a humiliating blow to the Kremlin and inflicting significant losses to Moscow\u2019s arsenal in the 3-year-old war.",

Wilders announced his decision Tuesday in a message on X after a brief meeting in parliament of leaders of the four parties that make up the 11-month-old administration. It was not immediately clear what Wilders\u2019 decision will mean for the government of Prime Minister Dick Schoof. After years in opposition, Wilders\u2019 party won the last election on pledges to slash migration. He has grown increasingly frustrated at what he sees as the slow pace of the coalition\u2019s efforts to implement his plans.",
