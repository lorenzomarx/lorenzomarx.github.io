      "description": "Iran's top diplomat has held talks with the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Geneva a day before a second round of negotiations between the U.S. and Iran. Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with IAEA chief Rafael Grossi and later planned to hold talks with Oman\u2019s foreign minister. Oman is hosting the U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran\u2019s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, but then shifted to a pressure campaign to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program.",

      "description": "The FBI says a glove containing DNA was found about 2 miles from Nancy Guthrie\u2019s home and appears to match those worn by a masked person outside her front door in Tucson the night she vanished. The glove, found in a field near the side of the road, was sent off for DNA testing. The discovery was revealed days after investigators had released surveillance videos of the masked person outside Guthrie\u2019s front door. Guthrie is the mother of \u201cToday\u201d show host Savannah Guthrie and was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31.",

There was no anticipation of any significant progress on ending the war at the Tuesday-Wednesday meeting in Switzerland. Both sides are sticking to their negotiating positions on key issues despite the United States setting a June deadline to reach a settlement. Ukraine is locked in a war of attrition with Russia\u2019s bigger army on the front line while Ukrainian civilians endure Russian aerial barrages that repeatedly knock out power and smash homes.",

FBI agents arrived at the elections warehouse with a warrant seeking 2020 Fulton County election records. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",

      "description": "The abduction of 10 mine workers in Mexico's Sinaloa state has raised questions again about the government's touted security improvements. In late January, gunmen abducted workers from a Canadian-owned silver and gold mine near Panuco. Authorities have identified five bodies and are working to identify five more. Since September 2024, two Sinaloa Cartel factions have fought across the state. President Claudia Sheinbaum points to lower homicide rates but analysts say episodes like this undermine her message. Security forces add troops and make arrests yet residents say fear, displacement and missing people keep rising.",

On Sunday night, Academicos de Niteroi filled Rio de Janeiro's Sambadrome with floats and songs about Lula\u2019s rise from poverty to national power. The school\u2019s organizer says it is a cultural tribute, not campaign material. Analysts say the risk sits with any link to his administration. Brazil's top electoral court has rejected attempts to block the parade but judges say they might review the case if they find that rules were broken.",
