      "description": "President Donald Trump is heading to Capitol Hill to seal the deal on his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d Using his power of political persuasion, Trump will try to unify divided House Republicans on the multitrillion-dollar package that is at risk of collapsing ahead of planned votes this week. The president has implored GOP holdouts to \u201cSTOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE.\u201d But negotiations are slogging along. It\u2019s not at all clear the package, with its sweeping tax breaks and cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs, has the support needed. With all Democrats opposed, the Republicans can handle only a few defections from their slim House majority.",
