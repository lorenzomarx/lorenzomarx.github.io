      "description": "State media says Iran executed three more prisoners Wednesday for alleged spying in the latest hangings connected to its war against Israel. The hangings happened in Urmia Prison in Iran\u2019s West Azerbaijan province, which is the country\u2019s most northwest province. IRNA cited Iran\u2019s judiciary for the news, saying the men had been accused of bringing \u201cassassination equipment\u201d into the country. Iran has carried out several hangings during its war with Israel, sparking fears from activists that it could conduct a wave of executions after the conflict ended.",

      "description": "The Gaza Health Ministry says hundreds of premature babies are at risk of death from starvation across the war-battered Gaza Strip. Mothers and others blame Israel\u2019s blockade for the plight of their children. Doctors say that although some formula has been delivered, the situation is dire. Their desperation comes as the war in Gaza has been overshadowed by the Israel-Iran war. Doctors say formula is crucial because many mothers can't breastfeed because they are malnourished. One hospital recently received a supply of formula but more deliveries aren't guaranteed. The director of another hospital says it is out of stock of the fortified formula required for newborns.",

That's despite a preliminary American intelligence assessment suggesting that the assault inflicted only a marginal setback.

The administration deployed a phalanx of top officials to defend Trump's claims that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated.\u201d Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said was assessment was \u201cpreliminary\u201d and \u201clow confidence.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the officials who disclosed the findings are \u201cprofessional stabbers.\u201d",

Investors have shifted their focus to comments to Congress by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rallied 1.1% to within 0.8% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%. Oil prices gained more than 1% early Wednesday after falling about 6% on Tuesday on hopes that Israel\u2019s war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. Lower oil prices could give the Fed leeway to cut interest rates to help the economy, and Powell said it is waiting for the right time to do so.",
