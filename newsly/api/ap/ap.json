The storm threatens to knock out power for days and snarl major roadways. Roughly 140 million people were under a winter storm warning from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecast warns of widespread heavy snow and a band of catastrophic ice stretching from east Texas to North Carolina. The edge of the storm was sending freezing rain and sleet into parts of Texas on Friday night, while snow and sleet were falling in Oklahoma.",

Trump said in a social media post that if Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \u201cthinks he is going to make Canada a \u201cDrop Off Port\u201d for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\u201d Canada this month negotiated a deal to lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in return for lower import taxes on Canadian farm products. Trump initially had said that agreement was what Carney \u201cshould be doing and it\u2019s a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\u201d",

Netanyahu met with President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The U.S. is eager to keep the Trump-brokered deal moving, but Netanyahu faces pressure not to progress until Hamas returns the body of the last hostage. Meanwhile, Egypt's foreign minister is pushing for the Rafah border crossing to open. On Saturday, an Israeli strike killed two Palestinian children in Gaza. The children were searching for firewood. The Israeli military said it targeted militants, not children.",

That\u2019s according to an email obtained by The Associated Press. The move could introduce a new level of risk for the companies. The purchasing rule changes would reverse nearly two decades of bipartisan consensus that limits should be imposed after the government bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-09. That crisis led to to them being placed into a government conservatorship.",

Jasmine Crockett and James Talarico are facing off Saturday afternoon during the Texas AFL-CIO\u2019s political convention. Crockett is a 44-year-old Dallas civil rights lawyer and former public defender who's in her second term in Congress. Talarico is a state representative and former teacher. The primary is March 3. They're running for the seat held by John Cornyn. The four-term Republican senator is facing two challengers in the GOP primary. Democrats are trying to regain a Senate majority, but Texas hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office in 30-plus year.",

Former Trump supporter Feliza Martinez is rallying volunteers to support immigrant children with food, financial support and shelter. Earlier this month, Martinez relocated a family of 10 to a safe house in south Minneapolis after their Ecuadorian mother was detained for illegally entering the country in 2022. Federal agents have pursued her children, and the older siblings fear they will be separated from their 5-month-old U.S. citizen brother.",

If winter weather is expected, airlines might also allow you to postpone your trip without fees. If your flight is canceled, airlines usually rebook for free, but availability can be limited during peak times. You're entitled to a full refund if you choose not to travel or find a different way to get to your destination, but airlines aren\u2019t required to cover lodging or meals for stranded passengers. Booking a backup flight if forecasts look bad is another option because some airlines offer full refunds as long as a passenger cancels within 24 hours of booking.",
