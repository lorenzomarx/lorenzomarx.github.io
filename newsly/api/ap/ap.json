      "description": "President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order on Tuesday that would continue downsizing the federal workforce. He wants strict limits on hiring, with agencies only adding one new employee for every four who leave. He also wants agencies to plan for \u201clarge-scale reductions in force,\u201d a phrase that's normally used to describe layoffs. A White House fact sheet on the executive order was reviewed by the Associated Press. It's intended to advance Elon Musk\u2019s work slashing spending with his Department of Government Efficiency. Musk's work has been controversial, and Democrats accuse him of consolidating power.",

      "description": "A new lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of stiffing U.S. businesses of hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done amid its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in D.C. on behalf of an organization representing 173 American small businesses, large U.S.-based suppliers, a Jewish group working for displaced people and others. It says President Donald Trump's foreign aid funding freeze has left hundreds of millions of dollars of owed bills unpaid and goods stuck in the supply chain. The USAID deputy administrator has defended the funding cutoff in an affidavit in another lawsuit.",

Julie Pace, senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press, called the administration\u2019s move troubling and unacceptable.

President Donald Trump waded into the issue Monday when he signed an executive order to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long. Trump said he thinks it\u2019s OK to continue using plastic straws, although they\u2019ve have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life. In 2015, video of a marine biologist pulling a plastic straw out of a turtle\u2019s nose sparked outrage worldwide and countries and cities started banning them.",
