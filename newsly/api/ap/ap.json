      "description": "President Donald Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders focused on the military. One directs Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revise the Pentagon\u2019s policy on transgender troops, likely setting in motion a future ban on their military service. Other orders would roll back diversity programs, create a space-based missile defense system and reinstate troops booted for refusing COVID-19 vaccines. The orders come just after Hegseth began his first day on the job Monday. A transgender ban had been widely expected, and lawyers for transgender troops have already pledged to fight it.",

      "description": "At least 56 senior officials in the top U.S. aid and development agency have been placed on leave amid an investigation into an alleged effort to thwart President Donald Trump\u2019s orders. U.S. Agency for International Development acting head Jason Gray said Monday in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press that the move was part of an investigation into possible efforts at the agency to thwart Trump's orders. A current official and a former official at USAID recounted the actions on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. The move comes as a sweeping foreign assistance funding freeze by Trump was beginning to shut down U.S.-funded projects around the world.",

      "description": "The Trump Justice Department says it has fired more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal investigations into President Donald Trump. The abrupt action targeting career prosecutors who worked on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team is the latest sign of upheaval inside the Justice Department. It reflects the administration\u2019s determination to purge the government of workers it perceives as disloyal to the president. The move, which follows the reassignment of multiple senior career officials across divisions, was made even though rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain in their positions across presidential administrations and are not punished because of their involvement in sensitive investigations.",

An Associated Press review of nearly 100 podcasts that Patel hosted or on which he was interviewed over the last four years reveals how Patel has denigrated the investigations into Trump, sowed doubt in the criminal justice system, criticized the decision-making of the institution he\u2019s been asked to lead and professed sympathy for jailed Jan. 6 rioters. The vast catalog of provocative public statements, sometimes made in the company of like-minded FBI antagonists, provides an unusually extensive record into a nominee\u2019s unvarnished and controversial worldviews.",

A dozen officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement gathered before dawn Monday in a Maryland parking lot, then fanned out to the Washington suburbs to find their targets: someone wanted in El Salvador for homicide, a person convicted of armed robbery in Maryland, a migrant found guilty of possessing child sexual abuse material and another with drug and gun convictions. All were in the country illegally. The Associated Press accompanied the officers, who offered a glimpse of how their work has changed.",

The collapse, which killed 15 people, has become a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with Serbia\u2019s authoritarian rule, reflecting growing public demands for transparency. Vucevic\u2019s resignation is likely to lead to an early parliamentary election. On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined striking university students in a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the Serbian capital.",

The 15-month war, which has killed more than 47,000 people and displaced most of the population of 2.3 million, left a health system in shambles and large swaths of the territory reduced to rubble. A shortage of clean water and damaged sewer systems have spurred worries over the spread of infectious disease. Now aid groups are rushing to provide food and supplies amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas while planning the best way forward.",
