In a brief order early Saturday, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \u201cuntil further order of this court.\u201d Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The high court acted in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",

      "description": "Iran and the United States are preparing for a second round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program in Rome. The talks Saturday in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Whether the two men find common ground in the high-stakes negotiations could mean success or failure in the talks. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon.",

The full scope of campus DEI rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices. But students at some schools say early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that has helped open the door to higher education. The retreat from DEI has accelerated under President Donald Trump and his threats to cut federal funding.",

That, after a remarkable papal rebuke of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on migrants and Vance\u2019s justification of it. Vance was due to meet Saturday with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. There was speculation he might also briefly greet Pope Francis. The 88-year-old pope has sharply cut back his agenda while he recovers from pneumonia but has begun to resume some official activities. Vance, a Catholic convert, was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Friday after meeting with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.",

A report issued late Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said frequent strong aftershocks continue to shake central Myanmar almost daily, increasing fear and uncertainty among affected residents, disrupting response efforts and exacerbating the pressure on already limited resources and services. The quake hit a wide swath of the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states including the capital, Naypyitaw, and worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis.",

Differences in tradition and calendar systems \u2014 Julian vs. Gregorian \u2014 have long kept Easter dates apart.
