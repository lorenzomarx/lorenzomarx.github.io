      "description": "Canadians are set to decide whether to extend the Liberal Party\u2019s decade in power or instead hand control to the Conservatives. They\u2019ll pick either Prime Minister Mark Carney or opposition leader Pierre Poilievre to lead the way forward, but Monday's election is also a referendum of sorts on a non-Canadian: Donald Trump. Until the American president won a second term and began threatening Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty, even suggesting the country should become the 51st state, the Liberals looked headed for defeat. But Trump\u2019s truculence has infuriated many Canadians and led to a tightening of the race. Whichever candidate becomes prime minister will face big challenges, including a trade war and resetting of Canada's relationship with the United States.",

      "description": "The White House is opening a weeklong celebration of President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. Officials kicked off the promotional campaign on Monday with a focus on his immigration crackdown. Tom Homan, Trump's top border adviser, said \u201cwe're going to keep doing it, full speed ahead.\u201d Trump is holding a rally in Michigan on Tuesday and delivering a commencement address at the University of Alabama on Thursday. Although immigration remains the Republican president's strongest issue in public opinion surveys, he's faced declining support overall. There are concerns that he's focused on the wrong issues, according to polling from AP-NORC.",

It's carrying 27 of Amazon's Project Kuiper satellites. It's the latest entry in the mega constellation market currently dominated by SpaceX's Starlinks. Amazon launched two test satellites in 2023. These upgraded new ones are coated with mirror film to scatter reflecting sunlight in an attempt to accommodate astronomers. Stargazers oppose these fast-growing satellite constellations, saying it spoils their observations. Amazon aims to put more than 3,200 of these satellites into orbit to provide fast, affordable broadband service around the globe.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the truce will run from the start of May 8 and last through the end of May 10 to mark Moscow\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Kyiv insisted on a longer and immediate truce. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump scaled up efforts to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. Until now, Putin had refused to accept a complete unconditional ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies to Ukraine and Kyiv\u2019s mobilization effort.",
