      "description": "Donald Trump will take the oath of office at noon, solidifying a political comeback without precedent in American history. He will become the 47th president on Monday after overcoming impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts. He takes charge as Republicans assume unified control of Washington, giving Trump a fresh opportunity to reshape the country's institutions. The inaugural ceremony was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda because of frigid weather. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on Washington to watch the proceedings from the National Mall will be left to find other places to view his ascension.",

But the singer\u2019s participation in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is nevertheless a sign of the changing tides. Mainstream entertainers from Nelly to The Village People are more publicly and more enthusiastically associating with the new administration. Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Lee Greenwood all performed at a MAGA style rally Sunday. Those performing at inaugural balls include Nelly, country music band Rascal Flatts, country singer Jason Aldean and singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw. Following the election, celebrity detractors have also been quieter than in 2017.",

      "description": "For millions in the U.S. illegally or with temporary legal status, the start of Donald Trump\u2019s second term as president comes with a feeling their time in the U.S. may end soon. Trump made mass deportations a signature issue of his campaign and has promised a raft of orders to remake immigration policy when he takes office Monday. Plans for deportation arrests appear to be in flux after news leaked of an operation in Chicago this week. Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan said on Fox News Sunday that Chicago was not off the table, but officials were reconsidering when and how to conduct enforcement. So-called sanctuary cities such as Chicago, which limit how local police cooperate with federal immigration authorities, have been a favorite Trump target.",

      "description": "Even before the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was fully in place, Palestinians in the war-battered Gaza Strip began to return to the remains of the homes they had evacuated during the 15-month war. They trekked through the wreckage, some on foot and others hauling their belongings on donkey carts. The return of the families comes amid looming uncertainty about whether the ceasefire deal will bring more than a temporary halt to the fighting, who will govern the enclave and how it will be rebuilt. The United Nations has said that reconstruction could take more than 350 years if Gaza remains under an Israeli blockade.",
