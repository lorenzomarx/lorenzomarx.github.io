      "description": "A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy has been asking Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest against immigration enforcement in the state. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer during an operation on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the area for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements online and in the streets. But Friday\u2019s mobilization was planned as the largest action to date, including a march in downtown Minneapolis despite dangerously cold temperatures.",

      "description": "It has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the U.S. to not open the door for federal immigration agents unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people\u2019s homes without a judge\u2019s warrant. That marks a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades. Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more agents barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.",

The Kremlin meeting, which lasted past 3 a.m. Friday, came hours after Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sharply criticized his European allies Thursday for what he cast as their slow and fragmented response to Russia\u2019s nearly four-year full-scale invasion. Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov, who took part in Putin\u2019s meeting with Trump\u2019s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, said it would be impossible to reach a peace deal \u201cwithout solving the territorial issue.\u201d",

The scene in the Muwasi area of the city of Khan Younis contrasted starkly with the vision of the territory projected by world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, where they inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Board of Peace that will oversee Gaza on Thursday. Trump claimed in Davos this week that \u201crecord levels\u201d of humanitarian aid had entered Gaza since the October start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal. His envoys touted the enclave's development potential.",

      "description": "Activists report that Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people. Many more are feared dead, but information is scarce in part because Iran has imposed the most comprehensive internet blackout in its history. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency provided the latest death toll Friday and noted more than 26,800 people have been detained. Iran's government says 3,117 have died, but it has a history of giving lower tolls for political reasons. The Associated Press has been unable to verify these numbers due to the two-week internet shutdown. Meanwhile, the U.S. has moved an aircraft carrier group closer to the Middle East, and President Donald Trump is warning of potential action against Iran.",

The forecasted days-long event threatens catastrophic damage, extensive power outages and bitterly cold weather in the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. Forecasters warn the storm could rival a hurricane in damage to power lines and trees, especially in areas with heavy ice. The storm is expected to start Friday in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, moving east through the South and then up the coast into New England. Bitterly cold air could follow, with wind chills dropping to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota.",
