      "description": "Protesters in Israel have torched tires and blocked highways to demand a ceasefire to free hostages in Gaza. This comes as Israeli leaders push for an offensive against Hamas. The protest Tuesday follows deadly strikes on Gaza's main hospital that killed 20 people, including medics and journalists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected meet his cabinet later on Tuesday. Relatives of hostages hope steady pressure can push the government to commit to ceasefire talks. But far-right coalition members have threatened to bolt if Israel agrees to a truce. Most hostages taken on October 7, 2023, have been released, but 50 remain in captivity in Gaza.",

      "description": "India faces a major challenge as a steep U.S. tariff on Indian products takes effect. The import duties coming into force on Wednesday threaten over half of India's exports to its largest overseas market. The situation highlights the fragile trade ties between the two allies. President Donald Trump initially announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods, but then imposed an additional 25% tariff due to India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil. That brings the combined U.S. tariffs on India to 50%. The Indian government estimates that $48.2 billion worth of exports will be affected. Labor-intensive sectors like textiles and leather will likely be hit hardest. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed not to yield to U.S. pressure.",

      "description": "Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country after reports of covert influence operations in Greenland linked to people connected to Donald Trump. Both Denmark and Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, says the territory is not for sale, despite Trump's interest. Danish broadcaster DR reported Wednesday that at least three Americans have been involved in these operations. They allegedly compiled lists of U.S.-friendly Greenlanders and tried to influence local politics. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service believes Greenland is a target for influence campaigns. It said it is strengthening its efforts and presence in Greenland in cooperation with authorities there.",

He has accused them of mortgage fraud and encouraged investigations. This week, Trump used Pulte's allegations to attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve board of governors. Cook plans to fight her removal. Pulte has also targeted other Democrats but ignored similar cases involving Republicans. His actions align with Trump's efforts to pressure opponents using federal power. Pulte, a housing industry scion, has a history of political donations to Trump and his allies.",

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen on Tuesday granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise would \"offend the rule of law.\u201d Cullen was nominated by President Donald Trump and serves in Virginia but was tapped to oversee the case because all of Maryland\u2019s federal judges were named as defendants.

Wholesale prices on the St. Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange for the highest octane spiked to record highs last week, hitting rates about 50% higher than in January, as demand soared from farmers seeking to bring in the harvest and Russians hitting the roads for a last big vacation of the summer.

Authorities in Pakistan\u2019s eastern Punjab province on Wednesday called for army assistance in rescue and relief efforts after torrential rains caused major rivers to swell, inundating villages and displacing more than 150,000 people. Officials say rescuers evacuated more than 20,000 people overnight from the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan\u2019s second-largest city, which also faced the risk of flood. Those evacuated from areas near Lahore were living along the bed of the Ravi River.",
