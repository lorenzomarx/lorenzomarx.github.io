      "description": "An Israeli official says Cabinet ministers have approved plans to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. The official said the plan was gradual and involved claiming more territory in the Palestinian enclave. The approval comes a day after Israel announced it was calling up tens of thousands of reservist for the expanded operations in Gaza, which Israel says are meant to increase pressure on the militant Hamas group to negotiate a ceasefire that better aligns with Israel\u2019s terms. An eight-week ceasefire with the Hamas militant group collapsed in March when Israel resumed strikes in Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians, many of them women and children.",

      "description": "All Vatican personnel involved in supporting the upcoming papal conclave will take an oath of secrecy \u2014 under penalty of automatic excommunication. The ceremony, mandated by Vatican law and revised by Pope Benedict XVI, includes clerics and lay staff alike: cooks, cleaners, doctors, nurses and security officials. Nearly 135 cardinal electors will gather in the Sistine Chapel, beginning on Wednesday, to vote in secret for Pope Francis\u2019s successor. The oath, which explicitly forbids recording or disclosing anything from within the conclave, underscores the Church\u2019s insistence on confidentiality. Cardinals are bound by their own rules of secrecy. They will take their oaths on Wednesday as well.",

Trump has made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign. But that is a costly, resource-intensive endeavor.

      "description": "The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite harsh criticism from President Donald Trump and his demand that the Fed reduce borrowing costs. After causing a sharp drop in financial markets two weeks ago by saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the Republican leader backed off and said he had no intention of doing so. Still, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said the Fed should cut rates. The heightened scrutiny shows that even as the Trump administration backs off its threats to fire Powell, the Fed is still subject to unusually sharp political pressures, despite being an independent agency.",
