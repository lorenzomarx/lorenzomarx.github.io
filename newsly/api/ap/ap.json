      "description": "President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are starting their day by taking part in a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven economies to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump welcomed Macron to the White House on Monday at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations. The Republican meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Trump has transformed American foreign policy and effectively tuned out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war. The \u201cAmerica First\u201d president has cast a shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and ex-government officials had regarded as America\u2019s calming presence of global stability.",

      "description": "In a dramatic shift in transatlantic relations under President Donald Trump, the United States has split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in votes on three U.N. resolutions seeking an end to the three-year war. In the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. joined Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that calls out Moscow\u2019s aggression and demands an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. The U.S. then abstained from voting on its own competing resolution after Europeans. led by France, succeeded in amending it to make clear Russia was the aggressor. The voting was taking place as Trump was hosting French President Emmanuel Macron in Washington. A third vote took place in the U.N. Security Council.",

The high court turned down the appeals in orders handed down Monday, though two conservative justices disagreed. Activists argued the laws barring people from protesting or trying to dissuade women from abortions should be struck down after the justices overturned Roe v. Wade. The cities defending the laws in Illinois and New Jersey said they were passed to address disturbing behavior from protesters outside of health care clinics.",

The 88-year-old Francis has pneumonia in both lungs and remains in critical condition despite showing a slight improvement after 11 days in the hospital. Still, the mood was mostly grim in the monumental square on Monday evening, with many understanding they may be in Rome for Francis\u2019 final days. Crowds sat under umbrellas on folding chairs or stood by the vast colonnades as they reflected fondly on the pontiff\u2019s legacy.",

The two sides were supposed to start negotiating a second phase weeks ago in which Hamas would release all the remaining hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. But those talks have hardly begun, and the first phase has been jolted by one dispute after another.",
