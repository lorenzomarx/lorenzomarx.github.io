      "description": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul for a new round of direct peace talks with Russia on Monday,. The meeting comes even as Russia pounded Ukraine with a missile strike that killed 12 soldiers and the biggest drone assault of the three-year war. Ukrainian officials had previously called on the Kremlin to provide a promised memorandum setting out its position on ending the war before the meeting takes place. Moscow had said it would share its memorandum during the talks. Ukraine's air force says Russia launched the biggest number of drones on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion on Sunday.",

The witnesses said Israeli forces fired on crowds on Sunday around a kilometer away from an aid site run by an Israeli-backed foundation. The military released a brief statement saying it was unaware of any injuries caused by Israeli fire within the distribution site. The foundation said it delivered aid at its sites \u201cwithout incident\u201d early on Sunday. An Associated Press reporter saw dozens of people being treated at a nearby field hospital.",

      "description": "By making harsh, uncompromising demands in peace talks with Ukraine while continuing to pummel it with waves of missiles and drones, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a clear message: He will only accept a settlement on his terms and will keep fighting until they\u2019re met. At the same time, he has sought to avoid angering U.S. President Donald Trump by praising his diplomacy and declaring Moscow\u2019s openness to peace talks \u2014 even as he set maximalist conditions that are rejected by Kyiv and the West. Trump, who once promised to end the 3-year-old war in 24 hours, has upended the U.S. policy of isolating Russia by holding calls with Putin and denigrating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised. The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add $5.1 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if they are allowed to continue. That's according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",

The members of the Catholic campus ministry worship at a side altar reserved for these Masses. They see it as a sacred refuge amid a largely secular environment at the Ivy League school in New Jersey. News that the global Catholic Church would get its first U.S.-born pope was welcomed by Catholic students at Princeton and other U.S. universities. Some say they're hopeful that Pope Leo XIV will help bring a revival for Catholicism in America.",

In one of the incidents, seven people were killed and dozens were injured. The first bridge, in the Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine, collapsed on top of a passenger train on Saturday, causing the casualties. Hours later, officials said a second train derailed when the bridge beneath it collapsed in the nearby Kursk region, which also borders Ukraine. Russian investigators say they're treating the bridge collapses as potential acts of terrorism.",

The contest Sunday pits Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, a liberal pro-European Union figure, against Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party. The outcome will determine whether Poland continues along a nationalist path or pivots more decisively toward liberal democratic norms. With President Andrzej Duda completing his second and final term, the new president will have significant influence over the legislative agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist government, given the presidential power to veto laws.",
