On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs granted Harvard\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking the government\u2019s action until the case is decided. It had already been paused since last week, when Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order. Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security after Secretary Kristi Noem revoked its ability to host foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced a new effort to revoke Harvard\u2019s certification to enroll foreign students.",

      "description": "A federal appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to continue collecting tariffs under an emergency powers law for now, as his administration appeals an order striking down the bulk of his signature set of economic policies. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted an emergency motion Thursday from the Trump administration arguing that a halt is \u201ccritical for the country\u2019s national security.\u201d The appeals court temporarily halted the order from a federal trade court issued a day before. Trump is facing several lawsuits arguing Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs exceeded his authority and left the country\u2019s trade policy dependent on his whims.",

The moves not only take aim at criminal cases once touted as just by the Justice Department but also come amid a continuing Trump administration erosion of public integrity guardrails, including the firing of the department\u2019s pardon attorney and the near-dismantling of a prosecution unit established to hold public officials accountable for abusing the public trust.",

There\u2019s no specific definition of a \u201csanctuary jurisdiction\u201d but the term is often used to refer to communities that don\u2019t cooperate with immigration enforcement.
