      "description": "It\u2019s almost time to crown an NFL champion. After two weeks of hype and anticipation, the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will face off in Super Bowl 60 at Levi\u2019s Stadium. Will Drake Maye and the Patriots capture their seventh Lombardi Trophy? Or will Sam Darnold and the Seahawks earn their second? The matchup features two stingy defenses, two balanced offenses and two quarterbacks who\u2019ve taken vastly different routes to get here. The Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the NFL and have standout players at every level. The Patriots got here because their defense has been dominant in the playoffs.",

      "description": "Lindsey Vonn knows the Olympic downhill course better than anyone. She\u2019s won a record 12 World Cup races on the Olympia delle Tofane track and has a total of 20 podium results there stretching back to her very first on the entire circuit in 2004. So how did the 41-year-old American standout lose control just 12.5 seconds into her run and crash so spectacularly at the Milan Cortina Winter Games? The answer involved a critical, reverse-banked section of the course and an unfortunate bump. Vonn's mandatory safety air bag inflated under her racing suit during the crash and may have softened her landing.",

In China and Hong Kong, authorities defended the court's decision Monday, saying it reflects the spirit of the rule of law. Lai, a 78-year-old prominent democracy advocate, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was convicted of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and conspiring with others to publish seditious articles. Foreign governments and rights groups are calling for the release of the British citizen. But China's Foreign Ministry says Lai is a Chinese citizen, and is urging other countries to respect China\u2019s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong.",

Starmer lost his chief of staff on Sunday and is losing support after revelations about former British ambassador Peter Mandelson's ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer fired Mandelson in September after emails showed he maintained a friendship with Epstein. Critics say Starmer should have known better than to appoint Mandelson. Police are investigating Mandelson for potential misconduct. Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, resigned, taking responsibility for the appointment. Some hope his departure will allow Starmer to rebuild trust.",

They released a statement Monday, distancing themselves from former Prince Andrew's ties to the convicted sex offender. The royals are appalled by over 3 million pages of documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month. Their statement comes ahead of William's three-day trip to Saudi Arabia. The monarchy is responding to the crisis surrounding Andrew, who lost his royal titles in October. King Charles III recently forced Andrew to leave his home near Windsor Castle.

      "description": "Prolonged detention has become more common in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, at least partly because a new policy generally prohibits immigration judges from releasing detainees while their deportation cases wind through backlogged courts. The number of people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention has topped 70,000 for the first time. The agency said there were 7,252 people in custody at least six months in mid-January, including 79 held for more than two years. That\u2019s more than double the 2,849 who were in ICE custody at least six months in December 2024, the last full month of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",

Takaichi is expected to pursue market-friendly policies. She told public broadcaster NHK later that she is ready to pursue policies to make Japan strong and prosperous. The gains came after the U.S. stock market roared back on Friday as technology stocks recovered much of their losses from earlier in the week and bitcoin halted its plunge. The S&P 500 rallied 2% for its best day since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,206 points, or 2.5%, and topped the 50,000 level for the first time, while the Nasdaq composite leaped 2.2%.",
