      "description": "Israeli troops have opened fire on Palestinians near food distribution hubs in southern Gaza, killing at least 32 people. Witnesses say the shootings happened Saturday as crowds approached centers run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The foundation, established to replace U.N.-led aid efforts, claims Hamas diverts supplies, a charge the U.N. denies. Local health officials report hundreds have died near these hubs in recent months. Gaza faces a dire humanitarian crisis, with over 2 million residents on the brink of famine. The ongoing conflict has caused massive casualties and displacement, with no progress in ceasefire talks.",

      "description": "Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has urged Sunni Bedouin tribes to honor a ceasefire aimed at ending deadly clashes with Druze-linked militias Sweida. The violence has left hundreds dead and drawn Israeli airstrikes targeting Syrian forces. Al-Sharaa blamed \"armed groups from Sweida\u201d for reigniting the conflict on Thursday and criticized Israeli intervention. A separate U.S.-brokered ceasefire was announced early Saturday between Syria and Israel, but tensions remain high. Al-Sharaa emphasized unity, vowing to protect minorities and thanking the U.S. and Arab mediators for their support during Syria\u2019s ongoing crisis.",

The resolution represents a diplomatic achievement for Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and helps President Donald Trump in his goal of bringing home Americans jailed abroad. El Salvador will send back some 300 Venezuelan migrants whom the Trump administration agreed to pay $6 million to house in a notorious Salvadoran prison. The arrangement drew immediate blowback when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law to quickly remove men his administration had accused of belonging to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang.",

Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court has intensified his legal troubles, ordering house raids, an ankle monitor, and social media bans. Meanwhile, his successor, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has gained politically, with rising approval ratings and increased congressional support. Trump\u2019s actions have united critics across Brazil, including business leaders and lawmakers, who see the tariffs as an attack on national sovereignty, boosting Lula\u2019s political standing.",

      "description": "Congo and Rwanda-backed rebels have signed a declaration in Qatar to end decades of conflict in eastern Congo. The agreement announced Saturday includes a commitment to a permanent ceasefire and plans for a comprehensive peace deal within a month. It aims for the return of state authority in areas occupied by the rebels and a prisoner exchange program. A final agreement is expected by Aug. 18, aligning with a U.S.-facilitated peace accord between Congo and Rwanda in June. This marks the first direct commitment from both sides since rebels seized key cities in eastern Congo. The M23 rebel group, supported by Rwanda, is one of over 100 armed factions in the region. The U.N. calls this conflict one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.",
