Musk called the story \u201cfake news\u201d and said the staffers would have been fired if they didn't resign.",

      "description": "The turmoil that enveloped the federal workforce over the last few days is unlikely to cease anytime soon. The Office of Personnel Management is considering how to fulfill Elon Musk\u2019s demand to increase scrutiny of government employees. Musk serves as a top adviser to President Donald Trump, and he's leading efforts to cut spending and lay off workers. He recently demanded that employees explain their recent accomplishments or risk getting fired. Although that stalled on Monday, workers could face similar requests going forward. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said agencies would be implementing these goals.",

      "description": "Nearly 40% of the federal contracts that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration claims to have canceled as part of its signature cost-cutting program aren\u2019t expected to save the government any money, the administration\u2019s data shows. The Department of Government Efficiency, run by Elon Musk, published an updated list Monday of nearly 2,300 contracts that agencies terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on DOGE\u2019s \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 794 in all, are expected to yield no savings. That\u2019s usually because the total value of the contracts has already been fully obligated, which means the government is required to spend the funds for the goods or services it purchased.",

      "description": "Scientists have finally given the all-clear to Earth from a newly discovered asteroid. NASA and the European Space Agency said Tuesday that after two months of observations, scientists have almost fully ruled out any threat. At one point, the odds of a strike in 2032 were as high as about 3% and topped the world's asteroid-risk lists. But ESA lowered the odds to 0.001%. NASA had it down to 0.0027%. But there's still a 1.7% chance the asteroid could hit the moon in 2032. Discovered in December, the asteroid is about 130 feet to 300 feet across, and swings our way every four years.",

It's a step toward delivering President Donald Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d with $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $2 trillion in spending cuts. But the speaker is facing stiff opposition from Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans. Johnson has almost no votes to spare in a bare-bones GOP majority. Votes set for Tuesday evening are in jeopardy, and the outcome is uncertain. Republicans are finding the familiar problem that slashing federal spending is easier said than done, as constituents back home rely on Medicaid and other programs and services.",

She cast the change as a modernization of the press pool, saying the move would restore \u201caccess back to the American people\u201d who elected Trump.",
