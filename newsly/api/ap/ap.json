      "description": "U.S. importers are bracing for the impact of President Donald Trump's staggering 145% levy on Chinese imports. One Chicago-area toymaker expects its tariff bill to climb from $2 million to $100 million. The tariffs could mark the end of an era of inexpensive consumer goods in America. For four decades, Americans have relied on Chinese factories for everything from smartphones to Christmas ornaments. Trump is taking a sledgehammer to that arrangement in a bid to bring manufacturing back to the United States. China has retaliated by imposing a 125% tariff on American-made products effective Saturday.",

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, machines used to make semiconductors and flat-panel monitors would be exempt.",

      "description": "Democrats are quick to say that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are horrible, awful, terrible. But Democrats are also stressing that they\u2019re not inherently anti-tariff. What the president\u2019s political opponents say they really dislike is the \u201cchaos\u201d he's unleashed. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says \u201cTrump is creating chaos\" that undercuts the economy. The Democrats' message is meant to convey that they\u2019re reasonable, focused on capable governance and attuned to financial market distress. It\u2019s a pitch toward swing voters who'd like to see more manufacturing yet are uncomfortable with the consequences of Trump\u2019s approach to tariffs. To the Trump White House, that message is nothing but hypocrisy.",

      "description": "The upheaval in stocks has been grabbing all the headlines, but there is a bigger problem looming in another corner of the financial markets that rarely gets headlines: Investors are dumping U.S. government bonds. Normally, investors rush into them at a whiff of economic chaos but now not even the lure of higher interest payments on the bonds is getting them to buy. The freak development has experts worried that investors are losing faith in America as a good place to store their money. That could be bad news for consumers in need of a loan \u2014 and for President Donald Trump, who had hoped his tariff pause earlier this week would restore confidence in the markets.",

Luna of Florida said her experiences as a new mom in 2023 pointed to the need for allowing lawmakers to vote from afar. But her idea was fiercely opposed by Republican leaders. Speaker Mike Johnson repeatedly called proxy voting \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d After weeks of turmoil, Luna agreed to a compromise that helps accommodate lawmakers who are absent without voting by proxy. Members of the House are split on whether the new system goes far enough.",

      "description": "Many people involved in the abortion debate say a movement of so-called abortion abolitionists who want to punish women for having abortions is widening its influence. It began gaining momentum after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. And it's accelerated since Republicans won full political control in Washington in last year\u2019s elections. The movement\u2019s impact also is beginning to show up in statehouses. So far this year, bills introduced in at least 12 states would allow prosecutors to charge those who have abortions with homicide. Even leaders of mainstream anti-abortion groups who oppose criminal penalties have been targeted for attacks by abortion abolitionists.",

District Court Judge John Woodcock issued a temporary restraining order on Friday in a case brought by the state of Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A email message seeking comment was sent Saturday to the Agriculture Department.
