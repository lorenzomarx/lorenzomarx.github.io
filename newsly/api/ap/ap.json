      "description": "John Bolton is expected to surrender to authorities and make his first court appearance. The former Trump administration national security adviser is accused of storing top secret records at home and sharing with relatives diary-like notes that contained classified information. Bolton's lawyer says Bolton \"did not unlawfully share or store any information.\u201d Bolton is expected to appear later Friday in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland. It's the third case to be filed against a Trump adversary in the past month. There are concerns that the Justice Department is pursuing the Republican president\u2019s political enemies while at the same time sparing his allies from scrutiny.",

      "description": "Former National Security Advisor John Bolton has turned himself in to federal authorities in Maryland and pleaded not guilty after being indicted on charges of keeping top secret documents at his home and sharing classified information with family members. Bolton\u2019s criminal case is the third brought by the Justice Department in recent weeks against someone deemed adversarial to President Donald Trump. It also amplifies concerns that Trump is using the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency to punish political foes. Bolton didn\u2019t comment to reporters as he entered the federal courthouse Friday in Greenbelt, about 13 miles northeast of Washington. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Thursday against him.",

The U.S. leader is signaling he\u2019s not ready to agree to sell Kyiv a long-range missile system that the Ukrainians say they desperately need. The meeting comes a day after Trump had a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In recent days, Trump had shown openness to selling Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, even as Putin warned against it. Following Thursday\u2019s call with Putin, Trump appeared to downplay the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles.",

The militant group\u2019s statement, released in the early hours Friday, follows a dire warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that he would green-light Israel to resume the war if Hamas doesn\u2019t live up to its end of the deal. The militant group has also defended the killings in Gaza of alleged gang members who one official accused of causing death and destruction.

      "description": "A new AP-NORC poll finds that more U.S. adults support President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the conflict in Israel after he brokered a ceasefire deal in Gaza, but his approval ratings on domestic issues remain weak. The survey reveals that Trump\u2019s apparent success on the world stage has not improved his overall standing at home. Even some of those who voted for him believe he needs to do more to address issues such as the economy, health care and immigration. The poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, after the ceasefire deal was announced. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of the way Trump is handling his job overall, unchanged from September.",

The world's largest maritime nations had been discussing ways to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump urged countries to vote against the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday. The proposed regulations would have set a marine fuel standard and imposed fees for emissions above allowable limits. Shipping emissions have grown to about 3% of the global total, prompting calls for action.",
