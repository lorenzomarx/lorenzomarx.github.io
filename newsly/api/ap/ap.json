      "description": "Top Israeli Cabinet ministers are set to meet to vote on whether to intensify the country\u2019s military operations in the Gaza Strip, as the country's main airport was closed following a missile launched from Yemen. The army has begun to call up thousands of reserve soldiers in preparation for an expanded assault, Israeli officials said Sunday. The plans to escalate fighting in Gaza more than 18 months after the war there erupted come as a humanitarian crisis in the territory deepens. Houthi rebels on Sunday launched a missile that set off air raid sirens in many parts of the country. A large plume of smoke could be seen rising near Ben-Gurion Airport, according to footage shared by Israeli media.",

      "description": "Malnutrition and hunger are prevelant in the Gaza strip as Israel\u2019s blockade enters its third month. Shortage of food and supplies has driven the territory toward starvation. Supplies to treat and pervent malnutrition are depeleted and quickly running out as documented cases of malnutrition rise. Some 3,600 children were admitted and treated for acute malnutrition in the past month_ a figure that is likely rising. Parents are running out of options of what to feed their children and where to take fhem to get help. Images of emaciated children are becoming more frequent and hungry children at community kitchens are fighting for food, alongside adults.",

A year and a half of protests have emboldened activists and exposed a gulf between the government and those they govern. Demonstrators from across the political spectrum have taken to the streets to target the country's 4-year-old decision to normalize ties with Israel. Activists accuse the government of disregarding public sentiment and are expanding their targets, which now include the country's strategic ports. Protests swelled this month ahead of the docking of vessels suspected of carrying military cargo as part of a program that includes Israel.",

      "description": "While Pope Francis accomplished a lot in his 12-year papacy, he left much unfinished business and many challenges for his successor \u2014 from the Vatican\u2019s disastrous finances to the wars raging on multiple continents. When the conclave\u2019s cardinals finish casting their ballots in the Sistine Chapel, the 267th pope will have to decide whether to continue with Francis\u2019 policies, radically change them, or abandon them altogether. He also must choose what new projects will take precedence. Among the pressing issues are the role of women in the church, the division between traditionalists and progressives, what to do about clergy sex abuse and whether to LGBTQ+ Catholics.",

Viterbo is also considered the birthplace of the modern conclave, where cardinals are confined to a single place until they elect a new pontiff and often need to negotiate to reach a compromise on the final name.",

The social media post comes as the mourning of Pope Francis continues and the papal conclave is set to begin in a few days. The image is raising eyebrows on social media, at the Vatican, from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and from Italians. Catholics are in the period of official mourning after Francis' death. Catholic cardinals are due to open the solemn conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday. The death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics",
