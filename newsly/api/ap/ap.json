      "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly said during his campaign he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin 24 hours\u201d upon taking office. But since his Jan. 20 inauguration, the road to a peace deal has been fraught with changing dynamics between the U.S. leader, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward both Zelenskyy and Putin has evolved during the first months of his second term in the White House. The Republican leader has become increasingly exasperated with Putin in recent days, while he appears to have softened toward Zelenskyy after a February blowout in the Oval Office.",

      "description": "A wildfire along the Grand Canyon's North Rim grew rapidly over the weekend and destroyed a historic lodge and visitors center. Firefighters are working to slow down the fire that began on July 4 after a lightning trike. The fire is in a less popular area of the Grand Canyon that draws only about 10% of the park's millions of visitors. Evacuations were ordered over concerns that include chlorine gas exposure after a treatment plant burned. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has called for a federal investigation into the fire's management. Another wildfire in Colorado has closed Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, prompting evacuations and a disaster declaration by the state\u2019s governor.",

The GOP lawmakers are looking to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s request to claw back $9.4 billion in spending on public media and foreign aid. Senate Democrats are looking to kill the measure. The House has already approved the rescissions package on a mostly party line 214-212 vote. The Senate has little time to spare to beat the 45-day deadline for the Republican president\u2019s signature. If Congress fails to act by Friday, then the spending stands.",

The interior ministry said Monday that military forces will deploy to restore order. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 37 deaths and said the violence began after kidnappings and robberies escalated tensions between Druze and Sunni Bedouin groups. The ministry called the situation a dangerous escalation fueled by the absence of effective governance. Sweida is home to Syria\u2019s Druze minority and has seen unrest since the fall of former leader Bashar Assad, with Druze factions divided over integrating with the new government.",

It\u2019s the most vulnerable age group, accounting for about three-quarters of U.S. choking deaths. A number of companies are marketing antichoking devices to the elderly. They vary in design, but generally the devices look like a face mask attached to a tube or bellows, with a handle at the end. Medical professionals have been debating whether to endorse the products, saying more research is needed. Experts \u2014 and even antichoking device manufacturers \u2014 say that back blows and abdominal thrusts should always be tried first.",

      "description": "Fast fashion relies heavily on synthetic fibers that are made from oil and gas, fossil fuels that cause climate change. Once discarded, many of those materials end up in landfills. Some designers are working to cut those products out completely and instead use biomaterials. They are experimenting with tapioca, gelatin, agar agar, mushrooms, and other kitchen-shelf ingredients. Big names like Stella McCartney and Hermes have experimented with biomaterials like mushroom leather, while other early adopters are making fabrics out of corn and soy. Some experts are skeptical these textiles can be scaled up, but designers experimenting with biomaterials believe their experimentation could help push the industry away from the heavy pollution and waste that it currently produces.",
