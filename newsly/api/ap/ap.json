      "description": "President Donald Trump said this week that tariffs on U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico will arrive Saturday. The two nations are not only close geographically, but economically as well. The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023. That is far greater than the $643 billion in commerce that the U.S. did with China in that same year. Following are just a few imported goods that could be hit first.",

      "description": "Tariffs are in the news at the moment. But what are they? Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs.",

The party is desperately seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration. The leading candidates in Saturday's election are Wisconsin\u2019s Ben Wikler and Minnesota\u2019s Ken Martin. They\u2019re little-known state party chairs who are promising to refocus on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure and improve the party\u2019s anti-Trump rapid response system. More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election. The candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump has targeted the rights of transgender people in executive orders in his first two weeks back in office. He wants to use a federal definition of the sexes that excludes them, a reversal from President Joe Biden's administration policies that sought to expand legal protections. Trump has opened the door to ousting transgender service members from the military and is halting government funding for gender-affirming health care for young people. He also wants to reverse state and local policies that say students' preferred pronouns should be used in schools. Some of the orders are already facing court challenges and others are expected to.",

Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20. During Trump\u2019s first term, he had picked Chopra as a Democrat member of the Federal Trade Commission. Chopra was notified of his firing in an email from the White House. That's according to a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",

In Trump\u2019s view, the 25% tariffs against the two North American allies and a 10% tax on imports from Washington\u2019s chief economic rival are a way for the United States to throw around its financial heft to reshape the world. The Republican president is making a major political bet with this expected move on Saturday that his actions won't worsen inflation, cause financial aftershocks that could destabilize the worldwide economy or provoke a voter backlash.",
