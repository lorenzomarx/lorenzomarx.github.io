      "description": "Top Russian and U.S. officials are set to hold talks hold talks in Saudi Arabia in a bid to improve their ties and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting between the two countries\u2019 top diplomats in Riyadh on Tuesday would be their most significant since the Russia invaded its neighbor almost three years ago, and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this month, Trump upended U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war.",

      "description": "European leaders were summoned by French President Emmanuel Macron in a high-profile display of European coordination on Ukraine. But even as the French leader hosted heads of state in Paris, presenting himself as Europe\u2019s de facto leader, deep divisions lurked beneath the surface. With Trump administration officials preparing to negotiate directly with Russia, Macron seized the moment to convene key European players in Paris. Would Europe take charge of its own security, or would it remain sidelined? From Macron\u2019s push for European-led defense to Keir Starmer\u2019s \u2018third way\u2019 diplomacy, Giorgia Meloni\u2019s alignment with Trump, and Olaf Scholz\u2019s reluctance to break with NATO\u2019s traditional framework, the continent remains at odds over the best path forward.",

But they now fear it could come on unfavorable terms. Top U.S. and Russian officials plan to meet Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to discuss an end to the war. Kyiv won't participate. That rankles some Ukrainians who worry they will be sidelined.

The crash was the fourth major aviation accident in North America in the past three weeks. All 80 people on board the Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis that flipped Monday survived. Authorities say at least 18 people suffered relatively minor injuries. Communications between the tower at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport and the pilot were normal as the plane approached the runway.

      "description": "Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, jeopardizing health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program. The increasing number of Americans who signed up for taxpayer-funded health care coverage was lauded by Democrats during the Biden administration. But Republicans during the Trump administration are looking to slash federal spending. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers. The GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid and considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. Over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",

      "description": "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade. That's according to an AP investigation based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports. The investigation shows most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise. Many deaths occurred on the first day of physical training. Others came weeks in, sometimes after drills or timed runs on hot days. Experts were surprised by AP\u2019s findings and said many deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization tracks recruit deaths, unlike those of officers. Black men comprised nearly 60% of the deaths, while just 12% of local police forces.",

But as the number of civilians killed has also soared, so have fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people. The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn its enemies' movements.
