      "description": "Israel\u2019s military has targeted an Al Jazeera correspondent with an airstrike, killing him, another of its journalists and at least six other people sheltering outside a Gaza City hospital. Officials at Shifa Hospital confirmed the deaths of correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohamed Qureiqa, along with four other journalists and two other people. Israel's military described al-Sharif as a Hamas leader, an allegation dismissed by Al Jazeera. The network called the strike a \u201ctargeted assassination.\u201d This incident marks the first time during the conflict that Israel has swiftly claimed responsibility after a journalist's death. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports at least 186 journalists have been killed in Gaza.",

      "description": "Police in London are bracing for more demonstrations on Sunday as the war in Gaza continues to inflame tensions across the U.K. Demonstrators plan to march to the prime minister\u2019s residence, demanding the release of hostages in Gaza. The march organizers emphasize the humanitarian aspect of their demand for the hostages\u2019 release, saying it\u2019s not a political issue. This follows the arrest of 474 people on Saturday at a protest supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group. The group, Palestine Action, was banned after activists damaged military planes. Supporters are challenging the ban in court.",

      "description": "A blistering heatwave gripped southwest France on Monday, sending thermometers soaring to 43 degrees Celsius in parts of the Charente and Aude. In Aude, a patchwork of vineyards and Mediterranean scrubland, hundreds of firefighters remained on the hillsides guarding the edges of a massive blaze that scorched 16,000 hectares last week. Officials say the flames are under control, but warn the fire will not be fully extinguished for weeks. The national weather authority, Meteo-France, placed 12 departments on red alert, France\u2019s highest heat warning, anticipating exceptional heat stretching from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean plains. Another 41 departments were under lower-level orange alerts, as was the neighboring microstate of Andorra.",

      "description": "Ukrainian soldiers on the front line doubt that peace talks can end the war with Russia. Explosions from Russian weapons keep them underground and nothing on the Eastern Front suggests an end is near. Many soldiers feel diplomatic efforts are far removed from the battlefield, citing broken U.S. promises. Suggestions to exchange territories, such as leaving the Donetsk region, confuse and frustrate them. Some soldiers believe a brief pause in hostilities is more likely than peace. As the war drags on, soldiers train intensively, knowing there's no way back. Commanders say a ceasefire might happen, but true peace seems distant.",

Democrat Gretchen Whitmer came for the Oval Office meeting Tuesday with a visual presentation to warn that the tariffs threaten Michigan\u2019s economy and undermine Trump\u2019s promises to revive manufacturing. Trump has stuck with high import taxes despite pushback from auto executives as the tariffs cost the industry billions and trigger layoffs. Whitmer\u2019s rare access to Trump as a leading Democrat underscores the political and economic stakes as the president considers escalating tariffs further.",
