Trump\u2019s executive order to end birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally has been halted nationwide by three district courts around the country. The Republican administration had sought to narrow those orders to allow for the policy to take effect in parts or most of the country. That is expected to be the focus of the high court arguments under the court's order Thursday.",

That's according to officials in Belize and the U.S. After the plane carrying 14 passengers and two crew members landed safely on Thursday, police in Belize identified the man as Akinyela Taylor. Chester Williams, Belize police commissioner, said that Taylor wielded a knife and stabbed three people on the plane. The three were later taken to a hospital. A passenger licensed to carry firearms shot the hijacker. A U.S. Embassy spokesperson confirmed Taylor was a U.S. citizen but U.S. officials could not confirm a Belize commissioner's statement that he was a military veteran. The hijacker's motive was not immediately known.",

A Los Angeles judge said Thursday that discussions over the admissibility of the state parole board\u2019s risk assessments will be considered during a new hearing on May 9. The brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life without parole for killing their parents in 1989. Defense attorneys argued they acted in self-defense after years of abuse. Prosecutors said they killed their parents for the inheritance. The resentencing hearing will focus on whether they have been rehabilitated and deserve a lesser sentence.",

The meeting on Thursday marks the first face-to-face between a European leader and the U.S. president since he announced, and then temporarily suspended, tariffs of 20% on European exports. Meloni is traveling in her role as Italy\u2019s leader, but she has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen ahead of the trip. The 90-day pause on the retaliatory tariffs has raised some hopes for negotiation, and experts say that Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in bringing clarity on Trump's goals than in outright concessions.",

The Department of Homeland Security ordered Harvard late Tuesday to turn over detailed records of the school's foreign student visa holders\u2019 \"illegal and violent activities\u201d by April 30. The move deepens the crackdown on Harvard. On Monday, it became the first university to openly defy the administration\u2019s demands related to activism on campus, antisemitism and diversity.
