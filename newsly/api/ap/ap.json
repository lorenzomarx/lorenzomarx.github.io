The date of the conclave was chief on the agenda of cardinals holding informal meetings to hash out church business following the April 21 death of Pope Francis. They held off on announcing the opening of the conclave until after his funeral on Saturday. The Vatican said more than 180 participated in the fifth informal meeting in Rome on Monday. A smaller group of 135, known as the College of Cardinals, is eligible to elect a new pope.",

Investigators have ruled out terrorism and say he has a history of mental health issues. Those killed were between the ages of 5 and 65. Dozens were injured when a man driving an SUV struck people attending the Lapu Lapu Day festival on Saturday.",

It has cut off the territory\u2019s 2 million Palestinians from all imports, including food and medicine, since the beginning of March in what it says is an attempt to pressure the militant group to release hostages.

The date for the conclave has not yet been set but it can only begin after a nine-day period of mourning. When it does, the scarlet-robed cardinals will enter solemnly to participate in a secretive process said to be guided by the holy spirit that will result in the selection of the next leader of the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic church. For inspiration they will also have the great beauty of the frescos painted by Michelangelo and other renowned Renaissance artists.",

They\u2019ll pick either Prime Minister Mark Carney or opposition leader Pierre Poilievre to lead the way forward, but Monday's election is also a referendum of sorts on a non-Canadian: Donald Trump. Until the American president won a second term and began threatening Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty, even suggesting the country should become the 51st state, the Liberals looked headed for defeat. But Trump\u2019s truculence has infuriated many Canadians and led to a tightening of the race. Whichever candidate becomes prime minister will face big challenges, including a trade war and resetting of Canada's relationship with the United States.",

      "description": "A violin made in 1941 inside the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau was found to contain a hidden note from its maker, Polish Jewish prisoner Franciszek Kempa. Discovered by Hungarian art dealers decades later, the note explained the instrument was crafted under dire conditions with no proper tools or wood. Experts were struck by the contrast between the violin\u2019s masterful construction and its poor materials. Kempa\u2019s violin is believed to be the only known instrument built within Dachau, where most surviving instruments were brought in by prisoners. Dubbed the \u201cviolin of hope,\u201d it stands as a testament to resilience. Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp, was liberated in 1945 after at least 40,000 deaths.",
