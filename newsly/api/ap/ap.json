      "description": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revise the Pentagon\u2019s policy on transgender troops. It is likely to set in motion a future ban on their military service. Trump had tried to impose a ban on transgender troops during his first term, but it was tangled up in the courts for years before being overturned by then-President Joe Biden shortly after he took office. Lawyers for transgender troops who challenged the ban in the courts during Trump\u2019s first term have already pledged to fight the new ban.",

      "description": "At least 56 senior officials in the top U.S. aid and development agency have been placed on leave amid an investigation into an alleged effort to thwart President Donald Trump\u2019s orders. U.S. Agency for International Development acting head Jason Gray said Monday in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press that the move was part of an investigation into possible efforts at the agency to thwart Trump's orders. A current official and a former official at USAID recounted the actions on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. The move comes as a sweeping foreign assistance funding freeze by Trump was beginning to shut down U.S.-funded projects around the world.",

      "description": "The Trump Justice Department says it has fired more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal investigations into President Donald Trump. The abrupt action targeting career prosecutors who worked on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team is the latest sign of upheaval inside the Justice Department. It reflects the administration\u2019s determination to purge the government of workers it perceives as disloyal to the president. The move, which follows the reassignment of multiple senior career officials across divisions, was made even though rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain in their positions across presidential administrations and are not punished because of their involvement in sensitive investigations.",

DeepSeek\u2019s AI assistant became the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone store Monday, propelled by curiosity about the ChatGPT competitor. Part of what\u2019s worrying some U.S. tech industry observers is the idea that the Chinese startup has caught up with the American companies at the forefront of generative AI at a fraction of the cost.

Analysts say the M23 fighters aim to control the city of about 2 million people and perhaps other areas in the region nearly 1,000 miles from the Congolese capital. It marks a sharp escalation in one of Africa\u2019s longest wars, threatening to dramatically worsen a dire humanitarian crisis and spill into a wider regional conflict. The rebels\u2019 offensive has sent thousands fleeing their homes and stretched local hospitals to the limit, with hundreds of wounded coming in every day.",

The 15-month war, which has killed more than 47,000 people and displaced most of the population of 2.3 million, left a health system in shambles and large swaths of the territory reduced to rubble. A shortage of clean water and damaged sewer systems have spurred worries over the spread of infectious disease. Now aid groups are rushing to provide food and supplies amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas while planning the best way forward.",
