      "description": "At least 22 children were killed in Gaza overnight Tuesday and early Wednesday in a punishing series of Israeli airstrikes on homes in northern Gaza. The strikes killed at least 48 people in total, the Indonesian Hospital in Jabaliya reported. The strikes came a day after Hamas released an Israeli-American hostage in a deal brokered by the United States, and as President Donald Trump was visiting Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was \u201cno way\u201d Israel would halt its war in Gaza, dimming hopes for a ceasefire.",

Officials said his visa was revoked because of his social media posts and his wife\u2019s connection to Gaza as a Palestinian American.

The brothers' resentencing Tuesday for the 1989 murder of their parents, and the possibility that they'll go free, comes at time of similar cultural obsession, reflected by true-crime documentaries and docudramas. The initial trial was the first major case aired on Court TV, and came just before the O.J. Simpson trial made televised murder trials much bigger. The Menendez brothers had mostly faded from memory, but two Netflix shows brought renewed attention to their case.",

The agency, however, will keep limits on the two most common types, called PFOA and PFOS, although it will offer a two-year deadline extension for utilities to comply. PFAS are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and are incredibly useful in household products, but that resilience also makes them hazardous.",

The Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to place a new amendment on the statewide ballot that would instead impose a ban on most abortions, with exceptions for rape and incest. The vote came after the GOP majority used a rare procedural move to cut off debate by Democrats who opposed the measure. The new referendum would go before voters in November 2026 unless Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election sooner than that.",

An estimated 80,000 people died from an overdose 2024. That\u2019s down 27% from the 110,000 in 2023. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released the data Wednesday. The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018. Experts say several things could be driving the decline. They include increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, expanded addiction treatment and shifts in how people use drugs.",
