Trump on Tuesday will give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. Some Americans fear for the country\u2019s future after the Republican president\u2019s aggressive early moves, while others cheer him on. Democrats are highlighting the impact of Trump\u2019s actions by inviting as guests fired federal workers and people who\u2019d be harmed by cuts to Medicaid and other programs.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump will stand at the front of the U.S. House chamber to address a joint session of Congress, the first of his second term in office. But Tuesday night's address won't be called the State of the Union. The president's first-year speech is called something else: a joint address to Congress. The term has its origins in the first term of President Ronald Reagan. According to the American Presidency Project, the impacts of these first-year speeches should be considered to have the same heft as the State of the Union addresses that follow in subsequent years.",

In an amended lawsuit filed late Monday, AP says the White House has doubled down on retaliating against the news outlet for its refusal to rename the Gulf of Mexico. A federal judge last week rejected AP's first bid for an injunction, but urged the White House to reconsider because case law stood against it. The amended lawsuit cited the White House's decision to take full control over which journalists are allowed in pools that cover smaller events. The Trump administration did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday.",

      "description": "The U.S. has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began three years ago. The suspension of that aid by the Trump administration doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine\u2019s defenses will quickly collapse. But it's a major blow that threatens to remove some of the most formidable weapons in Ukraine\u2019s battlefield arsenal. And it ratchets up pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace agreement. The U.S. provides about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s military supplies. And it includes the most lethal and important equipment like longer-range missiles and Patriot air defense systems. Malcolm Chalmers of the RUSI think tank says much will depend on whether the U.S. cuts off technical assistance as well as weapons and ammunition.",

Mayors from Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York will appear Wednesday before the Committee on Oversight and Government Accountability over their cities' policies restricting authorities' cooperation with federal enforcement. These are often referred to as \u201csanctuary policies\u201d and the localities as \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d Courts have upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws. But Trump administration officials have targeted sanctuary policies, seeing them as a key impediment to deporting people in the large numbers he wants. New York\u2019s mayor says he hopes for a \u201ccivil conversation\u201d with the representatives.",

The virus is spreading among Gaines County\u2019s Mennonite community, where government mandates are not trusted. But another outbreak is also spreading, and that's mistrust in vaccines and public health. Most parents have chosen to vaccinate, but doctors worry anti-vaccine rhetoric from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s top health official, will make things worse as childhood vaccination rates decline. Gaines County has an 82% kindergarten vaccination rate against measles, below the 95% needed to stop outbreaks. The rate may be even lower among homeschooled children.",

Starting just past midnight Tuesday, imports from Canada and Mexico are now taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. In addition, the 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%. China retaliated Tuesday with additional tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports, among other measures. Canada also has announced tariffs on American goods. Trump's moves have raised inflation fears, even as he has promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity.",

That step came days after a disastrous Oval Office row that has deepened a rift between Kyiv and the White House. U.S. President Donald Trump directed the U.S. to pause all assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in peace talks with Russia. Ukraine, which depends heavily on foreign help to hold back the Russian invasion that began on Feb. 24 2022, Kyiv has feared the possibility of aid being stopped to Ukraine ever since Trump took office.",
