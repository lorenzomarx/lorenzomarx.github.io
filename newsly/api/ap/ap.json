Israeli officials say that the bodies belong to Ronen Engel and Sonthaya Oakkharasri. They were killed during Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel has threatened on Sunday to keep the Rafah border crossing closed until Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning all deceased hostages. Hamas has handed over the remains of 13 bodies. Eleven of them have been identified as hostages. Israel said one of the bodies released didn't belong to a hostage. The Palestinian group said that talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.",

They forced a window, smashed display cases, and fled with jewels of \"inestimable value,\" according to France's interior minister. The museum closed for the day as police sealed gates and ushered visitors out. The robbery took place in the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, where part of the French Crown Jewels are displayed. The thieves reportedly took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon and the Empress. Security and staffing at the Louvre have been under scrutiny.",

The Trump administration has cut state grants and tied funding to immigration enforcement. And the government shutdown adds to the problem. Last week, a federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop linking grants to immigration enforcement. Some states have seen drastic cuts to homeland security grants, leading to a freeze on the entire $1 billion program. Emergency management agencies are delaying hiring and equipment purchases. Experts warn these disruptions could jeopardize preparedness and response to disasters.",

      "description": "Bolivia is about to swing to the right after almost two decades of being governed by the Movement Toward Socialism party. The question that voters must answer in Sunday\u2019s presidential runoff is how far to the right and how fast. The two front-runners from the August election facing off in this second round are former right-wing president Jorge \u201cTuto \u201dQuiroga and centrist senator Rodrigo Paz. Both are conservative and business-friendly candidates. But they have different ideas about how to dig Bolivia out of its worst economic crisis in 40 years. The Andean nation is crippled by a shortage of U.S. dollars. Imports are scarce. Inflation has soared. And fuel lines paralyze the country.",

The duke\u2019s demise began in 2019 following a disastrous interview in which Andrew sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and denied allegations he had sex with a 17-year-old Giuffre.",
