      "description": "A planned meeting between European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has abruptly canceled due to \u201cscheduling issues.\u201d It comes as political tensions have increased between Europe and the United States. Both sides blamed scheduling challenges, but European officials said they were caught off-guard. Notably, Kallas had previewed her planned talks with Rubio to reporters in Brussels just two days ago. The cancellation also came after the State Department instructed U.S. diplomats to step up demands on Europe to protect free speech and end what the Trump administration says are loose migration policies.",

      "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s demand that federal agencies plan to radically downsize is driven by a key figure in the conservative movement who has long planned this move. In President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, Russell Vought was largely a behind-the-scenes player who eventually became director of the influential but underappreciated Office of Management and Budget. He is back in that job in Trump\u2019s second term after being the principal author of Project 2025, the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda.",

Ukraine and its European allies have been scrambling to respond after the Trump administration engaged directly with Moscow to quickly end the war in Ukraine. Starmer has announced a big boost in U.K. defense spending and offered to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a force to safeguard a ceasefire. He says an American \u201cbackstop\u201d will be needed to ensure a lasting peace. Trump hasn\u2019t committed to providing security guarantees for Ukraine. The trip comes after Washington and Kyiv struck an economic deal giving the U.S. a share of Ukraine\u2019s lucrative rare earth mineral deposits.",

The outcome of the case could remove an additional requirement that some courts apply when members of a majority group, including those who are white and heterosexual, sue for discrimination under federal law. The justices heard arguments in an appeal from Marlean Ames, who has worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years. Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the court say workplace discrimination \u201cwhether you are gay or straight, is prohibited. The rules are the same whichever way it goes.\u201d",

Agency leaders must submit their plans by March 13. Trump is setting the stage for what could become a dramatic realignment of the federal government. He's already downsized the workforce by laying off probationary employees. Now the administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection. Trump foreshadowed this goal in an executive order that he signed with Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who's advising the Republican president on overhauling the government.",

Hamas handed over the bodies late Wednesday, and Israel was set to release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, days before the first phase of their ceasefire will end. Israel has delayed the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it called the cruel treatment of hostages during their handover by Hamas. The militant group has called the delay a \u201cserious violation\u201d of the ceasefire and said talks on a second phase aren\u2019t possible until the Palestinians are freed. The handover would complete both sides\u2019 obligations under the ceasefire\u2019s first phase.",

EB-5s were created by Congress in 1990 to generate foreign investment and are available to people who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people. Lutnick says the Republican president's gold card would raise the price of admission for investors and eliminate fraud. The gold card is actually a green card, or permanent legal residency.",
