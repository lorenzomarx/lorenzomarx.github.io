      "description": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in London. The visit Thursday follows Zelenskyy's virtual meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders a day earlier. Trump assured the leaders he would prioritize a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, called the discussions constructive. However, some Ukrainians remain skeptical about achieving meaningful progress. Meanwhile, Russian strikes in Ukraine's Sumy and Kherson regions have injured several people, including children.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting in Alaska with Vladimir Putin could be a decisive moment in the war in Ukraine and in the U.S. leader\u2019s anomalous relationship with his Russian counterpart. Trump has long boasted that he\u2019s always gotten along well with Putin and spoken admiringly of him, even praising him as \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine. But in recent months, he\u2019s expressed open frustrations with Putin and called him \u201cCRAZY\u201d while threatening to impose sanctions on Russia. Still, Trump\u2019s self-imposed deadline for sanctions came and went without any announced penalties or explanation from the White House and the Republican president, tempering expectations for their Friday summit.",

      "description": "Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister has announced a contentious new settlement construction in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which Palestinians and rights groups worry will scuttle plans for a future Palestinian state by effectively cutting the West Bank into two separate parts. The announcement comes as many countries said they would recognize a Palestinian state in September. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said, \u201cThis reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize.\u201d",

      "description": "For most of his quarter-century rule, President Vladimir Putin visited places like Paris, London, Vienna and New York. Since Moscow invaded Ukraine, however, his destinations have been Beijing, Pyongyang, Hanoi and Minsk as the West sought to turn Russia into a pariah. The trip to Alaska will be Putin\u2019s first to the U.S. since 2015, when he attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Russia has countered Western attempts to isolate it by bolstering its ties with ex-Soviet allies and other developing countries. Putin\u2019s travel also has been limited by an International Criminal Court arrest warrant from 2023 that prompted him to avoid visits to places that recognize the court\u2019s authority.",

      "description": "President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 90 years ago this week, aiming to provide economic stability for older Americans. Today, the program supports nearly 69 million people monthly but faces significant challenges. Social Security is projected to run out of money to pay full benefits by 2034. Recent legislation and tax changes have accelerated this timeline. Discussions about privatizing Social Security have resurfaced, with some experts suggesting benefit reductions for wealthier retirees. Public confidence in the program's future is waning, and debates continue about potential reforms to ensure its sustainability.",

      "description": "A Rhode Island man accused of faking his death and fleeing the United States to evade rape charges has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a former girlfriend in his first of two Utah trials. A jury in Salt Lake County found Nicholas Rossi guilty of a 2008 rape after a three-day trial. He is to be sentenced on Oct. 20. An obituary published online claimed Rossi had died on Feb. 29, 2020, of late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead. He was arrested in Scotland the following year and extradited to Utah in January 2024.",

      "description": "Florida shifted to virtual learning for youth in juvenile detention \u2014 and parents and students say it's been a disaster. The state adopted this approach for incarcerated youth, despite evidence that online learners struggled during the pandemic. Officials said they chose Florida Virtual School, known for its rigorous standards, in part to help students reintegrate into public schools. But students find the coursework difficult to understand. They say they have little support from qualified teachers, and their special education plans aren't being met. This frustration often leads to behavioral issues, extending students' time in detention, sometimes by months or more.",

      "description": "Some cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been drawing attention because they have wart-like growths on their faces that look like horns. The rabbits are infected with the relatively common Shope papillomavirus. The virus likely inspired the centuries-old jackalope myth. It also helped scientists learn about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer. Experts say the virus cannot spread to other species. The growths don\u2019t harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits\u2019 immune systems are able to fight the virus. And once they do, the growths will disappear.",
