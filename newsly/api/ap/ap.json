      "description": "Up all night, House Republicans voted pre-dawn to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending cuts package. The House is now starting a round of debates ahead of a final vote expected later Thursday morning. GOP leaders worked almost around the clock trying to persuade skeptical holdouts. Trump worked the phones as Republicans race to send the bill to his desk by the Fourth of July deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson had recalled lawmakers to Washington, eager to seize on the momentum of the 887-page bill's passage the day before in the Senate. Some GOP lawmakers are criticizing the legislation as straying from the party's fiscal goals. Johnson expects votes later Thursday morning.",

      "description": "There\u2019s no filibuster in the House, but Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries essentially conducted one anyway. Jeffries held the House floor for more than eight hours on Thursday, taking his \u201csweet time\u201d with a marathon floor speech that delayed passage of Republicans\u2019 massive tax and spending cuts legislation. The marathon speech gave his party a lengthy spotlight to excoriate what he called an \u201cimmoral\u201d bill from Republicans. The speech pushed a final vote on the tax bill, initially expected in the early morning, into the daylight hours. Republicans who were sitting on the floor when Jeffries started trickled out, leaving half the chamber empty.",

When the Labor Department on Thursday releases job numbers for last month, they\u2019re expected to show that businesses, government agencies and nonprofits added 115,000 jobs in June, down from 139,000 in May. The unemployment rate is expected to have ticked up to 4.3%, which would be the highest since October 2021. The U.S. job market has cooled considerably from the red-hot days of 2021-2023. So far this year employers have added an average 124,000 jobs a month, down from 168,000 in 2024 and a 2021-2023 average of 400,000.",

The justices said Thursday they will review lower court-rulings in favor of transgender athletes in Idaho and West Virginia. The case highlights a broader national debate over transgender rights, with more than two dozen states enacting laws restricting transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports. Some of these laws have been blocked in court. The issue has become a focal point in legislative and legal battles over the inclusion of transgender individuals in public life.",

      "description": "A startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology. The company says its patented particles grow algae that trap carbon dioxide, which then sinks to the ocean floor. Outside scientists, however, question the effectiveness and environmental impact of this method, citing a lack of public data and concerns about marine ecosystems. Gigablue has conducted trials in New Zealand and plans to expand operations. While some buyers trust the company\u2019s promises, experts remain skeptical about its unproven technology and the broader implications of such ocean-based carbon removal efforts.",
