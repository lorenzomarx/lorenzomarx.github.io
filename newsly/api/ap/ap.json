      "description": "President Donald Trump has signed an order to impose stiff tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, fulfilling a campaign promise but raising the prospect of trade conflict and increased prices for American consumers. Trump is declaring an economic emergency to put duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada \u2014 America\u2019s largest trading partners \u2014 except for a 10% rate on Canadian oil. The White House said Trump\u2019s order also includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if the countries retaliate against the U.S., as they have threatened. Trump says the tariffs are to force the countries to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",

      "description": "Tariffs are in the news at the moment. But what are they? Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs.",

Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20.

Tuesday\u2019s meeting at the White House will be Trump\u2019s first with a foreign leader since returning to office.

Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, has said it will not release many of the remaining hostages without an end to the war.",

That's according to two people familiar with the situation.

Senate Finance Committee member Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday. He expressed concern that \u201cofficials associated with Musk may have intended to access these payment systems to illegally withhold payments to any number of programs.\u201d",
