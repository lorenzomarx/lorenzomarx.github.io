      "description": "At least 82 people were killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza on Friday, as US President Donald Trump wrapped up his regional trip. Strikes overnight and into Friday hit across Gaza, including the outskirts of Deir al-Balah and the city of Khan Younis. At least 66 people were killed according to the Indonesian hospital, where most of the bodies were taken. A further 16 bodies were taken to Nasser hospital, said health officials. The widespread attacks across northern Gaza come as Trump finishes his visit to Gulf states but not Israel. There had been widespread hope that Trump\u2019s regional visit could usher in a ceasefire deal or renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza.",

      "description": "Delegations from Russia and Ukraine have met in Istanbul for their first direct peace talks in three years. A Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov sat down Friday with a low-level Russian team headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. That's according to Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson who published a photo of the meeting. The officials present sat around a U-shaped table, with the Russians and Ukrainians facing each other. Officials and observers expect the Turkish-brokered talks to yield little immediate progress on stopping the more than three-year war.",

Trump made the comment aboard Air Force One as he ended his trip to the United Arab Emirates, the last stop on his three-nation tour of the Middle East. Trump did not elaborate on the substance of the proposal and Iran did not immediately acknowledge having it. On Thursday, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke to journalists at the Tehran International Book Fair and said that Iran did not have any proposal from the Americans yet.",

His four-day swing through Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates puts a spotlight on Trump\u2019s transactional approach to foreign affairs as he was feted by autocratic rulers. His trip played out against the backdrop of stubborn global conflicts that showed the limits of his influence. But Trump insisted he was turning the page on American \u201cinterventionalism\u201d as he moved to recognize the new government in Syria for the first time and prodded Iran to engage on nuclear talks.",

But renegade conservatives have warned they'll vote against it Friday without further changes. Tallying a whopping 1,116 pages, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is teetering at a critical moment. Conservatives are holding out for steeper cuts to Medicaid and other programs to help offset the costs of the tax breaks. Lawmakers from high-tax states including New York are demanding a deeper local tax deduction. House Speaker Mike Johnson insists Republicans are on track with the bill he says will shore up the economy.",
