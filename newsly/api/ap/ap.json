      "description": "President-elect Donald Trump says he talked with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about TikTok shortly before the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the federal law banning the app beginning Sunday unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company. The court held Friday the risk to national security posed by TikTok's ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the U.S. A sale does not appear imminent. The court\u2019s decision means new users won\u2019t be able to download the app and updates won\u2019t be available, but it won\u2019t disappear from users\u2019 phones. Trump had called on the court to keep the ban on hold until after he takes office Monday.",

      "description": "President Joe Biden won\u2019t enforce a ban on the social media app TikTok that is set to take effect a day before he leaves office, a U.S. official says. That leaves TikTok's fate in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump. Congress last year in a law signed by Biden required that TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company ByteDance divest the company by Jan. 19. Trump, who once called to ban the app, has since pledged to keep it available in the U.S., though his transition team has not said how they intend to accomplish that. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration.",

The conversation comes ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday. The U.S.-China relationship is expected to be one of the main focuses of Trump\u2019s second term, with tensions between the two superpowers looming in the areas of trade, technology and the self-ruled island of Taiwan, among other things. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% on all Chinese imports into the U.S. But he has also in the past praised his relationship with Xi and has suggested China could help mediate international crises such as the war in Ukraine.",

Some experts think established social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, could see the biggest influx of users.

Many were trapped and became emaciated from lack of food. Dozens died and their bodies were wrapped in twine and set aside in rows. The miner spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. A long-awaited rescue operation this week retrieved bodies and brought out more than 240 survivors. Police targeted the mineshaft as part of an operation to tackle the widespread illegal mining trade that bled the South African economy of $3 billion last year.",

The ERA is a 1970s-era prohibition on discrimination based on gender, guaranteeing men and women equal rights under the law. As a constitutional amendment, it needs ratification from three-quarters of the states before it\u2019s added to the U.S. Constitution. The Democratic president's move Friday is largely symbolic. Presidents don\u2019t have any role in the amendment process. And the leader of the National Archives has said the amendment cannot be certified because it wasn\u2019t ratified before a deadline set by Congress.",

If the cabinet approves, the deal will then go to the government for final sign off before the ceasefire goes into effect. Friday's meeting comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said earlier there were last minute snags in finalizing the agreement. However, a pre-dawn statement Friday by Israel\u2019s government, appeared to clear the way for Israeli approval for the deal. U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced the deal on Wednesday, which is aimed at releasing scores of hostages held in Gaza and winding down the war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.",

The bill would also give states new power to legally challenge federal immigration policies. It sets a new tone on immigration restrictions in the Republican-controlled Congress as Donald Trump enters the White House. The Senate Republican majority has made the so-called Laken Riley Act a top priority. It was named after a Georgia student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man, and may become the first bill Trump signs as president. On Friday, it cleared a key procedural hurdle.",
