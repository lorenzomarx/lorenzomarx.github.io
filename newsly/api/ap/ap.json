      "description": "Texas Democrats have left the state in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. The dramatic move Sunday could expose Democrats to fines and other penalties. Democrats have cast the decision to leave the state as a last-ditch effort to stop Republicans from pushing through a rare mid-decade redrawing of the congressional map. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature that started last month to take up the redistricting effort that President Donald Trump has urged.",

      "description": "Boeing workers who build fighter jets are planning to go on strike. About 3,200 workers at facilities in St. Louis and other locations voted to reject a modified four-year labor agreement with Boeing. That is according to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union. The union says its workers deserve nothing less than a contract that keeps their families secure and recognizes their unmatched expertise. Boeing says the company is disappointed its employees rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth and resolved issues about work schedules.",

A faction of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the March 22, 2024, massacre at the Crocus City Hall concert venue in which four gunmen shot people who were waiting for a show by a popular rock band and then set the building on fire. President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have claimed, without presenting evidence, that Ukraine had a role in the attack. Kyiv has strongly denied any involvement.",

Israel\u2019s blockade and military offensive have made it nearly impossible to safely deliver aid. That's contributing to the territory\u2019s slide toward famine nearly 22 months into the war with Hamas. Aid groups say Israel\u2019s week-old measures to allow more aid in are far from sufficient. Families of hostages in Gaza fear starvation affects them too, but blame Hamas. The U.N. says several hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since May while seeking food aid.",

Trump has set a Friday deadline for Russia to stop its aggression or face severe economic penalties. The diplomatic stalemate remains challenging, with Ukraine losing territory but showing no signs of a defense collapse. Trump has expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of sanctions, while Russia continues its military advancements.

The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company\u2019s CEO. In December Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.",

      "description": "Recent moves in Ecuador have environmental interests concerned that the South American nation is unwinding some of the basis for its green reputation. President Daniel Noboa has eliminated the Environment Ministry as an independent institution, folding it into the Energy and Mines Ministry. Activists and Indigenous leaders say the move weakens protections for some of the world\u2019s most biodiverse areas and paves the way for expanded oil and mining projects. They also warn that a proposed law ostensibly aimed at choking off money for illegal mining and organized crime will actually cause serious harm to nonprofits. The government argues the changes will improve efficiency and curb illicit financing.",

      "description": "Scientists have solved the mystery of what killed over 5 billion sea stars \u2014 also known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America. Starting in 2013, a wasting disease caused a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species. The sunflower sea star was worst hit, losing around 90% of its population. Researchers have identified the culprit as a bacterium that also infects shellfish. The findings, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, could help scientists intervene to save sea stars. This is crucial for Pacific ecosystems, as healthy starfish control sea urchin populations that threaten kelp forests.",
