      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s vision of the Supreme Court, in which his three appointees are personally loyal to him, collided with the court\u2019s view of itself when six justices voted to strike down Trump\u2019s signature economic policy, global tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law. The outcome Friday led Trump to launch an unusually personal attack on the justices, with special rancor reserved for the two Trump appointees who defied him. Trump said he was \u201cabsolutely ashamed\u201d of some justices \"for not having the courage to do what\u2019s right for the country.\u201d He spoke in the White House briefing room several hours after the court issued its decision, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump suffered a rare rebuke when the Supreme Court ruled against his tariff agenda. The decision Friday throws U.S. trade policy back into uncertainty. Trump has built his economic message around tariffs and the deals that he says they force. He argues they bring factories and jobs back. He also warns that losing them harms the economy. Trump called the ruling \u201cridiculous\u201d and said he is looking for other laws to keep tariffs in place. Democrats say the decision proves Trump broke the law. Polling from AP-NORC finds that most adults oppose tariffs and expect higher prices.",

Trump says he\u2019s \u201cabsolutely ashamed\u201d of justices who voted to strike down his tariffs, calling the decision \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d Friday's 6-3 decision centers on tariffs he unilaterally imposed under an emergency powers law, including the sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs levied on nearly every other country. Trump has called the case one of the most important in U.S. history. The new tariffs would come under a law that restricts them to 150 days.",

It had been flipping between small gains and losses before the court\u2019s ruling, following discouraging reports showing slowing growth for the U.S. economy and faster inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%. Trading was tentative across markets after the ruling and after Trump pledged to put tariffs on other countries using other avenues. Treasury yields largely held steady in the bond market.",

The death of 23-year-old Ruben Ray Martinez occurred in March on South Padre Island and was reported by local media outlets at the time. But authorities did not publicly disclose that the shooting involved a team from Homeland Security Investigations conducting an immigration enforcement operation in conjunction with local police. Details of the shooting first emerged this month among heavily redacted internal documents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.",

The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants who shouldn\u2019t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August.",

Principal Alonna McMullen says it was heartbreaking telling 5 and 6 year old students in Linda Davis' special needs classes of her death. The crash happened Monday less than a half mile from the school where Davis taught in Savannah's southern suburbs. Authorities say the driver was a Guatemalan man who crashed after running a stoplight to evade immigration officers seeking to detain him on a judge's deportation order. McMullen said Davis had an upbeat personality and a determination to ensure all of her students thrived.",

The full court voted 12-6 to lift a block placed on the law that a lower court first issued in 2024. In the opinion released Friday, the court said it was too early to make a judgment call on the constitutionality of the law. But the six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, some arguing that the case was ripe for judicial review and others saying that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.",
