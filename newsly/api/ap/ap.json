      "description": "The voters in early presidential nominating states are used to seeing contenders months or even years before most of the country. But the political jockeying in 2025 for the 2028 presidential contest appears to be playing out earlier, with more frequency and with less pretense than ever before. While the first presidential primary votes won\u2019t be cast for another two and a half years, three Democratic presidential prospects are scheduled to campaign in South Carolina for 10 days this month.

The interior ministry said Monday that military forces will deploy to restore order. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 37 deaths and said the violence began after kidnappings and robberies escalated tensions between Druze and Sunni Bedouin groups. The ministry called the situation a dangerous escalation fueled by the absence of effective governance. Sweida is home to Syria\u2019s Druze minority and has seen unrest since the fall of former leader Bashar Assad, with Druze factions divided over integrating with the new government.",

Chinese shares advanced after the government reported that exports rose last month as a truce in a tariffs war prompted a surge in orders ahead of an August deadline for reaching a new trade deal with Washington. An announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump that he plans 30% tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union had scant immediate impact, as analysts said they expected progress toward trade deals before an Aug. 1 deadline. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 0.3% and the Dow industrials gave back 0.6%. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%.",
