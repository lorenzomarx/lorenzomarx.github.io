      "description": "Authorities are searching for evidence after a man with a makeshift flamethrower yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and hurled an incendiary device into a group that had assembled to raise attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza. Eight people were injured in the Sunday attack, some with burns. The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was booked into the Boulder County jail north of Denver and expected to face charges in connection with the attack the FBI was investigating as a terrorist act. The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions.",

Expectations are low for any significant progress Monday on ending the three-year war after a string of major attacks over the weekend. Ukraine said Sunday it launched a spectacular surprise attack on five Russian airbases thousands of kilometers apart, ranging from air bases close to Moscow to targets in Russia\u2019s Arctic, Siberia, and Far East. Ukraine claimed more than 40 Russian warplanes were destroyed in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called a \u201cbrilliant operation.\u201d Meanwhile, Russia on Sunday launched the biggest number of drones \u2014 472 \u2014 on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in February 2022.",

The justices on Monday turned down a case against a decade-old Maryland law similar to those in several other states. The decision comes three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights. Gun advocates and attorneys for Maryland disagree over whether the AR-15 and similar weapons are protected by the Second Amendment.",

The health secretary asserts children with autism will never pay taxes, hold a job or go out on a date. For some families, Kennedy\u2019s remarks are an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresents the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder. Kennedy plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, a complex developmental disorder.",

The Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals confirmed the toll from Monday\u2019s strike in the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp, saying five women and seven children were among those killed. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militant group is entrenched in populated areas.",

The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.

Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought. The latest study puts the chance of a collision at 50-50 within the next 10 billion years. That's essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time. Past theories put a galaxy collision as probable if not inevitable. The findings appear in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
