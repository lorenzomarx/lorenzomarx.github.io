      "description": "European Union leaders are appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to defend their security interests at a key summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. The Europeans are desperate to exert some influence over a meeting that they have been sidelined from. It's unclear whether whether even Ukraine will take part. Trump says he wants to see on Friday whether Putin is serious about ending the war. But he has disappointed U.S. allies by saying that Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. In a statement early Tuesday, the EU leaders welcomed his efforts to end the war, but insisted that \u201cthe path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d",

      "description": "Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has responded to President Donald Trump's plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard. Bowser emphasized that crime has been dropping and Trump's state of emergency doesn't match the numbers. She acknowledged that the city has little choice but to comply. Bowser linked the takeover to the larger issue of D.C. statehood, stating that limited autonomy makes the city vulnerable. Trump's decision fits a pattern of using emergency declarations to rule by executive order. Bowser maintains that violent crime has decreased, a claim supported by Trump's former U.S. attorney nominee.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hinting that ceasefire efforts are now focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages in Gaza all at once. Arab officials told The Associated Press last week that mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new framework for a deal that would include the release of all hostages in one go in return for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The long-running indirect talks appeared to break down last month. But Egyptian state-run media reports that a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for talks on Tuesday.",

Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the next commissioner at the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni\u2019s nomination has been met with a cascade of criticism from other economists, from across the political spectrum. His selection threatens to bring a new level of politicization to what for decades has been a nonpartisan agency widely accepted as a producer of reliable measures of the nation\u2019s economic health. While many former Labor Department officials say it it unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented.",

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows confirmed the plans Tuesday during a brief session that marked another failure to meet the required attendance standards. Dozens of Democrats have left the state and left the GOP majority unable to move forward with its gerrymandering attempt. Burrows said lawmakers will not reconvene again until Friday. If Democrats are still absent, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he will end the current session and will call another.",

Siberian fur traders arrived from across the Bering Sea in the first part of the 18th century, and the imprint of Russian settlement in Alaska remains. The oldest building in Anchorage is a Russian Orthodox church, and many Alaska Natives have Russian surnames. But Alaska has been U.S. territory since 1867. Some observers say it is a bad choice for a summit on the Russia-Ukraine war because it sends a message that territory can change hands.",
