      "description": "Donald Trump has given voters a hefty list of promises, and many of them come due right away. On many major issues, Trump promises to deliver on Day 1. The Republican said during his presidential campaign he'll issue first-day pardons for some of the rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump says he'll launch the largest deportation in U.S. history, declare a national emergency to spur the approval of energy projects and end birthright citizenship. But there's only so much Trump can do without Congress, and some of his Day 1 vows are bound to fall short.",

      "description": "The super-rich have long played a role in U.S. politics but have an unusually prominent spot in incoming President Donald Trump's new administration. President Joe Biden's farewell warning about a tech-fueled \u201coligarchy\u201d is due to that. Biden and his fellow Democrats have also long been supported by billionaires, but not in the same direct way or with the same dynamics of threats and demands for loyalty that come from Trump. The use of the term \u201coligarchy\u201d harkens to Russian politics.",

Elon Musk\u2019s company confirmed the loss just minutes into the flight from the southern tip of Texas. The spacecraft\u2019s engines shut down one by one, and contact soon was lost. SpaceX says it will take time to figure out what went wrong. The trouble arose just a minute after the first-stage booster returned to the launch pad and was captured by giant mechanical arms. It was the seventh test flight for the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful rocket.",

      "description": "The yield on the 10-year Treasury has recently soared toward its highest level since 2023, injecting nervousness into the U.S. stock market that's knocked indexes from their records. The bond market's moves might seem strange given that the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates three times since September. But it\u2019s a reminder that investors care more about the future than the present. And the bond market is currently worried about potentially higher inflation and a U.S. economy that may not need more help from easier interest rates. That\u2019s hurting the stock market.",

That leaves TikTok's fate in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump. Congress last year in a law signed by Biden required that TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company ByteDance divest the company by Jan. 19. Trump, who once called to ban the app, has since pledged to keep it available in the U.S., though his transition team has not said how they intend to accomplish that.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a last-minute dispute with Hamas is holding up Israeli approval. Hamas denied the claims. Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet vote on the agreement that had been scheduled for Thursday until Friday, at the earliest. Netanyahu signaled complications with the deal shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 72 people in the war-ravaged territory.",

Blackened shells of buildings and mounds of rubble stretch away in all directions. Major roads have been plowed up. Critical water and electricity infrastructure is in ruins.

The states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri can now move ahead with their efforts in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas, where a nominee of former President Donald Trump is the only judge. The states want the courts to prohibit telehealth prescriptions of the pill and to limit its use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy. It\u2019s a narrower challenge than the case brought by a group of anti-abortion doctors.
