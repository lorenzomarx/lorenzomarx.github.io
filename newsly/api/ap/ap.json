      "description": "Several NATO allies are insisting that Ukraine and Europe must not be cut out of any peace negotiations, after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled that he would hold talks soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey said Thursday that \u201cUkraine\u2019s voice must be at the heart of any talks.\u201d The United States has rattled NATO by saying that Ukraine should never join and that European allies should take responsibility for Ukraine's security. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said that Europe has driven sanctions against Russia, invested heavily in Ukraine\u2019s defense, and will have to foot the bill for reconstruction. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth denied that the United States is betraying Ukraine.",

      "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says NATO membership for Ukraine is unrealistic. In sweeping remarks Wednesday, Hegseth suggested that the way forward for Ukraine is for the country to abandon hopes of a return to its pre-2014 borders and prepare for a negotiated settlement with Russia \u2014 one that should be backed up with an international force of troops. Hegseth made the comments during the first trip to NATO and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group by a member of the new Trump administration. Allies have been waiting to hear how much continued military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine\u2019s government.",
