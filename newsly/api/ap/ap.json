      "description": "President Donald Trump says he doubts Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin wants to end his war in Ukraine. Trump is expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon. And his comments come only a day after saying Ukraine and Russia were \u201cvery close to a deal.\u201d Trump said in a social media post Saturday as he flew back to the United States after Pope Francis\u2019 funeral that \u201cthere was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days.\u201d Trump hinted at further sanctions against Russia. Trump said, \u201cIt makes me think that maybe he doesn\u2019t want to stop the war, he\u2019s just tapping me along.\u201d",

      "description": "All Ukrainian troops have been forced from Russia\u2019s Kursk region, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Saturday. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the claim. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials said three people were killed overnight by Russian attacks across Ukraine. The attacks came hours before U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Vatican City on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis. The presidents met at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for about 15 minutes and agreed to continue negotiations later on Saturday, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nykyforov said.",

The farewell ceremony reflects his priorities as pope and wishes as pastor: Presidents and princes will be on hand, but prisoners and migrants will welcome him into the basilica. Francis choreographed the ceremony himself when he revised and simplified the Vatican\u2019s funeral rites and rituals last year. He aimed to emphasize the pope\u2019s role as a mere priest and not \u201ca powerful man of this world.\u201d Francis is breaking with recent tradition and will be buried in the St. Mary Major Basilica.",

A provincial disaster management official told Iranian state television there were injuries in Saturday's blast, without elaborating. He added that first responders were trying to reach the area while others were attempting to evacuate the site. The official said the blast came from containers at Rajaei port in the city. Social media videos showed a huge plume of black smoke. Rajaei port mainly handles container traffic and also has oil tanks and other petrochemical facilities.",

      "description": "An AP-NORC poll finds many Americans don't agree with President Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to quickly enact his agenda, and even Republicans aren't overwhelmingly convinced his attention has been in the right place. Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Trump has been mostly focusing on the wrong priorities as to say he's been focusing on the right ones. The findings suggest Democrats are even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in. While about 7 in 10 Republicans say Trump has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president so far, only about half say he\u2019s emphasized the right things.",

The rally was held Saturday at the Boston Common near the site of a 20-foot-high memorial to racial equity, which shows King embracing his wife, Coretta Scott King. King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, was a leader of the rally. He said in an interview that more work is needed to ensure everyone has access to quality health care, a decent home and a good paying job.",

The cross-border fire followed a gun attack on tourists in Kashmir that India blames Pakistan for. It was the worst assault targeting civilians in the restive region for years. Pakistan denies involvement. The killings set off tit-for-tat measures on visas, treaties and diplomats. India said Saturday that its troops responded appropriately during the overnight firing. In the past, each side has accused the other of starting border skirmishes in the Himalayan region, which both claim in its entirety.",

In cystic fibrosis, for example, medications can vastly improve health for 90% of people with the condition, which is the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S. But the therapies don't work for the 10% of patients with rare mutations. Experts say one big reason for this dynamic is that it's less profitable to develop therapies for smaller numbers of people. With help from charities, however, scientists are working on gene therapies that can help all patients, regardless of mutation.",
