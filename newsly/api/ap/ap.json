      "description": "The Iranian state television says that Iran\u2019s underground enrichment site at Fordo has been attacked again. The report, also carried by other Iranian media, offered no word on damage, nor who launched the assault on Monday. However, Israel has been conducted airstrikes throughout the day in Iran. The United States launched a major attack Sunday on three Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordo, which required the use of sophisticated bunker-buster bombs.",

      "description": "As President Donald Trump floats \u201cregime change\u201d in Tehran, previous U.S. attempts to remake the Middle East by force in recent decades can offer stark warnings about the possibility of a deepening involvement in the Iran-Israeli conflict. Trump posted over the weekend: \u201cIf the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn\u2019t there be a Regime change???\u201d The White House insists Trump, who spent years railing against \u201cforever wars,\" isn't doing an about-face and that Iranian citizens could revolt against its government. But that\u2019s a delicate, perilous path that other U.S. administrations have been down before. And it\u2019s a long way from Trump\u2019s dismissal of \u201cstupid, endless wars.\"",

      "description": "European nations worked Monday to keep alive diplomatic efforts to curb the Israel-Iran war as the two countries traded strikes following the United States\u2019 weekend attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Calls for Tehran to enter talks with Washington appeared to fall on deaf ears. Tehran reached out to ally Russia for support instead. At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels, diplomats expressed concern about the potential for Iranian retaliation to spark a wider war and global economic instability. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged Iran to meet European officials and to open talks with the U.S. But Iran has rejected negotiations with Washington and a European official said no more talks with Iran are currently planned.",

This heat wave is especially threatening because it\u2019s hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia with near-record temperatures and doing so early in the summer when people haven\u2019t gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions. Coming originally from the Pacific, a dome of high pressure is parking over the Eastern United States with hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable rest stop in the Midwest.",

The Coast Guard says swells of more than 8 feet were recorded around the time the 27-foot gold Chris-Craft vessel flipped over Saturday afternoon. Two people were rescued immediately and taken to a hospital in unknown condition. Six bodies were recovered later Saturday. Meteorologists say the intensity of the thunderstorm surprised even forecasters, who'd predicted some rain but nothing like the sudden squall that lashed the southern part of the lake.",

All three liberal justices dissented. The high court\u2019s Monday action came after District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston found the administration had violated his order by sending eight people to South Sudan in May. The migrants had been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. and immigration officials have said they were unable to return them quickly to their home countries. Authorities instead landed the plane at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti.",

Combs has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. Prosecutors expect to rest by Tuesday.

      "description": "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth. The latest WeCount project for the Society of Family Planning finds that 1 in 4 abortions uses medications prescribed by a provider who does not see the patient in person. That is up from 1 in 20 in the months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The number may explain why another recent study found that fewer women crossed state lines for abortion in 2024 than the year before.",
