      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to meet with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, the onetime insurgent who last year led the overthrow of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad. Wednesday's meeting will come a day after Trump announced his plan to ease sanctions on Syria and normalize relations with its new government to give Syria \u201ca chance at peace\u201d under al-Sharaa. The former insurgent had been imprisoned in Iraq for his role in the insurgency following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of the Arab country. He was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by al-Sharaa\u2019s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, that stormed Damascus, ending the 54-year rule of the Assad family.",

The strikes killed at least 48 people in total, the Indonesian Hospital in Jabaliya reported.

On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was \u201cno way\u201d Israel would halt its war in Gaza, dimming hopes for a ceasefire.",

The Democratic governor shared the number Wednesday as he laid out his nearly $322 billion state spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year. He says the deficit is partly due to broad economic uncertainty, including ever-changing federal tariff policies and a volatile stock market. California relies heavily on revenue from a tax on capital gains. Newsom hasn\u2019t fully detailed how he\u2019ll cover the deficit. But he has proposed freezing enrollment in state-funded health care for more immigrants starting in 2026. The program is costing more than the state expected.",

The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018. Experts say several things could be driving the decline. They include increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, expanded addiction treatment and shifts in how people use drugs.",

      "description": "Scientists in Australia have identified the oldest known fossil footprints of a reptile-like animal on a slab of sandstone recovered near Melbourne. The fossil tracks date to around 350 million years ago. The discovery suggests that after the first animals emerged from the ocean around 400 million years ago, they evolved the ability to live exclusively on land much faster than previously thought. The ancient reptile had long toes and hooked claws and may have resembled a modern monitor lizard. The research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
