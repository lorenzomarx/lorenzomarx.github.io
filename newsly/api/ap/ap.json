      "description": "The Justice Department has asked a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s case amid a firestorm over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of records related to the wealthy financier. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche filed a motion urging the court to release the transcripts a day after President Donald Trump directed the Justice Department to do so. The Trump administration has been embroiled in controversy since the Justice Department last week announced that it would not be releasing any more evidence in its possession from Epstein\u2019s investigation.",

      "description": "Under intense pressure from President Donald Trump\u2019s own supporters, his administration now says it will push a court to unseal secret documents related to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s case. It's an effort to put to rest for good a political crisis largely of the administration's own making. But even if those records eventually become public, it\u2019s far from certain they will appease critics enraged over the administration\u2019s unfulfilled promises of full transparency about the evidence against the wealthy financier. Meanwhile, the administration remains dogged by questions about its refusal to release other records in its possession.",

The GENIUS Act sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is tied to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility. It passed both the House and Senate with wide bipartisan margins. The measure is meant to bolster consumer confidence in the rapidly growing crypto sector. Its passage comes as Trump makes it a mission to establish the U.S. as the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",

      "description": "Venezuela has released 10 jailed Americans in exchange for getting home scores of migrants deported by the United States to El Salvador months ago under the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The resolution represents a diplomatic achievement for Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and helps President Donald Trump in his goal of bringing home Americans jailed abroad. El Salvador will send back some 300 Venezuelan migrants whom the Trump administration agreed to pay $6 million to house in a notorious Salvadoran prison. The arrangement drew immediate blowback when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law to quickly remove men his administration had accused of belonging to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang.",

      "description": "Top church leaders have visited Gaza after its only Catholic church was struck by an Israeli shell the day before. The attack Thursday killed three people and wounded ten, including a priest who had developed a close friendship with the late Pope Francis. The strike drew condemnation from the pope and U.S. President Donald Trump, and prompted a statement of regret from Israel, which said it was a mistake. Since ending a ceasefire in March, Israel has regularly launched far deadlier strikes across Gaza against what it says are Hamas militants, frequently killing women and children. Strikes killed 18 people overnight, health officials said Friday.",

Skeptics abound \u2014 Colbert has been a fierce critic of President Donald Trump \u2014 but there's no denying the economics of television are not looking good. TV is rapidly losing eyeballs to streaming services and making hard decisions about programming. Late-night was once a valuable audience for advertisers because the genre had a lot of hard-to-reach young men. Now many of them are streaming, either to watch something else or see highlights of late-night comics that are hard for networks to monetize.",
