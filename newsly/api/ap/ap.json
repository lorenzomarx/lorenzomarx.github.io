      "description": "A federal appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to continue collecting tariffs under an emergency powers law for now, as his administration appeals an order striking down the bulk of his signature set of economic policies. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted an emergency motion Thursday from the Trump administration arguing that a halt is \u201ccritical for the country\u2019s national security.\u201d The appeals court temporarily halted the order from a federal trade court issued a day before. Trump is facing several lawsuits arguing Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs exceeded his authority and left the country\u2019s trade policy dependent on his whims.",

      "description": "A federal judge has extended an order blocking the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to bar Harvard University from enrolling foreign students. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs granted Harvard\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking the government\u2019s action until the case is decided. It had already been paused since last week, when Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order. Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security after Secretary Kristi Noem revoked its ability to host foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced a new effort to revoke Harvard\u2019s certification to enroll foreign students.",

At least 10 people were trapped in the rubble when the mine in Cirebon district collapsed, West Java Governor Dedi Mulyadi estimated in a video statement, and rescuers have retrieved at least two bodies. The exact number of casualties was still unclear as local television reported rescuers were able to pull at least a dozen injured people from the debris and recover bodies during a grueling search effort.",

President Donald Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy had expressed optimism this week about brokering an agreement that could halt the Israel-Hamas war, allow more aid into Gaza, and return more of the 58 hostages still held by Hamas, around a third of whom are alive. Experts say a nearly three-month Israeli blockade of Gaza has pushed the population of roughly 2 million Palestinians to the brink of famine.",
