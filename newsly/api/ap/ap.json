      "description": "President Donald Trump is set to unveil his proposed Board of Peace at the World Economic Forum. It's an idea that was initially envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the Gaza ceasefire. But it has morphed into something far more ambitious. The rollout of the board has been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s pressure campaign over acquiring Greenland. Some European leaders have said they'll take a pass on the new panel that Trump has suggested could eventually make the United Nations obsolete. Trump wants to spotlight the proposed board on Thursday.",

      "description": "Joe Biden promised Europe that \"America is back\" early in his presidency, aiming to mend ties after Donald Trump's tenure. However, nearly five years later, Trump's influence over Europe has grown. Recently, Trump demanded Denmark cede Greenland to the U.S., causing turmoil within NATO. European leaders are responding by exploring alliances that exclude the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney highlighted a global shift, calling the rules-based order an \"illusion.\" European leaders criticized Trump's approach, while some Republicans supported him. Democrats urged stronger responses, stressing the need for a lasting shift in U.S. politics to rebuild trust.",

Bondi announced the arrest of Nekima Levy Armstrong in a post on X on Thursday. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement serves as a pastor. The group interrupted services by chanting \u201cICE out\u201d and \u201cJustice for Renee Good,\u201d referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month. Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and prominent local activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign.",

Thursday's hearing is expected to focus fresh attention on Smith's two criminal investigations that shadowed Donald Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. Smith testified behind closed doors last month but returns to the House Judiciary Committee for a public hearing. The hearing is likely to divide along partisan lines between Republican lawmakers looking to undermine Smith and Democrats hoping to elicit new and damaging testimony about Trump\u2019s conduct in the Washington, D.C., and Florida cases. The hearing unfolds against the backdrop of an ongoing Trump administration retribution campaign targeting the investigators who scrutinized the Republican president.",

      "description": "A new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track space junk by tuning into their sonic booms. Scientists reported Thursday that they collected seismic readings from the sonic booms generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered in 2024. The data allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles farther south than radar had predicted from orbit. The study in the journal Science focused on one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including those from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights.",

The S&P 500 rose 0.4% Thursday, continuing its rally after President Donald Trump called off tariffs on European countries that he said opposed his desire to have Greenland. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 260 points, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%. Details are still sparse about the framework of a deal on Greenland that Trump said he reached with the head of NATO. Financial markets nevertheless showed signs of steadiness, though nerves were still apparent. Gold's price eased, while the U.S. dollar's value was mixed against other currencies.",
