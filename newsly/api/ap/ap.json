      "description": "President Donald Trump plans to host Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House. The visit Tuesday highlights efforts to strengthen security and economic ties between the two countries as tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific. Their talks are expected to focus on mutual defense as China has become increasingly assertive in the South China Sea, where Manila and Beijing have clashed over hotly contested territory. The leaders also are negotiating a potential tariffs deal. Marcos met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday. Both sides emphasized their commitment to regional peace and economic collaboration.",

      "description": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is rebuffing pressure to act on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The speaker is sending members of the House home early for a month-long break from Washington amid calls for a vote on the Epstein matter. Johnson said Tuesday morning that he wants to give the White House \u201cspace\u201d to release the Epstein information on its own. The speaker\u2019s stance seemed unlikely to satisfy many Republicans who are threatening to support a bipartisan bill to pry information from the Justice Department. Even before Johnson spoke, a Republican-controlled committee was advancing a resolution to subpoena Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, for a deposition.",

      "description": "The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland. Russia now batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024. Analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record. Some experts say that could soon reach 1,000 a day. This comes amid a U.S. ultimatum for Russia to reach a ceasefire by Sept. 2 or face tough sanctions -\u2013 a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible.",

The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency promoting anti-Israel speech. The UNESCO chief said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She denied accusations of anti-Israel bias,",

In a rare online interview, Hunter Biden unleashes a string of expletives when discussing Clooney with Andrew Gallagher of Channel 5.

But Clooney changed his stance after Biden's disastrous debate performance against Republican Donald Trump and added his voice to calls for Biden to leave the race in an opinion piece published by The New York Times.

A SkyWest pilot performed a sharp turn, startling passengers, to avoid colliding with the B-52 bomber that he said was in his flight path as he prepared to land Friday at Minot International Airport. The bomber was conducting a pre-approved flyover for the North Dakota State Fair. The Air Force says the Minot tower directed the bomber crew but didn't inform them of the inbound SkyWest flight.
