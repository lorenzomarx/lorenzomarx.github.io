      "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that a \u201clast minute crisis\u201d with Hamas was holding up Israeli approval of a long-awaited agreement to pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip and release dozens of hostages. Israeli airstrikes meanwhile killed dozens of people across the war-ravaged territory. Netanyahu\u2019s office said his Cabinet won\u2019t meet to approve the agreement until Hamas backs down, accusing it of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced the deal on Wednesday, which is aimed at releasing scores of hostages held in Gaza and winding down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.",

      "description": "The ceasefire announced between Israel and Hamas gives hope to families of hostages and war-weary Palestinians \u2014 but their nightmare is far from over. Families of the hostages do not know whether their loved ones are alive or dead, and many will have to wait for a subsequent phase of the agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In war-ravaged Gaza, many displaced Palestinians do not know if their homes are still standing. Thousands are still buried under rubble and dozens are missing after encounters with Israeli forces. Vast areas appear uninhabitable, and it could take decades to rebuild. In the tense leadup to the announcement of the deal, relatives of the hostages were afraid to get their hopes up and agonizing over the unknown.",

At least eight states have enacted such bans in recent years and proposals are being considered in several more states this year. The push for restrictions on cellphones at schools is being fueled by concerns about the impact screen time is having on children's mental health and the distraction they're posing in the classroom. But the bans are facing pushback from some parents and students who say the devices are needed to communicate in case of an emergency.",

Speaking Wednesday from the Oval Office as he prepares to hand over power to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden sounded alarm over the accumulation of power and wealth among a small few. Biden also called for a constitutional amendment to end immunity for sitting presidents, after the Supreme Court granted Trump sweeping protections last year from criminal liability over his role in trying to undermine his 2020 defeat to Biden.",
