      "description": "Cryptocurrency prices jumped after President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise announcement he wants the U.S. government to purchase and hold a variety of digital assets in a strategic reserve fund, an announcement that highlights Trump\u2019s growing attempts to use volatile cryptocurrency prices as a barometer of his public support. Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \u201cCrypto Strategic Reserve\u201d that will include lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",

      "description": "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said that her administration is waiting to see if U.S. President Donald Trump makes good on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican imports. Her Cabinet secretaries for security and trade among others have been in constant communication with their U.S. counterparts and she said Monday there was still the possibility she and Trump would speak. Trump had threatened to impose tariffs in February before suspending them at the last minute when Mexico sent 10,000 National Guard troops to their shared border to crack down on drug trafficking and illegal immigration.",

      "description": "Chinese manufacturers reported stronger orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs. Surveys of factory managers showed China's official purchasing managers index rose to 50.2%, though that was just above the 50 level that marks the break between contraction and expansion. The new orders index rose to 51.1. Another survey released Monday showed a similar improvement. The stronger-than-expected data came as Chinese leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual session of the National People's Congress. Lawmakers are expected as usual to endorse policies and priorities set by the ruling Communist Party, which could include some fresh help for the economy as it slows to growth economists forecast will fall below 5%.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 89 points, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.1%. Treasury yields sank after a report on U.S. manufacturing showed weaker growth than expected. It followed other weaker-than-expected economic reports that have yanked stocks off their all-time high. Worries about tariffs have also hurt the market, and more tariffs are set to take effect Tuesday.

Two justices, though, said publicly they would have heard the case brought by Indiana University students. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas would have heard the students' claims that a bias-response team stifles speech on campus by allowing anonymous reports about things that appear prejudiced or demeaning. The university says the program is aimed at education and support, and that the two-person team doesn\u2019t dole out punishment.",

      "description": "Judging by his past speeches to Congress, President Donald Trump once felt the need to ask lawmakers to pass his agenda. Not so much anymore. As he prepares to address Congress on Tuesday night, Trump has asserted his authority to reshape the federal government without needing to consult the legislative branch. That\u2019s a break from his previous remarks to Congress in which the president specifically sought lawmakers\u2019 backing on many of the actions he\u2019s now taking unilaterally. On his own, Trump has signed orders to levy punishing taxes on imports, deport immigrants in the country illegally, fire hundreds of thousands of federal workers and freeze congressionally approved spending.",

The plan is different from the one the two sides agreed to in January. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to it as the \u201cWitkoff proposal.\u201d He says it came from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff. But the White House has yet to confirm that. Netanyahu\u2019s remarks came a day after the first phase of the negotiated ceasefire ended, with no clarity on what would come next since the agreement\u2019s second phase has not yet been hammered out. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",
