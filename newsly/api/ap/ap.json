      "description": "Iran held annual military drills with Russia as a second American aircraft carrier drew closer to the Middle East. Both the United States and Iran are signaling they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program fizzle out. President Donald Trump said Thursday he believes 10 to 15 days is enough time for Iran to reach a deal. But talks on its nuclear program have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups. Indirect talks held in recent weeks made little visible progress, and one or both sides could be buying time for final war preparations.",

      "description": "Saudi Arabia could have some form of uranium enrichment within the kingdom under a proposed nuclear deal with the United States. That's according to congressional documents and an arms control group. Both U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden tried to reach a nuclear deal with the kingdom to share American technology. Nonproliferation experts warn any spinning centrifuges within Saudi Arabia could open the door to a possible weapons program for the kingdom. The kingdom's assertive crown prince has suggested he could pursue a nuclear weapon if Tehran obtains an atomic bomb.",

      "description": "Iranians are still reeling with shock, grief and fear after Iran's rulers unleashed the deadliest crackdown ever seen in the Islamic Republic last month. But a vein of defiance persists. In some districts of the capital and other cities, residents shout anti-government slogans from their roofs and balconies at night. And this week, memorials marking the passage of 40 days since protesters' deaths are being held, turning a traditional rite of mourning into political protests. In videos of some 40-day memorials, hundreds gather and often chant against the government.",

While Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied Justice Department building Thursday amounts to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department\u2019s tradition of independence from White House control. The banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says, \u201cMake America Safe Again,\u201d a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.",

Principal Alonna McMullen says it was heartbreaking telling 5 and 6 year old students in Linda Davis' special needs classes of her death. The crash happened Monday less than a half mile from the school where Davis taught in Savannah's southern suburbs. Authorities say the driver was a Guatemalan man who crashed after running a stoplight to evade immigration officers seeking to detain him on a judge's deportation order. McMullen said Davis had an upbeat personality and a determination to ensure all of her students thrived.",
