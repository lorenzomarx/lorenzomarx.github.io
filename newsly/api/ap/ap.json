      "description": "Gaza health officials and multiple witnesses say at least 25 people were killed and scores were wounded as they were on their way to receive food in the strip. The witnesses said Israeli forces fired on crowds on Sunday around a kilometer away from an aid site run by an Israeli-backed foundation. The military released a brief statement saying it was unaware of any injuries caused by Israeli fire within the distribution site. The foundation said it delivered aid at its sites \u201cwithout incident\u201d early on Sunday. An Associated Press reporter saw dozens of people being treated at a nearby field hospital.",

      "description": "By making harsh, uncompromising demands in peace talks with Ukraine while continuing to pummel it with waves of missiles and drones, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a clear message: He will only accept a settlement on his terms and will keep fighting until they\u2019re met. At the same time, he has sought to avoid angering U.S. President Donald Trump by praising his diplomacy and declaring Moscow\u2019s openness to peace talks \u2014 even as he set maximalist conditions that are rejected by Kyiv and the West. Trump, who once promised to end the 3-year-old war in 24 hours, has upended the U.S. policy of isolating Russia by holding calls with Putin and denigrating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won\u2019t bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package. The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised. The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add $5.1 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if they are allowed to continue. That's according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",

The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. The three officials are appearing at an energy conference convened by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and at events with industry representatives and Alaska Native leaders who support drilling.",

A lot of the protest in the U.S. are expected to be against President Donald Trump's efforts to impose restrictions across several fronts on transgender people.

As they fulfill a religious obligation, they immerse themselves in what can be a profound spiritual experience of a lifetime and a chance to seek God\u2019s forgiveness and the erasure of past sins. For the pilgrims, the Hajj is seen as an opportunity to grow closer to God and to walk in the footsteps of prophets. The Hajj unites Muslims of diverse races, ethnicities, languages and economic classes in performing rituals together.",

The contest Sunday pits Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, a liberal pro-European Union figure, against Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party. The outcome will determine whether Poland continues along a nationalist path or pivots more decisively toward liberal democratic norms. With President Andrzej Duda completing his second and final term, the new president will have significant influence over the legislative agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist government, given the presidential power to veto laws.",

In one of the incidents, seven people were killed and dozens were injured. The first bridge, in the Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine, collapsed on top of a passenger train on Saturday, causing the casualties. Hours later, officials said a second train derailed when the bridge beneath it collapsed in the nearby Kursk region, which also borders Ukraine. Russian investigators say they're treating the bridge collapses as potential acts of terrorism.",
