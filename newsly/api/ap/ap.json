      "description": "The former Ukrainian army general widely seen as the top political rival to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken publicly for the first time about a deep rift between the two men. The comments made by Valerii Zaluzhnyi during an interview with the AP signal his possible desire to run for the presidency after the war is over. Zelenskyy ousted Zaluzhnyi as head of the army in 2024 and later appointed him as the country\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Zaluzhnyi told AP that their strained relationship reached a boiling point in 2022, when domestic intelligence agents raided his office, a previously unreported incident he alleges was an act of intimidation. Zelenskyy's office and the country's security service declined to comment. The AP could not confirm Zaluzhnyi's account of the raid.",

      "description": "Crews have pushed through mountainous wilderness in California near Lake Tahoe during a snowstorm to rescue six backcountry skiers who survived an avalanche but were trapped by its snow and ice. Nine others from their tour group remain missing. The Nevada County Sheriff's Office says two of the six were taken to a hospital for treatment. The sheriff\u2019s office says there were 15 skiers on the trip \u2014 not 16 as initially believed. Extreme weather conditions in the Northern California mountains slowed the rescue effort. It took crews several hours to reach the skiers and take them to safety, where they were evaluated by the Truckee Fire Department.",

The billionaire retail magnate on Wednesday is expected to face questions about new revelations contained in Epstein-related documents released by the Justice Department. The 88-year-old Wexner is the retired founder of L Brands. He says he intends to cooperate with House Oversight Committee members' inquiry. As one of Epstein\u2019s most prominent former friends, Wexner has already spent years answering for their association. He denies any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein\u2019s crimes. Wexner's name appears more than 1,000 times.",
