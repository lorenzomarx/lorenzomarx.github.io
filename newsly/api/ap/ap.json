      "description": "President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are starting their day by taking part in a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven economies to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump welcomed Macron to the White House on Monday at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations. The Republican meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Trump has transformed American foreign policy and effectively tuned out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war. The \u201cAmerica First\u201d president has cast a shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and ex-government officials had regarded as America\u2019s calming presence of global stability.",

      "description": "On the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on dueling resolutions. One is Ukraine\u2019s European-backed proposal demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the country. The other is a U.S. resolution for a swift end to the war that never mentions Moscow\u2019s aggression. The Monday votes are a reflection of the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. General Assembly resolutions aren't legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",

Gov. Janet Mills\u2019 vow that she would see Trump in court over his threat to withhold money from the state if it didn\u2019t comply with his executive order delighted Democrats who want more strident pushback. But the dust-up that played out in the open Friday as Trump hosted governors at the White House ticked off a president known to retaliate against people he considers enemies. Democratic governors are trying to strike a balance between their states\u2019 needs and their feelings about Trump.",

In just a month as the agency\u2019s acting No. 2 official, Bove has plowed through norms and niceties, whether scolding FBI leadership for \u201cinsubordination\u201d in refusing his request to hand over the names of agents who investigated the January 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol or forcing out attorneys who worked those cases. The moves have spurred intense criticism from legal scholars and former prosecutors. But Bove has brushed aside such concerns in a way that is not at all surprising to many who knew him when he was litigating drug and terrorism cases as a federal prosecutor in New York City.",

      "description": "Germany faces its second change of leader in less than four years after the head of the center-right opposition won Sunday\u2019s election. The vote saw a surge for a far-right party and a stinging defeat for outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. After the collapse of Scholz\u2019s three-party government in November, it\u2019s now up to Friedrich Merz to restore stability to Germany. His most realistic option is to form a coalition with Scholz's Social Democrats. The two parties were Germany's post-World War II heavyweights. But their combined showing Sunday was their weakest since the postwar republic was founded. Meanwhile, while the far-right Alternative for Germany made the biggest gains, the Left Party made the most unexpected.",
