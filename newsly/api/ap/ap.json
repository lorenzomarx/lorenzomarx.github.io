Combs is accused of forcing women including Cassie into drugged-up sex parties he described as \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d Prosecutors say he used his status as a powerful executive to coerce women into abusive sexual encounters. Lawyers for three-time Grammy winner told the jury that while Combs could be violent, he never veered into sex trafficking or racketeering. Cassie has been at the center of Combs\u2019 stunning downfall. She sued him in 2023 alleging years of abuse. A surveillance video made public last year showed Combs beating her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",

Federal prosecutors charged Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan in April with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. A grand jury affirmed the charges in an indictment after convening Tuesday to determine whether there was enough probable cause to continue the case. FBI agents arrested Dugan at the Milwaukee County courthouse a week after authorities said she directed Eduardo Flores-Ruiz out a back door in her courtroom after learning immigration agents were in the courthouse searching for him. According to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Dugan's attorneys said she maintains her innocence.",

The brothers have spent more than 30 years in prison for killing their parents at their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Their attorneys are expected to argue over the course of a two-day hearing starting Tuesday that the brothers have been rehabilitated in prison, and they have the support of their extended family. Prosecutors have said they oppose resentencing because the brothers have not admitted to lies told during their trial about why they killed their parents.",

The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% Tuesday and erased its loss for the year so far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.6% as AI and other tech stocks led the way. The report on inflation could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates later this year to help the economy, but analysts and economists cautioned that inflation could still run higher in coming months because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
