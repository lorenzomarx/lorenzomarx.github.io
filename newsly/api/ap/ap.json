      "description": "A federal court has blocked the Trump administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president\u2019s immigration crackdown. In a legal filing Sunday, lawyers for the men asked the court for a temporary restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that \u201cthe mere uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest injunction.\u201d An attorney for the men says that the court granted the temporary order during a brief hearing a short time later. A message seeking comment was left for ICE.",

      "description": "Top Trump administration officials are openly questioning the judiciary\u2019s authority to serve as a check on executive power as the new president\u2019s sweeping agenda faces growing pushback from the courts. Over the last 24 hours, officials ranging from billionaire Elon Musk to Vice President JD Vance, have criticized a federal judge\u2019s decision early Saturday that blocks Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. They have also attacked the legitimacy of judicial oversight, a fundamental pillar of a Democratic system based on a separation of powers.",

Russell Vought is the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought directed the CFPB in a Saturday night email to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama created it following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.",

President Daniel Noboa and Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez were the clear front-runners in Sunday's election among the pool of 16 candidates. All have promised to reduce the widespread crime that pushed people's lives into an unnerving new normal four years ago. The spike in violence is tied to the trafficking of cocaine from neighboring Colombia and Peru. After polls closed, the National Electoral Council reported that more than 83% of eligible voters cast ballots.",

The deal is moving ahead but faces a major test over whether the sides can negotiate its planned extension. Israel agreed as part of the truce to remove its forces from the 4-mile Netzarim corridor, a strip of land that bisects northern Gaza from the south. While the development Sunday signals the agreement is moving ahead, the sides appear to have made little progress on negotiating the deal\u2019s second phase, which is meant to extend the truce and lead to the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.",

While vowing to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d for fossil fuels, Trump has ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the landmark international Paris climate accord.
