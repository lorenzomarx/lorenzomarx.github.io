      "description": "The youngest person to serve as White House press secretary has made her debut in the briefing room, promising to hold briefings often and saying President Donald Trump also will be available to reporters for questions. Karoline Leavitt said at the podium Tuesday podcasters and social media influencers could apply to participate in future briefings and reporters will have \u201caccess to the most transparent and accessible president in American history.\" Leavitt called on Mike Allen of Axios for the first question. It\u2019s unclear how often the 27-year-old Leavitt plans to hold briefings. Previously, the youngest press secretary was Ronald Ziegler, who was 29 when he took the position in 1969 in Richard Nixon\u2019s administration.",

      "description": "Democrats are planning to fight President Donald Trump's efforts to pause federal grants and loans. The court battle will likely begin with a lawsuit from the New York attorney general. The funding freeze is scheduled to take effect Tuesday as Trump\u2019s administration begins an across-the-board ideological review. Administration officials said the pause is necessary to ensure that spending complies with the president's executive orders. The Republican administration's decision could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research, education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted. It\u2019s unclear how sweeping the pause will be.",

The Abu Jarad family returned to Beit Lahiya Monday to find that the orange, olive and palm trees that once stood in front of their house were bulldozed away. The roses and jasmine flowers were also gone. The house itself was a hollowed-out shell. But it stood. At the sight of it, Ne\u2019man Abu Jarad; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters dropped the bags they had been lugging since dawn, fell to their knees and prayed. After 477 days of hell \u2014 fleeing the length of the Gaza Strip, hiding from bombardment, scrounging for food and water \u2013 they were finally home.",

Trump's second administration has opened with a notable embrace of some of the world's wealthiest people alongside a flurry of executive actions on immigration and other topics. There's a delicate balance for the populist president. And some progressive activists say it already has exposed the billionaire Republican president's true loyalties. Arizona home construction contractor Enrique Lopez says he's struck by Trump's lack of emphasis on housing costs or consumer interests. Trump insists his overall agenda will help working- and middle-class Americans.",

Staff encountered problems with Medicaid and Head Start payment websites around the country. The administration of President Donald Trump said those programs were not affected by the funding freeze and called the Medicaid problem an outage. The freeze was halted by a federal judge but the chaos showed how dependent programs serving low-income kids are on the federal government.",
