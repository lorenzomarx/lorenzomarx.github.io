      "description": "President Donald Trump says he\u2019s deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. It\u2019s not the first time Trump has activated the National Guard to quell protests. In 2020, he asked governors of several states to send troops to Washington, D.C. to respond to demonstrations that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Here are some things to know about when and how the president can deploy troops on U.S. soil.",

      "description": "Russian officials say that Moscow is still awaiting confirmation from Kyiv on a planned exchange of 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in action and is accusing Ukraine of delaying the process. Lt. Gen. Alexander Zorin, a Russian negotiator, said on Sunday that Russia delivered 1,212 bodies of Ukrainian troops to a border site and is receiving \u201csignals\u201d the transfer may be postponed until next week. The swap was agreed during direct talks in Istanbul, though both sides have since accused each other of undermining the plan.

      "description": "Six decades after the federal government ordered Concordia Parish to desegregate its schools, the district remains racially divided. Black students make up more than 92% of Ferriday High School, while 15 minutes away, Vidalia High is 62% white. Yet state and local officials say it\u2019s time to free Concordia Parish and other districts from court-ordered desegregation orders dating back decades. In a stunning shift that reverses decades of policy, they have allies in the federal government. The Trump administration has vowed to lift more desegregation plans from the 1960s. Civil rights activists say it would leave families with little recourse when they face discrimination.",

Sharafoddin hoped his wife's niece could follow them to their new home in South Carolina. But President Donald Trump's travel ban on people from Afghanistan and 11 other countries appears to have shut that door. Sharafoddin says his niece wants to be a doctor, and it is especially hard because she can't study in her home country under the Taliban, who returned to power in 2021 .",

      "description": "Italians vote over two days on referendums that would make it easier for children born in Italy to foreigners to obtain citizenship, and on providing more job protections. But apparent low public awareness risks rendering the vote invalid if turnout is not high enough. Campaigners for the change in the citizenship law say it will help second-generation Italians born in the country to non-EU parents better integrate in a culture they already see as theirs. The referendum risks failure if 50% plus one of eligible voters don\u2019t turn out. The measures were proposed by Italy\u2019s main union and left-wing opposition parties.",
