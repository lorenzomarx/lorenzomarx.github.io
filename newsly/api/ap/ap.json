      "description": "The crash of a Delta Airlines plane in Toronto is the fourth major aviation disaster in North America in the last month. The deadliest crash was a midair collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight that killed 67 near Washington. Then just days later a medical transport jet with a child patient, her mother and four others aboard crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, exploding in a fireball that engulfed several homes. Then earlier this month a small commuter plane on its way to Nome, Alaska, crashed, killing the pilot and nine passengers.",

      "description": "Recent aviation disasters and close calls definitely have people worried about the safety of flying. The midair collision that killed 67 near Washington and the fiery plane crash in Philadelphia and now a missing plane in Alaska are only the most high-profile disasters. There was also a plane that clipped a parked plane while taxiing at the Seattle airport earlier this week and a United Airlines plane that caught fire during takeoff at the Houston airport. But even with all these incidents the statistics show that flying remains the safest form of transportation compared with driving or even riding on a train.",

      "description": "The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a fatal midair collision near Washington. Probationary workers were targeted in late-night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired. That's according to David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union. One air traffic controller told The Associated Press the fired workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says fewer than 400 FAA employees were fired and \u201cZero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel were let go.\u201d",

Shortly before the meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump, but Macron\u2019s office would not disclose details about the 20-minute discussion. European leaders have been stunned by a weeklong diplomatic blitz on Ukraine from the Trump administration that seemed to embrace the Kremlin while it cold-shouldered many of its age-old European allies. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, underlined Monday that Europe has no place at the negotiating table.",

It would be the most significant meeting between the sides since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor nearly three years ago. The talks are scheduled for Tuesday in Saudi Arabia. They mark another consequential step by the Trump administration to reverse U.S. policy on isolating Russia, and are meant to pave the way for a meeting between U.S. and Russian presidents. The moves have sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won\u2019t be favorable to them. France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K.",
