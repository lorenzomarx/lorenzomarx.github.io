      "description": "Ukrainians are grappling with the consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pause military aid vital for their fight against Russia\u2019s invasion. That step came days after a disastrous Oval Office row that has deepened a rift between Kyiv and the White House. U.S. President Donald Trump directed the U.S. to pause all assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in peace talks with Russia. Ukraine, which depends heavily on foreign help to hold back the Russian invasion that began on Feb. 24 2022, Kyiv has feared the possibility of aid being stopped to Ukraine ever since Trump took office.",

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made the decision, which was confirmed Monday by a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations. The suspension of some cybersecurity preparations comes as many national security experts warn of a greater threat posed by Russia, China and other adversaries. Hegseth\u2019s decision doesn't affect cyberoperations conducted by other agencies, including the CIA. U.S. Cyber Command oversees and coordinates defensive and offensive cybersecurity work for the Pentagon and is known as America's first line of defense in cyberspace.",

      "description": "Ukraine\u2019s president has few options after last week\u2019s astonishing Oval Office row with U.S. President Donald Trump, who berated the wartime leader. Now Ukraine\u2019s future could depend on whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy can repair his relationship with the White House. The heated conversation that played out live on television looms over all American support for Ukraine and could shape the country\u2019s war against the Russian invasion. The scene will almost certainly stick with Zelenskyy for the rest of his presidency, if not his life. American officials have said that they want an apology from Zelenskyy. He has maintained his cool in public appearances since the episode and leaned into European support.",

The extraordinarily frank criticism from Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou came in a parliamentary debate on Ukraine on Monday. His words diverged from the more nuanced tone that French President Emmanuel Macron has adopted in the wake of the clash at the White House on Friday and dropped the diplomatic niceties that customarily mark French-U.S. relations. Bayrou called it \u201ca staggering scene\u201d that was \u201cmarked by brutality\u201d and \u201ca desire to humiliate\u201d Zelenskyy.",

      "description": "As his White House meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart devolved into a stunning blowup, President Donald Trump leaned on a familiar refrain to explain his unique kinship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He said that Putin had \u201csuffered\u201d through the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The reference underscored the extent to which Trump\u2019s lingering fury over an inquiry he has misleadingly branded a \u201choax\u201d remains top of mind even now. It also showed that Trump\u2019s view of a war that Russia launched in Ukraine three years ago is colored not only by his relationship with Putin but also by his experience with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

      "description": "China's leaders are overseeing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world. While cheaper prices can be a blessing, deflation is a symptom of relatively weak demand and stalling economic growth. Falling housing prices have left many families reluctant to spend, while factories keep churning out goods. This has led to the country's longest deflationary streak since the 1960s. Deflation is an abstract economic concept but it reflects very concretely in family balance sheets. Economists say it may signal bigger trouble ahead, while rising tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States could dent demand, further aggravating the problem.",

Starting just past midnight Tuesday, imports from Canada and Mexico are now taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. In addition, the 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%. China retaliated Tuesday with additional tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports, among other measures. Canada also has announced tariffs on American goods.
