      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to the United Arab Emirates late Sunday as momentum grows for potential peace talks ending Moscow\u2019s war on the country. U.S. President Donald Trump last week suggested he would be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, long has been floated as a possible site for peace talks as well given the large population of Russian and Ukrainian expatriates who have flooded the country since the war began, and due to the Emirates\u2019 work on prisoner exchanges in the past.",

      "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to ending Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has left European allies and Ukrainian officials worried they're being largely sidelined by the new U.S. administration as Washington and Moscow plan direct negotiations. With the three-year war grinding on, Trump is sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and special envoy Steve Witkoff to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russian counterparts. That's according to a U.S. official who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the upcoming diplomatic efforts and spoke on condition of anonymity. It's unclear whether Ukraine or European officials will be represented in upcoming discussions. Who ultimately ends up at the table could change.",

      "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests. The proposal, which was a key part of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return. That's according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks. Zelenskyy\u2019s decision not to sign a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",

Netanyahu called it \u201cthe only viable plan to enable a different future\u201d for the region. He discussed the plan on Sunday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The American diplomat was kicking off a visit to the Middle East. Rubio endorsed Israel\u2019s war aims in Gaza and said that Hamas \u201cmust be eradicated.\u201d That created further doubt around the shaky ceasefire as talks on its second phase are yet to begin. Rubio next visits regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",

Water has submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides have blocked roads in Virginia. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service has warned residents to stay off the roads. Forecasters also have predicted weekend snowstorms in the Northeast and the threat of tornadoes for the Mississippi Valley. Heavy snow is expected to blanket much of New England. Meteorologists are also warning the U.S. could get its coldest polar vortex stretching event this season in the northern Rockies and northern Plains.",

The comments by Ukraine's economy minister on Sunday came at a time of intense speculation over planned U.S.-Russia talks in the country to end Moscow's war on its neighbor. And as a top U.S. envoy revealed that he and a fellow negotiator appointed by President Donald Trump were heading there. Trump earlier this week jettisoned three years of U.S. policy and announced he would likely meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a deal to end almost three years of fighting.",

It's an about-face that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE\u2019s blind cost cutting will put communities at risk. Three U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press said up to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were abruptly laid off late Thursday. One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas. Those employees have one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, reassembling warheads. By late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28.",

That's according to documents obtained Sunday that would mark the first appeal to the justices since President Donald Trump took office. The emergency appeal is the start of what probably will be a steady stream seeking to undo lower court rulings that have slowed his second term agenda. The Justice Department\u2019s filing obtained by The Associated Press asks the conservative-majority court to lift a judge\u2019s order temporarily reinstating Hampton Dellinger as the leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
