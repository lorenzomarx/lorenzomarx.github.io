      "description": "International condemnation is growing over Israel\u2019s decision for a military takeover of Gaza City. And little appears to be changing immediately on the ground in the Palestinian territory shattered by 22 months of war. Health officials say 11 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead Saturday while 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours. Ceasefire efforts are reviving with Israel's announcement. Families of hostages rallied again to pressure the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid fears that the offensive will put the 50 remaining hostages at risk. Just 20 of them are thought to be alive.",

The streets were bustling with revelers, but there was no visible increase in law enforcement. Trump had announced a security lockdown starting at midnight, following a weekend assault on a government official. He has threatened to take federal control of the city, citing safety concerns. Mayor Muriel Bowser has not publicly responded. Trump's plans could include deploying the National Guard, but further actions may face legal challenges. The situation remains fluid as the city awaits further developments.",

The NYPD's Bangladeshi American Police Association says Officer Didarul Islam was among more than 1,000 Bangladeshi officers within the department\u2019s roughly 33,000 sworn members. There are also another 1,500 people of Bangladeshi heritage in the department\u2019s civilian ranks. The growth of Bangladeshi officers came partly in response to anti-Muslim sentiment after 9/11. Many have followed a similar path of taking civilian roles such as traffic enforcement and then enrolling in the police academy once they earn their citizenship.",

Survivors in the Japanese city will commemorate the anniversary Saturday by passing on their stories and telling younger people it remains relevant to their future. Survivors increasingly worry the world is moving in the opposite direction. The atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed some 70,000 people three days after the bombing of Hiroshima that killed 140,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II.",

This was SpaceX\u2019s third Pacific splashdown with people on board, but the first for a NASA crew in 50 years.",
