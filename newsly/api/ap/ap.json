      "description": "The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed the Justice Department for files in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation and is seeking depositions with the Clintons and former law enforcement officials. It's part of a congressional probe lawmakers believe may show links to President Donald Trump and former top officials. The Republican-controlled committee issued subpoenas for depositions with former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and eight former top law enforcement officials. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein\u2019s crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago. But lawmakers from both major political parties and many members of the Republican president\u2019s base have refused to let it go.",

      "description": "Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s ex-girlfriend wants to keep grand jury records secret in the sex trafficking case that sent her to prison. Her lawyers said so in a court filing Tuesday. They wrote that Maxwell hasn\u2019t seen the material herself. The grand jury process is conducted behind closed doors. But she opposes unsealing what her lawyers described as potentially \u201chearsay-laden\u201d transcripts of grand jury testimony. Meanwhile, prosecutors are continuing to urge a court to release some of those records in the criminal case-turned-political fireball.",

      "description": "Texas Democrats prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump. In California, the state's dominant Democrats are maneuvering to counter Trump's Texas play by boosting Democratic House seats in the liberal-leaning state. The rivalry tugging at the nation's political balance is playing out in advance of the 2026 midterm elections, with both parties angling to gain ground in Washington. The Texas map would shore up Republicans\u2019 midterm prospects as the president's political standing slumps. California Democrats are weighing political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state.",

      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering ordering the full reoccupation of the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli media. It would mark a stunning escalation of the nearly 22-month war in the coastal territory that has already been largely destroyed and where experts say famine is unfolding. It would put the lives of countless Palestinians as well as about 20 living hostages at risk, and deepen Israel\u2019s already stark international isolation. It would also face fierce opposition within Israel. Families of the hostages would consider it a virtual death sentence, and much of the security establishment is also reportedly opposed.",

Prison officials say 69-year-old Byron Black died at 10:43 a.m. Tuesday. His defibrillator was left working despite uncertainty about whether the device would shock his heart when the lethal chemicals took effect. Black's attorneys say the defibrillator could shock his heart as the pentobarbital in the lethal injection tried to stop it. Black's lawyer says they will review data kept by the device as well as information from a EKG as part of his autopsy.",

Many aging survivors express frustration over growing global support for nuclear weapons as deterrence. With survivors' numbers rapidly declining and their average age now over 86, this anniversary is a significant milestone. The bombing on Aug. 6, 1945, killed 140,000 people and a second bomb on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more. Representatives from 120 countries, including Russia and Belarus, are expected to attend the ceremony. Survivors and their families plan to pay tribute to the victims at the peace memorial park before the official ceremony.",
